AB  - The fisheries sector in India plays a key role in the Indian economy, providing livelihood to more than 20 million fishers and fish farmers. The Gross Value Added (GVA) of the fisheries sector during 2018–2019 was INR 2,12,915 crores and constituted 1.24% of the total National GVA and 7.28% share of Agricultural GVA. The annual growth rate of 10.88% was achieved during the years 2014–15 to 2018–19. The fish production reached at an all-time high of 13.758 million metric tons during 2018–19. The major fishery resource originates from rivers (29 000 km) followed by reservoirs, ponds, floodplain wetlands, and tanks.Climatic variability and events have intensified in India during the last few decades. This has resulted in frequent cyclones, storms, hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, and untimely monsoons, resulting in climatic disasters. The addition of these unusual climatic events to the increasing anthropogenic stressors would further complicate the dynamics and sustainability of inland fisheries resource especially inland open water resources. These fisheries resources are important for nutrition, employment, income generation, livelihood of fishers contributing >6% of the world's annual animal protein supplies.Tropical inland open water fisheries in India are also vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, biodiversity loss, invasive species and habitat destruction in addition to climate change. Major impacts on inland open waters include change in base flow, altered hydrology, thermal stress to aquatic flora and fauna, extended range and increased occurrence of extreme events, habitat degradation, alteration in breeding and spawning behavior, and life history traits, leading to adverse consequence on aquatic biodiversity and fisheries. This may consequently have more of an impact on the subsistence fishers—their income and livelihood.A detailed publication dealing with the impact of these uncertainties on inland fisheries is not available covering the whole of India. Recent approaches emphasizing ecosystem based management in a regional context specific to inland fisheries for combating climatic changes is either preliminary or lacking so far. In this connection, ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), India has undertaken research under a multi-institutional research project, National Innovations for Climate Resilient Agriculture. Considering the lack of compiled comprehensive information on various aspects of climate change and inland fisheries, the institute has taken the lead in exploring and perusing research during the last decade and fortunately significant progress has been made in this direction.This special issue on climate change and the inland fisheries of India (Fig. 1) is being published due to the active collaboration of CIFRI and Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management Society (AEHMS) and originated from the Pantnagar conference on Inland waters (February 2020). The present issue includes 9 research papers on climate change, which have been categorized in to two groups covering a variety of topics representing the current status of advances and development of climate smart inland fisheries in India:Research advances in climate and environmental change impacts on inland fisheries of India: Status, vulnerability, and mitigation strategiesInvasion meltdown and burgeoning threats of invasive fish species in inland waters of India in the era of climate changeImpacts of climate change and adaptations in shrimp aquaculture: A study in coastal Andhra Pradesh, IndiaAnalysis of constraints faced by fish seed producers of Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone, Assam, India because of extreme climatic events and adaptive strategiesFloodplain wetlands of eastern India in a changing climate: Trophic characterization, ecological status, and implications for fisheriesEcosystem vulnerability of floodplain wetlands of the Lower Brahmaputra Valley, India, to climatic and anthropogenic factorsDynamics of river flows towards sustaining floodplain wetland fisheries under climate change: A case studyEnhanc ng adaptive capacity of wetland fishers through pen culture in the face of a changing climate: A case study from a tropical wetland, IndiaImpact of climate change-induced challenges on fisheries in the North Eastern Region of India, and the way aheadWe hope that this special issue, being first if its kind about India, will enhance our understanding about ecosystem changes due to climate change and its implications on inland fisheries of India (Fig. 2) and the vicinity as well as potential adaptation and mitigation strategies which will be a great help to researchers, managers, students, fishers, planners and policy makers. We take this opportunity to thank the organizers of the Inland water conference in Pantnagar, Utterkhand, namely G.B. Pant University of Agriculture, & Technology, ICAR-CIFRI, and AEHMS (Canada) for convening the conference and providing the opportunity which resulted in the publication of this issue. Thanks are due to Dr. A.P. Sharma for including the climate change session in the program. We are grateful to Dr. Ken Minns, Scientist Emeritus, Fisheries & Oceans Canada for contributing a thoughtful foreword for the special issue. We greatly appreciate the extensive assistance of the technical committee namely, J. Lorimer, M. Holmes and S. Blunt for processing and technical editing of the papers.

AB  - At the East-Frisian coast (Germany) morphological changes of tidal inlets - anthropogenically or naturally caused - can have substantial effects on the sediment supply of adjacent beaches. Erosion periods of beach and dune areas occur, which necessitate engineering countermeasures to preserve the present shoreline. The East-Frisian barrier islands are integrated into the coastal protection strategy for the mainland as they reduce the impact of sea-forces on the flood defences. On the other hand, shoreline and foredunes have to be maintained to protect the urban and tourism infrastructures on the island itself. The maintenance by solid engineering works, like seawalls and groynes, is not favourable because it has drawbacks on the natural morphodynamic processes. Therefore, the technique of beach- and foreshore nourishment is implemented as an instrument of `active coastal protection' whenever possible. The paper deals with an actual erosion problem on the island of Langeoog caused by morphological changes of its tidal inlet Accumer Ee. It discusses the long-term morphological development of the tidal inlet with its ebb delta shoals and of the adjacent shoreline. A coastal engineering solution for the coastal defence problem has been achieved by means of an integrative approach regarding the natural morphological processes, the ecological objectives, and the safety of the island population.

AB  - <jats:p>Marine ecosystems directly and indirectly impact human health, providing benefits such as essential food sources, coastal protection and biomedical compounds. Monitoring changes in marine species is important because impacts such as overfishing, ocean acidification and hypoxic zones can negatively affect both human and ocean health. The US west coast supports a diverse assemblage of deep-sea corals that provide habitats for fish and numerous other invertebrates. Currently, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists manually track the health of coral species using extractive methods. In this paper, we test the viability of using a machine learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify coral species, using field-collected coral images in collaboration with NOAA. We fine tune the hyperparameters of our model to surpass the human F-score. We also highlight a scalable opportunity to monitor ocean health automatically while preserving corals.</jats:p>

AB  - We generated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from 402 individuals of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta collected from 11 native populations and analyzed these data using a combination of demographic, phylogcnetic, and phylogeographic methods to infer features of the evolutionary history of this species. Prior expectations regarding high levels of genetic structure and isolation by distance among populations were supported by the data, but we also discovered several unanticipated patterns. Our analyses revealed a major genetic break between S. invicta mtDNA haplotypes that coincides with the Mesopotamia wetlands region of South America, resulting in two higher level nested clade groupings. In addition, we identified contrasting patterns of genetic differentiation within these two major groups, which may reflect differences in connectivity of suitable habitat in different parts of the native range of S. invicta. Our study represents the first attempt to understand the phylogeographic history of S. invicta across its native range. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution. All rights reserved.

AB  - ABSTRACT Akgul, M.A., Yilmazer, D., Oguz, E., Kabdasli, M.S., Yagci, O., 2013. The effect of an emergent vegetation (i.e. Phragmistes Australis) on wave attenuation and wave kinematics Coastal vegetation acts as a natural barrier at many coastal zones, protecting the landside against wave effects and coastal erosion. It is known that coastal vegetation affects wave properties, and studies regarding this topic have been made in a wide variety, mostly focusing on wave attenuation. In this study, laboratory experiments have been conducted in a wave basin to inspect the effect of an emergent vegetation on wave attenuation, wave transformation and wave kinematics. A blank area is present along the reed field, which enables energy transformation during wave propagation. Three different regular waves have been sent to a natural reed field, and wave heights and kinematics have been measured around the structure. The results indicate that crest-parallel energy transmission takes place as the waves propagate along ...

AB  - The Louisiana Coastal Area presents an array of rich and urgent scientific problems that require new computational approaches. These problems are interconnected with common components: hurricane activity is aggravated by ongoing wetland erosion; water circulation models are used in hurricane forecasts, ecological planning and emergency response; environmental sensors provide information for models of different processes with varying spatial and time scales. This has prompted programs to build an integrated, comprehensive, computational framework for meteorological, coastal, and ecological models. Dynamic and adaptive capabilities are crucially important for such a framework, providing the ability to integrate coupled models with real-time sensor information, or to enable deadline based scenarios and emergency decision control systems. This paper describes the ongoing development of a Dynamic Data Driven Application System for coastal and environmental applications (DynaCode), highlighting the challenges of providing accurate and timely forecasts for hurricane events. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - It has recently been proposed that many communities are structured by a hierarchy of interactions in which facilitation by foundation species is of primary importance. We conducted the first explicit experimental test of this hypothesis by investigating the organization of positive interactions on New England cobblestone beaches. In this midintertidal community, wave-generated substrate instability and solar stress largely limit marine organisms to the shelter of cordgrass beds. Cordgrass, which can establish and persist without the aid of other foundation species, facilitates a dense assemblage of inhabitants ( e. g., mussels, snails, seaweeds) with roots/rhizomes that stabilize substrate and a dense canopy that baffles waves and provides shade. Within the cordgrass bed community, ribbed mussels further enhance physical conditions and densities of other species ( e. g., amphipods, barnacles) by providing crevice space and hard substrate. We conclude that cordgrass bed communities are hierarchically organized: secondary interactions ( e. g., facilitation by ribbed mussels) play a key role within an assemblage dependent on primary facilitation by the independently successful foundation species cordgrass. Our results identify emergent indirect positive interactions in the form of facilitation cascades, have broad implications for conservation, and help unify existing models of community organization that were developed without considering the fundamental role of positive interactions.

AB  - The central Portuguese coast is recognized as the region most vulnerable to coastal erosion in Portugal, with the actual loss of territory exceeding the forecasts used in the 2010-2050 Coastal Zone Management Plan for the Ovar-Marinha sector. Coastal zones do, however, host a wide variety of ecosystems that provide associated services which, as a result, may be lost due to coastal erosion. This study presents the first step in the development of the COastal Protection Investment Support Tool (COPIST), which aids coastal zone managers identifying cost-effective locations for coastal protection works. The objective of this paper is to assess likely ecosystem service value losses resulting from coastal erosion patterns, thereby using a benefits transfer approach in combination with coastal erosion projections. For a case study of the central Portuguese coast it is shown that the total value of coastal ecosystem services equals about (sic)193 million per year, while expected ecosystem service value losses from coastal erosion amount to over (sic)45 million per year by 2058 (i.e. 25% of the concerned coastal ecosystem service values). Given the value of coastal ecosystem services it may, therefore, be worthwhile to protect not only urban territory but also natural and altered coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The shoreline erosion is a major problem that persist world wide and seawall still remain as one of the most widely adopted coastal protection structure. The design of an efficient seawall should be such that overtopping is minimized even during coastal flooding and extreme events by maintaining its crest elevation as low as possible. This can be obtained with curved front face sea walls. Two such curved configurations have been chosen for the study. The experimental investigation on dynamic pressure variation along the surface of the seawall models placed over a bed slope of 1 in 30 and subjected to the action of random waves following the PM spectrum were conducted. The results on the variations of dynamic pressures on the seaward face of both the models along the relative depth are compared and discussed.

AB  - Floodplain plant-herbivore-hydroperiod interactions have received little attention despite their potential as determinants of floodplain structure and functioning. We used five types of exclosures to differentially exclude small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals from accessing Fremont cottonwood (Populus deltoides Marshall subsp. wizlizenii (Watson) Eckenwalder) seedlings and saplings growing naturally on four landform types at an alluvial reach on each of two rivers, the Green and Yampa, in Colorado and Utah. The two study reaches differed primarily as a result of flow regulation on the Green River, which began in 1962. Landforms were a rarely hooded portion of the alluvial plain, geomorphically active slow- and fast-water channel margin sites on the Yampa reach, and an aggrading side channel on the Green. Small-mammal live-trapping and observational data indicated that, with minor exceptions, the kinds of mammals rating cottonwood within each reach were identical. We monitored condition and fates of individual cottonwood plants from October 1993 through the 1997 growing season. Differences in survival and growth were noted both within and between reaches, and both due to, and independent of, mammalian herbivory. Comparisons of cottonwood growth and survivorship among exclosures and between exclosures and controls indicated that a small mammal, Microtus montanus, reduced seedling and sapling survivorship at the Green River reach, but to a lesser extent (seedlings) or not at all (saplings) on the Yampa reach. In contrast, reductions in sapling height increment attributable to medium- and large-sized herbivores were detected only at the Yampa site. We suggest that these differences are a result of (1) flow regulation allowing Microtus populations to escape the mortality normally accompanying the large, snowmelt-driven spring flood, as well as regulation promoting a herbaceous understory favorable to voles, and (2) greater browsing pressure from overwintering deer and elk at the Yampa reach, unrelated to flow regulation. Within areas used by foraging beaver, the probability of a sapling being cut by beaver was similar on the two reaches. This study suggests that changes in riparian plant-herbivore relationships due to shifts in river hydrology may be a common and important consequence of river regulation.

AB  - In the Danish Wadden Sea area the main coastal problem is the risk of flooding while coast erosion only takes place in a few small localities and in larger measure at the peninsula of Skallingen. In the Danish Wadden Sea area some 100 km of dike protects the lowlying areas, the marsh areas, against flooding. Through the years the dike protection has been extended and reinforced. Since the 1970s, the frequency of storm surges has been much higher than earlier in this century. These surges have worn the dikes and many reinforcements have been carried out, and two new dikes have been built protecting the towns Ribe and Højer. The Danish dikes have always been green dikes, i.e. they are grass covered. They are rather easy to reinforce if necessary to withstand also a relative sea level rise caused by the green house effect, the continuing land subsidence in this area or possible more frequent and higher storm surges in the future.

AB  - The four largest Swedish lakes, Vaenern, Vaettern, Hjaelmaren, and Maelaren, were surveyed by means of aerial IR-color photography in the 1970s. Along small slope gradients in all lakes the emergent communities extended to a width of hundreds of meters, while the extent on steeper slopes was a few meters. Because of the fractionate shape, L. Maelaren has a very long shoreline, which promotes vegetation growth in the transition zone between land and water. Sheltered conditions are numerous and water lilies and other floating leaved and freely floating plants are abundant. Emergent as well as submerged macrophytes grow vigorously in the northernmost part of the oligotrophic lake Vaettern. In L. Vaenern exposed shores predominate, but sheltered bays and archipelagos are overgrown with reeds. In the shallow lake Hjaelmaren monospecific stands of Phragmites australis are dominant. Recurrent surveys of L. Maelaren and L. Vaenern in the 1990s showed changes that could be connected to the watertable fluctuations, which have been stabilized since the first investigation. Reeds and water lilies expanded in sheltered parts of the lakes, while the distribution of reed stands growing at their deep limit decreased.

AB  - The objective of the current work is to simulate the influence of a Wave Dragon farm operating in the vicinity of the Romanian nearshore, more precisely in the Mangalia sector. As a first step, the SWAN model was initially used to identify the wave conditions from the vicinity of the target area in order to highlight the main wave characteristics for a ten-year time interval (between 1999 and 2008). Some relevant wave patterns were identified based on this data, which were further used to determine the influence of the Wave Dragon systems on the local wave heights distribution. The physical implementation of the wave farm in the geographical space was possible by considering the obstacle command, which is included in the SWAN model. The shielding effect induced by the wave farm is more significant in the case of the average and extreme scenarios, which suggest that beside the production of electricity such projects, could be considered also suitable for the coastal protection on a local level.

AB  - Bangladesh exemplifies the complex challenges facing densely populated coastal regions. The pressures on the country are immense: around 145 million people live within an area of just 145,000 sq-km at the confluence of three major river systems: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. While progress has been made, poverty remains widespread, with around 39% of children under five malnourished. Most of its land-mass lies below 10m above sea level with considerable areas at sea level, leading to frequent and prolonged flooding during the monsoons. Sea level rise is leading to more flooding as storm surges rise off higher sea levels, pushing further inland. Higher sea levels also result in salt-water intrusion into freshwater coastal aquifers and estuaries, contaminating drinking water and farmland. Warmer ocean waters are also expected to lead to an increase in the intensity of tropical storms. Bangladesh depends on the South Asian summer monsoon for most of its rainfall which is expected to increase, leading to more flooding. Climate scientists are also concerned about the stability of monsoon and the potential for it to undergo a nonlinear phase shift to a drier regime. Bangladesh faces an additional hydrological challenge in that the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers both rise in the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau region, where glaciers are melting rapidly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that rapid melting is expected to increase river flows until around the late-2030s, by which time the glaciers are expected to have shrunk from their 1995 extent of 500,000 sq-km to an expected 100,000 sq-km. After the 2030s, river flows could drop dramatically, turning the great glacier-fed rivers of Asia into seasonal monsoon-fed rivers. The IPCC concluded that as a result, water shortages in Asia could affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. Over the same period, crop yields are expected to decline by up to 30% in South Asia due to a combination of drought and crop heat stress. Bangladesh is therefore likely to face substantial challenges in the coming decades. In order to adequately understand the complex, dynamic, spatial and nonlinear challenges facing Bangladesh, an integrated model of the system is required. An agent-based model (ABM) permits the dynamic interactions of the economic, social, political, geographic, environmental and epidemiological dimensions of climate change impacts and adaptation policies to be integrated via a modular approach. Integrating these dimensions, including nonlinear threshold events such as mass migrations, or the outbreak of conflicts or epidemics, is possible to a far greater degree with an ABM than with most other approaches. We are developing a prototype ABM, implemented in Netlogo, to examine the dynamic impacts on poverty, migration, mortality and conflict from climate change in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2100. The model employs GIS and sub-district level census and economic data and a coarse-graining methodology to allow model statistics to be generated on a national scale from local dynamic interactions. This approach allows a more realistic treatment of distributed spatial events and heterogeneity across the country. The aim is not to generate precise predictions of Bangladesh's evolution, but to develop a framework that can be used for integrated scenario exploration. This paper represents an initial report on progress on this project. So far the prototype model has demonstrated the desirability and feasibility of integrating the different dimensions of the complex adaptive system and, once completed, is intended to be used as the basis for a more detailed policy-oriented model.

AB  - The 1500 km-long coast of South America between the Amazon and the Orinoco river mouths is the world s muddiest. This is due to the huge suspended-sediment discharge of the Amazon River (10(6) x 754 tons yr(-1) +/- 9%) part of which is transported alongshore as mud banks Mud-bank formation is controlled by the physical oceanography of the continental shelf seaward of the Amazon River mouth an initial seafloor storage area for much of the suspended sediment discharged from the river In this area, rapid and sustained fluid-mud concentration and trapping are associated with fresh water-salt water interaction and estuarine front activity on the shelf due to the enormous Amazon water discharge (ca 173 000 m(3)s(-1) at Obidos 900 km upstream of the mouth) Fluid mud is transported shoreward and then along the coasts of the Guianas by a complex interaction of wave and tidal forcing and wind-generated coastal currents The mud banks which may number up to 15 or more at any time are up to 5 m thick, 10 to 60 km-long and 20 to 30 km-wide and each may contain the equivalent mass of the annual mud supply of the Amazon As the banks migrate alongshore their interaction with waves results in complex and markedly fluctuating shorelines that are associated with space- and time-varying depositional bank phases and erosional Inter-bank phases Bank zones are protected from wave attack as a result of wave energy dampening by mud and undergo significant albeit temporary coastal accretion accompanied by rapid mangrove colonization The dampening of waves in bank areas as they propagate onshore is accompanied by the shoreward recycling of mud commonly in the form of individual mud bars These bars progressively undergo desiccation and consolidation and thus constitute a major pathway for rapid and massive colonization by mangroves Erosion by waves propagating across relatively mud-deficient shoreface zones in inter-bank areas can lead to muddy shoreline retreat rates of tens of metres to several kilometres over a few months to a few years accompanied by massive removal of mangroves Notwithstanding the higher incident wave energy on inter-bank shores inter bank shorefaces are permanently muddy due to the pervasive influence of the Amazon muddy discharge Inter bank and transitional bank-to-inter-bank phases are associated with both periodic sandy chenier formation and extreme forms of rotation of rare headland-bound sandy beaches The high mud supply from the Amazon has been the overarching geological control on the Quaternary evolution of the northeastern South American coast having led to the growth of a muddy shelf clinoform at the mouth of the Amazon and more or less important progradation throughout this coast. Net progradation reflects an imbalance in favour of deposition during each mud-bank-inter-bank cycle The high mud supply has presumably blanketed shelf sand deposited by smaller rivers during eustatic lowstand phases The shelf clinoform structure at the mouth of the Amazon and the muddy coastal progradation throughout the coast of the Guianas and into Venezuela provide analogues of the geological record on muddy shorefaces (c) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB  - Coastal erosion processes are often due to inappropriate coastal defense strategies. The construction of infrastructures that interfere with the coastal circulation and the sediment transport along the coast (piers, docks, etc.), the destruction of the dunes and other anthropogenic modifications to the beach, are some of the factors that limit the adaptability of the beach system and amplify the risk of erosion and flooding of the coastal land. Coastal defense interventions have historically been based on the construction of rigid works (seawalls, groins, breakwaters, jetties, etc.), which, while protecting the territory, have often shifted the problem of erosion to the neighboring coasts. The paper will present the contents and the first findings of the research project STIMARE (Innovative strategies, monitoring and analysis of the coastal erosion risk), financed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Sea (MATTM), aimed to define strategies for coastal management, based on a strong involvement of the stakeholders, and on the use of innovative or low-costs technologies for coastal monitoring. Methodology is based on data acquisition, numerical modelling, laboratory tests, physical and ecological monitoring. All the information and results will be discussed with the local stakeholders, in order to provide a comprehensive strategy for coastal protection, following the European Marine Strategy framework. The Project involves researchers from two important Universities in Italy (University of Bologna and Politecnico di Bari) and has a strong interdisciplinary approach, involving coastal engineers, urban planners, geologists, ecologists and mechanical engineers.

AB  - This work presents the approach strategy for the optimization of the coastal defence at a specific site in the Northern Adriatic Sea, the Reno river mouth (Italy). The area is extremely dynamic and vulnerable since exposed to several climate change related effects and in the last decades has suffered strong erosion processes. A rocky revetment covered by a superficial bituminous layer protects this coastal area, but the bad state of conservation makes this defense technique inadequate also during ordinary events. In addition, important morphological variations at the mouth (i.e., the human demolishing of the final part of the right riverside) affected the stability of the protection works and compromised the inland safety. The analysis of multipurpose coastal schemes for flood mitigation and coastal defence of the area is carried out by means of the well-known commercial software MIKE21, that was implemented to simulate waves (SW), currents and levels (HD) and sediment transport (ST). Different sea events from NW (Bora) and SE (Scirocco) were reproduced in the site, also including tidal level, storm surge and river discharge associated to the reproduced storm. Current configuration of the area and alternative defence schemes (i.e. breakwater, groins) to improve coastal protection were simulated and the numerical results were compared in terms of wave load, inundation rate and bed level change. The condition of Bora with the simultaneous presence of high tidal level results to be the most severe event, since the developed longshore current contrasts the river outflow, leading to a high probability of fluvial flooding of the area. The comparative numerical analysis of the different scenarios and configurations allows estimating the optimal coastal protection scheme both in terms of flooding mitigation and erosion reduction and the implemented model can be a useful tool for future studies regarding a so vulnerable and dynamic area.

AB  - A cluster of artesian springs encircled by mounds of marsh and wet meadows was discovered near the equator in Kenya, East Africa. Each spring is capped by a dense fibrous root mat that covers a mound of clayey peat with a blister of water in the center. Individual mounds are 15 m wide, 12 m high, and affect an area of 50 m2. The central water-blister volume is <1 m3. The arched semi-permeable vegetation cap appears to be buoyed upward by slow artesian flow that leaks through the cap and moves slowly away. Lush plant growth (Poaceae and Cyperaceae, algae, diatoms, and filamentous cyanobacteria) is supported even through the dry season (Dec.Feb.). The term artesian blister wetland is proposed for this unusual marsh, which has not been described previously. Approximately 20 small, circular-to-oval artesian blister wetlands occur within a large spring and wetland complex (1.3 km2) that includes several freshwater Typha marshes fed by ground-water seeps. The springs discharge along a rift-related fracture system near the contact between volcanic bedrock and late Quaternary sediments. Cores (12 m) through the mounds revealed a dense root mat underlain by water in the center and a clayey peat that is locally pebbly at the base surrounding the blister. LOI in the clayey peat decreases from 75 at surface to 10 at 0.41.2 m. Blister water is cool, fresh, and dysaerobic (T 3033 C; pH 6.27.2; conductivity 600 S/cm; and DO 50; 0.63.5 mg/l). The spring/wetland mounds likely form by the blanketing of the land around the spring orifice with vegetation (paludification). Plants and cyanobacteria seem to trap sediment transported by surface run-off and wind. The mound grows with time, but its height is limited by the magnitude of the hydraulic head. These ecological niches are important freshwater resources for animals and humans in semi-arid environments.

AB  - Freshwater environments are important for ecosystem services and biodiversity. These environments are subject to many natural and anthropogenic changes, which influence their quality; therefore, regular monitoring is required for their effective management. High biotic heterogeneity, elongated land/water interaction zones, and logistic difficulties with access make field based monitoring on a large scale expensive, inconsistent and often impractical. Remote sensing (RS) is an established mapping tool that overcomes these barriers. However, complex and heterogeneous vegetation and spectral variability due to water make freshwater environments challenging to map using remote sensing technology. Satellite images available for New Zealand were reviewed, in terms of cost, and spectral and spatial resolution. Particularly promising image data sets for freshwater mapping include the QuickBird and SPOT-5. However, for mapping freshwater environments a combination of images is required to obtain high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution. Data fusion (DF) is a framework of data processing tools and algorithms that combines images to improve spectral and spatial qualities. A range of DF techniques were reviewed and tested for performance using panchromatic and multispectral QB images of a semi-aquatic environment, on the southern shores of Lake Taupo, New Zealand. In order to discuss the mechanics of different DF techniques a classification consisting of three groups was used -(i) spatially-centric (ii) spectrally-centric and (iii) hybrid. Subtract resolution merge (SRM) is a hybrid technique and this research demonstrated that for a semi aquatic QuickBird image it out performed Brovey transformation (BT), principal component substitution (PCS), local mean and variance matching (LMVM), and optimised high pass filter addition (OHPFA). However some limitations were identified with SRM, which included the requirement for predetermined band weights, and the over-representation of the spatial edges in the NIR bands due to their high spectral variance. This research developed three modifications to the SRM technique that addressed these limitations. These were tested on QuickBird (QB), SPOT-5, and Vexcel aerial digital images, as well as a scanned coloured aerial photograph. A visual qualitative assessment and a range of spectral and spatial quantitative metrics were used to evaluate these modifications. These included spectral correlation and root mean squared error (RMSE), Sobel filter based spatial edges RMSE, and unsupervised classification. The first modification addressed the issue of predetermined spectral weights and explored two alternative regression methods (Least Absolute Deviation, and Ordinary Least Squares) to derive image-specific band weights for use in SRM. Both methods were found equally effective; however, OLS was preferred as it was more efficient in processing band weights compared to LAD. The second modification used a pixel block averaging function on high resolution panchromatic images to derive spatial edges for data fusion. This eliminated the need for spectral band weights, minimised spectral infidelity, and enabled the fusion of multi-platform data. The third modification addressed the issue of over-represented spatial edges by introducing a sophisticated contrast and luminance index to develop a new normalising function. This improved the spatial representation of the NIR band, which is particularly important for mapping vegetation. A combination of the second and third modification of SRM was effective in simultaneously minimising the overall spectral infidelity and undesired spatial errors for the NIR band of the fused image. This new method has been labelled Contrast and Luminance Normalised (CLN) data fusion, and has been demonstrated to make a significant contribution in fusing multi-platform, multi-sensor, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal data. This contributes to improvements in the classification and monitoring of fresh water environments using remote sensing.

AB  - ABSTRACT Nor Aslinda, A.; Wan Hasliza, W.J., and Mohd Radzi, A.H., 2014. Coastal erosion at Tanjong Piai, Johor, Malaysia. Tanjung Piai, Johor, Malaysia, is a ramsar site, located at the southern-most tip of mainland Asia, and consists mainly of mudflats and mangrove forests. The coast has experienced severe erosion for several decades, in spite of the construction of various coastal defense structures. The reported rates of shoreline retreat were between 2 to 4 m/year. Hydrodynamic modeling using 2008 field data indicate that the maximum current speed observed along the east coast of Tanjung Piai ranges from 0.2 - 0.5 m/s, while the west coast experiences lower current speeds of less than 0.2 m/s. Strong currents occur at the tip of Tanjung Piai with a speed of 0.5 to 0.8 m/s. The simulation also indicates that some local current patterns are formed near the tip due to the presence of a small island as the flow entering the study area during flooding were reflected to the east while the flow during the e...

AB  - A spill of heavy fuel oil in the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, North Carolina, impacted approximately 30 miles of shoreline. The vegetation was of a high marsh type dominated by species of Spartina, Scirpus, and Juncus. The particular water-insoluble, hydrophobic characteristics of the oil caused it to adhere predominantly to marsh vegetation. To determine the amount of oil onshore it was necessary to determine marsh grass surface areas. Aerial reconnaissance established the locations of major, moderate, and low impact areas and allowed the production of an environmental data map. Ground reconnaissance was used to obtain widths of impacted marsh and to identify dominant marsh vegetation components. Transect measurements completed the data acquisition and yielded surface areas. The amount of surface area submerged at mean high tide (and, therefore, subject to oiling) was determined separately for Spartina alterniflora, S. cynosuroides, Scirpus olneyi, and Juncus effusus. Geometric formulas used were based upon the surface morphology of each plank. A stepwide procedure is given for application of the methods to other spills and to other common marsh species. Surface areas for flowering S. alterniflora ranged from about 700-to-l. 500 square centimeters per plant. The leaf area was approximately twice the area of the stem. Revisits to the spill site indicated that much of the oil had been exported from lightly oiled areas, and that these areas had recovered. However, heavily oiled areas showed a reduction in total plants per square meter and much contamination of surface sediments and substrate.

AB  - ABSTRACT Oil spill research and development has involved a large number of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and the effects of marine shoreline protection and cleanup techniques. Considerable knowledge has accumulated from laboratory and wave tank studies, and there have also been a number of field experiments, in which oil was intentionally spilled on shorelines under controlled conditions. This review summarizes those field experiments, which are grouped in five major habitat types: rocky intertidal, cobble/pebble/gravel, sand/mud, saltmarshes, and mangroves/seagrasses. Tables included in the paper itemize the oil type and volume, location and substrate character, number and size of plots, response techniques tested, and referenced publications. This information is then used to combine understanding of the effectiveness of cleanup with understanding of the ecological effects of cleanup methods, compared with those of untreated oil. It is very difficult to achieve this type of information and un...

AB  - Abstract. Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5–10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

AB  - During the period of construction of a storm-surge barrier current velocities decreased strongly and the Eastern compartment of the basin obtained a lagoon-like character. The rotifer Synchaeta spp., already abundant in the neighbouring salt and brackish lakes, profited from this condition. Higher and less fluctuating salinities caused the estuarine character of this compartment to disappear in the post-barrier years. This was reflected in the obscured succession of some Acartia species: the estuarine A. tonsa dominated in pre-barrier- and barrier years during summer, while the marine A. clausi was abundant in the post-barrier Oosterschelde during that time. Also the changed food conditions (Bakker & Vink, 1993) may have played a role in this phenomenon. Further changes in species composition were hardly observed. The main changes were of a quantitative nature (Bakker & Van Rijswijk, 1993; Tackx et al., 1993). A list of the commonly occurring species is given. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The concept of ecological integrity has become a worldwide phenomenon and is firmly entrenched into the regulatory structure of environmental law in the United States of America (USA). The attainment of ecological integrity requires the attainment of its three elements: physical, chemical, and biological integrity. In the USA, measures of chemical integrity were implemented first into monitoring programs and were effective in reducing pollutant loadings to the nation's surface waters. Because biological communities integrate the effects of different stressors such as reduced oxygen, excess nutrients, toxic chemicals, increased temperature, excessive sediment loading, and habitat degradation, the advent of bioassessment in regulatory programs has provided a more comprehensive and effective monitoring and assessment strategy. Measures of biological integrity clearly have become a priority in the USA. The development of biological criteria (biocriteria) within regulatory programs to serve as thresholds by which to judge the attainment of designated aquatic life conditions of surface waters is a major focus of states and Indian tribes within the USA. The derivation of reference conditions for the nation's surface waters (i.e., streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters) across different physiographic regions is a critical element in the design of biocriteria and is currently a primary initiative in the USA. Nearly all state water resource agencies have developed bioassessment approaches for streams; 1600 to 75 000 km of streams require assessment in each state. Bioassessment development for other water body types is not as advanced to date. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has produced technical guidance for developing effective bioassessment programs; they include crucial elements such as defining objectives, classifying water bodies according to expected biological attributes, deriving the reference condition of the site classes, developing standardized protocols for sampling and data analysis, and implementing a quality assurance plan. Approaches to bioassessment in the USA follow a basic design of incorporating various attributes of the elements and processes of the aquatic community, which is either an aggregation into a multimetric index or a series of multivariate analyses using the attributes as input variables. The Clean Water Act of 1972 and its subsequent amendments mandate maintaining, restoring, and protecting the ecological integrity of surface waters. Through use of robust bioassessments and other measures of ecological integrity, the USA has developed a strategic plan to establish priorities to meet this goal.

AB  - River restoration and bioengineering programs commonly use vegetation to stabilize banks. For this, it is important to know the forces that the flowing river water exerts on the vegetation. To this end, a laboratory study was performed at the USDA-ARS National Sedimentation Laboratory. Dowels were used to simulate emergent rigid vegetation. Dowels were systematically placed in the laboratory flume, beginning with a single dowel connected to a load cell to measure the drag force and then placing dowels around the single dowel to determine any shielding effect. It was found that the drag coefficient of a single dowel ranged from 4.5 to 6.5, which is higher than that published for a 2-D cylinder of infinite length. A momentum balance analysis shows that (1) for the single dowel case, the momentum balance approach determines CD>>1 contrary to the low values for a cylinder and (2) the CD for the measured dowel is about two times higher than the momentum formulation. This difference is attributed to the presence of large standing waves upstream of the dowel and the breaking of these waves. When additional vegetation elements were added to form a matrix, it was found that as vegetation elements were added, the drag forced increased initially due to the vegetation concentrating the flow towards the instrumented dowel, and then decreased due to dowels being directly upstream of the instrumented dowel and thereby blocking the flow. These results have implications for managed planting arrangements in stream corridor rehabilitation programs.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are being lost globally at an alarming rate due to deforestation, reclamation, and urbanization. Not only is the loss of these ecosystems detrimental to the commercially and ecologically important marine species they support, there is also a reduction in the ecosystem services they provide, namely mitigating rising carbon dioxide levels by serving as carbon sinks. These ecosystems, labeled as "blue carbon" sinks, potentially sequester more than 10 times the carbon that tropical and temperate ecosystems do. Thus, conservation and restoration of these blue carbon sinks is imperative. We explored how much carbon is currently stored in dwarf red mangrove Rhizophora mangle biomass in tidal creeks of Eleuthera, Bahamas. In October of 2012, four sites were selected near Cape Eleuthera, maximizing site variability All sampling was done from six plots established at each site. The quantity of carbon stored in mangroves was determined from plant biomass, which was extrapolated from plant volumes. Mangrove volumes were determined from growth parameters of individuals. It was observed that there were large differences from site to site in number of individuals, sediment depth, biomass accumulation, and carbon allocation of mangroves, but the total amount of carbon stored from site to site in mangroves did not differ. The site with the greatest biomass and carbon storage also had the greatest sediment depth, suggesting a correlation between the two. Regardless of the site to site variability, mangroves proved to be good stores for carbon. Future work should search for the factors that explain site to site variability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of climate variability and land-use change in the Susquehanna river basin on the sedimentary regime of the Upper Chesapeake Bay, USA. Historical precipitation, stream discharge, land use, suspended sediment and dam reservoir capacity data were used to interpret regional patterns of erosion and sediment transport on annual, decadal and centennial time-scales. Sediment accumulation patterns in the Upper Chesapeake Bay were inferred from the analysis of four piston cores including 14C dating, magnetic susceptibility and laser particle analysis techniques. Core magnetic susceptibility profiles were found to be a useful tool for stratigraphic correlation on the order of centimeters. On annual to decadal time-scales, a strong relationship was found between sediment yield and regional rainfall-runoff patterns and land surface erodibility. However, on centennial time-scales, our research suggests that anthropogenic land-use change (e.g., clear-cutting of native forests) has caused up to an order of magnitude increase in sediment accumulation rates in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, the signature of extreme hydrologic events such as large floods and droughts, and thus Anatural@ climate variability, was "aliased" from the estuarine sedimentation patterns over the last 150 years. The construction of major dams around 1930 on the Lower Susquehanna River has resulted in a significant decrease in coarse fraction of sediment inputs into the estuary, further reducing our ability to separate flood episodes from average conditions.

AB  - Sediment is a fragmented material, primarily formed by the physical and chemical disintegration of rocks from the earth`s crust. These particles range in size from large boulders to colloidal size fragments and vary in shape from rounded to angular and vary in specific gravity, and mineral composition (Rijn, L. C. V. 1993). Sediment materials are classified and named based on their grain sizes. In a tropical peat coast, the sediment consists of sand, mud, and peat debris. The distribution of these grain size becomes very important because it connects to the sediment depository behind detached breakwater which leads to the recovery process of coastal erosion (mangrove replanting activity). This paper discusses the sediment grain size distribution behind detached breakwaters from the assessment of the field activity and numerical approach. The existing detached breakwater that was installed at the northern part of Bengkalis Island is called the Selatbaru coast. The measurements are based on geo-informatics composed of both terrestrial surveys and photogrammetry. For grain size measurement, we used image analysis and laser analysis methods. A 1D cross-shore profile model of Xbeach was chosen. The model used the option to define spatially varying sediment grain size. With this feature, it becomes possible to simulate the beach profile response to wave and tidal action in a variety of grain sizes. Analyzing the relationship between the field activity and numerical calculation of sediment grain size distribution will help determine recovery process to coastal erosion especially in the tropical coast of Bengkalis Island, Indonesia.

AB  - The Elf company has developed a preventive means of fighting oil spills, involving a film forming product which must be applied to areas to be protected before they are reached by hydrocarbons. The goal is to reduce the adhesiveness of hydrocarbons, thus minimizing their ecological and aesthetic impact on coastal zones. The effectiveness of the product has already been tested by means of various experiments carried out on miscellaneous substrata. Simply washing the area with cold water under low pressure is sufficient to detach the oil from soiled surfaces where, usually, it is necessary to resort to high pressure hoses (possibly using hot water or even detergents). It is then possible to envisage, using traditional methods, to recover the petrol from the surface of the water. This paper discusses the results of impact studies which were carried out recently in various coastal ecosystems: sandy, rocky and salt-marsh sediments. Follow-up of sedimentary fauna and marsh flora have not revealed any impact, not even on the most sensitive ecosystems. Procedures for applying the film forming product using tools available in stocks of prevention equipment are also discussed. An experiment timetable has made it possible to optimize the next use of a spreading system using helicopters (Simplex), commonly used to apply dispersants.

AB  - Waihi Beach is an example of chronic erosive tendency. The erosion problem is particularly bad at the northern end where a rock seawall was constructed in the 1960s in an attempt to protect coastal property at risk from coastal erosion and flooding hazards. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to identify and evaluate the fundamental coastal processes impacting upon erosion at Waihi Beach. Measured wave and current data combined with bathymetric and sediment data indicated that nearshore current velocities alone are incapable of inducing sediment movement and require wave motion to initiate entrainment. A net onshore flux of 2.6 m(3)/m/year was calculated for Waihi Beach, despite persistent rip currents at the far northern end of the beach producing offshore sediment transport at that location. The numerical wave model WBEND is used to examine the influence of wave refraction and convergence caused by Mayor Island and large shore-normal sand ridges (eta=0.4-2.5 m, lambda=300-1400 m) revealed by side-scan sonar, on the distribution of wave energy along the coast. Using average wave conditions, a zone of wave convergence caused by refraction around Mayor Island was found to produce enhanced wave heights along a particularly erosive sector of the beach fronting the seawall. Zones of wave convergence caused by wave refraction over the offshore sand ridges were found to produce variation in alongshore breaking wave heights.

AB  - Shark River Inlet, located on the north New Jersey coast, is served by a federal navigation channel that has until recently required little maintenance dredging. Although possessing a small estuary, the inlet is hydraulically efficient because of the small width to depth ratio of its entrance that is stabilized by parallel jetties. After placement of approximately 4.8 million m3 of beach nourishment to the north and south of the inlet as part of an erosion-control project conducted in the late 1990s, inlet maintenance increased beyond that anticipated. Analysis of channel and nearshore surveys indicates that an ebb-tidal delta is forming where none had existed previously, attributed to the recent availability of sand from the beach nourishment and a lack of sand prior to that construction. Jetty tip shoals also encroach on the channel, dependent on season, with longshore transport directed primarily to the north during summer (the predominant direction of transport) and to the south during winter. Formation of the ebb delta must be accounted for in the sand budget of the adjacent beaches. After conducting a GIS analysis of ebb delta growth to understand geomorphic trends, the Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was established to numerically simulate waves, current, sand transport, and morphology change. The CMS reproduced observed trends in ebb-delta growth, and multi-year simulations indicate the time scale of approach to dynamic equilibrium of the ebb delta and establishment of natural sand bypassing at the inlet.

AB  - <jats:p><p><b>Coastal lagoons are important, but fragile ecosystems, which host diverse biological assemblages. However, these ecosystems are becoming increasingly exposed to anthropogenic stressors such as ocean warming and eutrophication. Sponges are important suspension feeders and are often important components of coastal lagoon communities. However, the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on lagoon-inhabiting sponges are poorly understood. This thesis examines the effects of elevated temperature and eutrophication on the physiological responses and temporal dynamics of three lagoon-inhabiting sponges, Neopetrosia chaliniformis, Amphimedon navalis and Spheciospongia vagabunda from Mauritius (western Indian Ocean). The effects of elevated temperature on A. navalis proteome dynamics and on the bentho-pelagic interactions of S. vagabunda were also explored. </b></p><p>In the first data chapter, I conducted a multifactorial experiment to investigate the short-term physiological responses of N. chaliniformis, A. navalis and S. vagabunda exposed to nine combinations of temperature and nitrate treatments for 14 days. Temperature treatments for this experiment were chosen based on the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways, i.e. RCP6.0 (+2 oC) and RCP8.5 (+4 oC) projected for the year 2100. Nitrate concentrations were increased to approximately two- and three-fold the actual nitrate concentrations in the lagoons where sponges were collected. After 14 days of exposure, the photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and effective quantum yield of the two photosynthetic species (N. chaliniformis and S. vagabunda), as well as the buoyant weight of all species declined significantly. The gross photosynthetic rates and P:R ratios of N. chaliniformis and S. vagabunda also declined significantly, but the respiration rates of all species were significantly higher. The results from this chapter demonstrated that while lagoon-inhabiting sponges are susceptible to short term exposure to elevated temperatures, they are generally tolerant to elevated nitrate concentrations. </p><p>For my second data chapter, I conducted a four-week thermal tolerance experiment to investigate the physiological tolerance of these three sponges to elevated temperature. I also explored the proteomic responses of A. navalis to elevated temperature. The results showed that the physiology of N. chaliniformis and A. navalis were impacted over time, where after one-week of thermal exposure, both species experienced significant loss in buoyant weight and increases in pumping and holobiont oxygen consumption rates, respectively. In contrast, the bioeroding sponge S. vagabunda experienced an increase in buoyant weight over time and after a thermal exposure of two weeks, the effective quantum yield, pumping and holobiont oxygen consumption rates of this species appeared to stabilize, indicating the possible acclimation of this species to longer thermal exposure. A. navalis proteomic analysis after four weeks revealed significant changes in the expression of 50 proteins, which were mainly involved in oxidative stress, protein transport and cytoskeletal organization. These results demonstrate that medium- or long-term thermal experiments are more indicative of possible species-specificity and acclimation potential in sponges. Moreover, this study also demonstrates that thermal stress responses are also reflected at the proteome level and that a combination of physiology and proteomics can further enhance our understanding of stress mechanisms in sponges. </p><p>In my third data chapter, I aimed to assess the temporal variability in local distribution area (LDA), abundance and percentage cover of N. chaliniformis, A. navalis and S. vagabunda, respectively over a six- to eight-year period. I also aimed to explore the possible relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (used as a proxy for eutrophication), and temporal variability of these sponges. I found that while he LDA and percentage cover of N. chaliniformis decreased by 40.2% and 14.6%, those of S. vagabunda increased by 135.1% and 23.3%, respectively. No significant changes were observed in A. navalis LDA and percentage cover. A significant decline was seen in the abundance of N. chaliniformis and A. navalis, whereas a significant increase was noted for S. vagabunda abundance. N. chaliniformis and A. navalis abundance declines were likely due to a reduction in lagoonal coral cover, which often act as anchoring substrate for these sponges. The abundance of all species was significantly correlated with SST and Chl a concentration, but the nature of these correlations was species-specific. These results showed that lagoon-inhabiting sponges demonstrate species-specific temporal dynamics, which are mostly driven by changes in seawater temperature. </p><p>For my final data chapter, I aimed to estimate the bacterial cell consumption, Chl a uptake, net dissolved organic carbon uptake and net inorganic nutrient release of S. vagabunda when exposed to elevated seawater temperature. The results from this chapter indicated that the bacterial cell consumption and S. vagabunda bentho-pelagic interactions with the water column are relatively low compared to other shallow coastal sponges for which data are available. However, under future ocean warming scenarios RCP6.0 (+2 oC) and RCP8.5 (+4 oC), S. vagabunda bacterial cell consumption, net dissolved organic carbon uptake and net inorganic nutrient release would likely increase by 115% and 142%, respectively. These results suggest that thermally tolerant lagoon-inhabiting sponges would likely have an enhanced bentho-pelagic role in future anthropogenically-impacted lagoons, although based on current abundance, S. vagabunda has limited bentho-pelagic interactions with the water column. </p><p>In summary, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the responses of lagoon-inhabiting sponges to elevated temperature are species-specific. While some species are thermally susceptible to elevated temperature, other species such as S. vagabunda may have a potential to acclimate to at least short-term thermal stress. Consequently, thermally-tolerant species could potentially have an increasing bentho-pelagic role in coastal lagoons under future climate change scenarios. The impacts of thermal stress in sponges can also occur at the proteome level, where cellular biological functions such as redox reactions, protein transport and cytoskeletal organization are significantly disrupted. Furthermore, elevated temperature can equally contribute to the temporal variability of some lagoon-inhabiting sponge species. In contrast, this study demonstrated that lagoon-inhabiting sponges are most likely tolerant to eutrophication. Given that sponges are important components of coastal lagoons, it is critically important to assess and incorporate their potential roles to the ecological functioning of anthropogenically-impacted coastal lagoons. </p></jats:p>

AB  - Flooding of the southern part of the North Sea occurred between 9000 and 8000 BP, when the rate of relative sea-level rise was on the order of 0.7 cm per year for the Dover Strait Region and 1.6 cm per year for the area north of the Frisian Islands, forcing the shoreline to recede rapidly. When relative sea-level rise decelerated after 7000 BP for the Belgian coast and 6000 BP for the central Netherlands coast, sediment supply by the tidal currents balanced the creation of accommodation space in the estuaries and other back-barrier basins. Consequently, the barrier started to stabilize, and the tidal basins and their inlets silted up. Between 5500 and 4500 BP, the Belgian coastal plain changed into a freshwater marsh with peat accumulation, and the same happened 500-1000 years later in the western provinces of the Netherlands. The E-W running barrier/back-barrier system of the Frisian Islands in the northern Netherlands stayed open until today, however, because of lower sediment supply. The period between 4000 and 2000 BP was relatively quiet due to the strong deceleration of the rate of sea-level rise; peat cushions developed behind the barriers, which were straightened by erosion of the headlands. Major and often catastrophic flooding occurred in the Middle Ages, when the estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands formed. About 226 (+/- 15%) x 10(9) m(3) sediment, mostly sand, is stored in the barriers and back-barrier basins of the Netherlands, 70% of which was deposited prior to 5000 BP. About 10% of the stored sediment is estimated to be of alluvial origin. Most of the sediment is derived by the erosion of the Pleistocene basement during recession of the barriers, but tide-induced cross-shore transport from the North Sea forms an additional source for the barriers and back-barriers of the west-facing coast of the Netherlands.

AB  - Purpose. The paper is aimed at investigating the propagation of solitons in a shallow basin, assessing the nonlinear effects resulting from the wave run-up on a gentle coast, and at comparing the estimates obtained using different numerical models with the available analytical dependencies. Methods and Results. The results of numerical simulations carried out using two nonlinear models of long waves (the author's model and the Simulating WAves till SHore (SWASH) one) are represented in the paper. The solitary wave profiles were obtained during its propagation in the part of a basin with constant depth conjugated with the inclined bottom. The process of a wave run-up on the coast was simulated using the algorithm of fluid movement along a dry coast. It is shown that when a soliton propagates in the basin part with constant depth, the nonlinearity effects are manifested in deformation of a wave profile. In other words, increase of the wave initial amplitude and the distance traveled by a wave is accompanied by growth of the wave front slope steepness. This, in its turn, leads to increase of a splash when the waves run-up on the coast. The estimates of the run-up heights resulted from different numerical models are in good agreement. Conclusions. The calculated values of the maximum wave run-up on the coast for the non-deformed waves, the length of which is equal to that of the traversed path, are close to the estimates obtained analytically. For the waves with the deformed profile, the front slope steepness of which increases with propagation over long distances, the run-up heights increase with growth of the wave initial amplitude. In such a case, it is desirable to replace the analytical estimates with the numerical ones. The run-up height of the deformed waves can exceed the wave initial amplitude by four or more times. The results obtained in this study can be useful in projecting the coastal protection constructions with the regard for preserving the coastal ecology and economy.

AB  - Background. The structure of benthic diatom assemblages (diversity, equitability, dominance) may be useful in assessing their ecological status in natural protected areas. Goals. To describe the structure of epipelic diatom assemblages from Laguna Guerrero Negro (LGN), a protected coastal lagoon, and test the hypothesis that H'diversity values would be higher for diatom assemblages in LGN sediments than in typical benthic diatom assemblages. Methods. Sediment samples were collected in the lagoon on November 2013, and January, March, and July 2014. Diatoms were mounted on permanent slides and examined at 1000x using phase contrast microscopy. In each slide, 500 valves were counted to compute relative abundances of each taxon, and species diversity, equitability, and dominance, using Shannon (H'), Pielou (J'), and Simpson (lambda) indices, respectively. Likewise, similarity between samples was measured. The calculated median value of H' from LGN was compared to previously recorded median values to test the hypothesis that significant differences exist. Results. A total 225 diatom taxa were counted. With few exceptions, the similarity between samples was <60%. Relative abundances depict typical benthic diatom assemblages, with an average H' = 4.96 bits/taxon, and corresponding values of equitability and dominance. The median value of H' (Md = 4.9) was significantly higher than the median value (Md = 3.7) found in previous studies. Conclusions. The structure of the epipelic diatom assemblages from LGN and their patchy distribution are similar to that of typical diatom assemblages, but with unusually high values of H' that lead us to reject the statistical null hypothesis and thus sustain our research hypothesis.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of marshes on simulated waves as an extension of the Louisiana Joint Storm Surge (JSS) modeling study that included wind modeling, Gulf of Mexico- and regional-scale wave modeling, surge modeling, and nearshore wave modeling. The modeling system included one-way and, for nearshore waves and surge, two-way interactions between the models. Simulations conducted for this study apply the methods developed within the Louisiana JSS study with a focus on marsh vegetation (bottom friction coefficients) and topography in the Caernarvon Marsh of coastal Louisiana. Evaluation of the local wave height for selected storms simulations with varying marsh parameters provides insight to the importance of limiting marsh loss and qualitative assessment of potential management alternatives. STWAVE simulations indicate that including bottom friction energy dissipation can significantly reduce the wave energy for the conditions tested in the study. Analysis of wave parameters and spectra at various locations in the study marsh highlight the effect of the bottom dissipation on wave energy. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The Antarctic region comprises the continent and surrounding sea south of the Antarctic Convergence, where cold Antarctic upper water sinks and mixes with warmer sub-Antarctic water. The continent, nearly centered on the South Geographic Pole, is isolated by the Southern Ocean from other land masses. The continent's mean elevation is about 2,000 m and 98% of the surface is mantled by 2,000 m or more of glacial ice which flows toward coastal outlets to the sea. The ice sheet is pierced by mountain summits, some approaching altitudes near 5,000 m. The continental shelf mean width is 30 km. On its seaward edge the shelf is at depths of 400 to over 600 m. The total area of ice and snow surface presented by the region is doubled by the maximum extent of sea ice each year. The Antarctic Continent is the principal heat sink of the world weather machine. Upwelling areas of the Southern Ocean recycle nutrients and stimulate the marine ecosystem, and seasonal changes in extent of sea ice contribute to one of the greatest annual pulses in marine organic production. The fish fauna has only 120 species but these belong to 29 families. The zooplankton is rich in several endemic crustacea, notably the Antarctic krill. The only vertebrates on land come from the sea onto shore areas and fast ice, including colonies of breeding penguins and associated birds as well as seals. Closed communities of vascular plants and cryptogams occur on sub-Antarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, but in the entire continental Antarctic the vegetation is desert-like, composed of scattered mosses, lichens, and terrestrial algae. Exposed surfaces of crystalline rocks harbor "endolithic microbial life," and a few species of invertebrates dwell on favorably exposed soil and under rocks. The ice Plateau is as nearly abiotic or sterile as any area on the earth's surface. The physical and biotic features of Antarctica represent extreme conditions. The continent was untouched by man until the past two centuries and remains nearly pristine. It yields key information about cold environments and global environmental systems including evidences of change, and deserves protection from unnecessary disturbance. © 1987.

AB  - Techniques for revegetation of foredunes in New Zealand were investigated using three indigenous sand-binding species: pingao, spinifex and sand tussock. Emphasis was placed on the development of guidelines from research trials designed to investigate the rehabilitation of dunes by planting nursery-raised seedlings. The aim was to promote successful techniques that will be of use to coastal managers and community-based interest groups such as Beach Care and Coast Care. Seed characteristics and methods for collection/preparation of seed are described. Pingao and sand tussock seedlings can be raised in large numbers in a nursery. Difficulties in raising spinifex seedlings at reasonable cost arise from low plant vigour and high mortality. Although transplanting of stolons and direct field seeding of spinifex are used successfully for management-scale restoration of sand dunes in New South Wales, trials in New Zealand have shown low survival rates from transplanted stolons and poor germination and growth after direct seeding. Nursery-raised seedlings of all three species established successfully in trials in several North Island coastal areas and along the beaches near Christchurch. The most favourable planting site for sand-binders was the seaward face of the mobile foredune just above high water level, providing that only moderate sand accumulation is expected. Plant growth was significantly increased by the application of a slow-release fertiliser (Magamp) at time of planting in trials on the less exposed beaches of the eastern North Island. More active sand movement on the west coast of the North Island and along the Christchurch beaches was thought to increase nutrient supply to planted seedlings, but may cause high mortality at exposed sites by burying plants. Because nursery-raised seedlings and planting-out the both expensive, consideration should be given to the alternative strategy of enhancing existing populations of sand-binding species. In either case the plants will require protection from human and animal activity. In the coastal environment, setbacks due to excessive sand accretion or erosion associated with storm events must be expected and should be rectified as soon as possible. The development of a frontal dune with a continuous cover of vigorous sand-binding vegetation is seen as an achievable objective in coastal areas with a high amenity value. The most desirable end-result for the foredune habitat would be a self-sustaining ecosystem based on indigenous species.

AB  - Biodeposits from farmed mussels severely influence the biogeochemistry of sediments by increasing the levels of organic matter (OM). Mitigation of such negative impacts is important for the development of sustainable aquaculture operations. As a step towards developing methods for remediation of coastal sediments affected by mussel farming, the effects of the polychaete, Hediste diversicolor was evaluated experimentally. In a series of field- and laboratory experiments we tested hypotheses about the effects of polychaetes on sediment oxygen consumption, nutrient fluxes and sulphide pools under different polychaete densities and sedimentation regimes. The experimental results support the idea that polychaetes can mitigate negative effects on the benthic environment beneath mussel farms. H. diversicolor oxidized the sediment and generally enhanced the oxygen consumption, and thus the decomposition of OM. The accumulation of pore water sulphides were reduced and fluxes of nutrients across the sediment-water interface increased. Additional calculations suggest that the effects of polychaetes were mainly indirect and driven by increased microbial activity due to the borrowing activity of the polychaetes. Trends of increasing decomposition with increasing polychaete density suggest that the decomposition could be further enhanced by higher densities. Overall, we concluded that H. diversicolor is a potentially strong candidate for remediation of mussel farm sediments. The results show that sediments inhabited by H. diversicolor have high assimilative capacity of OM and oxygen conditions are significantly improved following the addition of polychaetes at naturally occurring densities. However, technological developments are needed in order to allow the approach to be used in practice.

AB  - Anticipated acceleration of sea level rise in combination with expected higher set-up of storm surges will require strengthening of coastal protection structures. Therefore a research project was started to quantify the resistance of the dyke body depending on the detailed hydrodynamic loads. For the evaluation of the hydrodynamic loads the mathematical model OTT-1d from HR Wallingford is chosen which has been modified by the Coastal Research Station with respect to real world conditions. The verification was done on the basis of distinct wave flume tests and recently by comparison with prototype measurements. In Petten in the Netherlands a large measurement site is operational to monitor waves and wave run-up. In 2006 the measurement site was extended by an overtopping device. The first data sets are used here to validate the model OTT-1d. Measured data of four storm surges are compared with the calculated ones to verify the generality of the model. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The construction of the James Bay hydroelectric power project in subarctic Canada started in 1972, but environmental information that would permit mitigation measures did not become available until about 1975. Some environmental and social impact case studies are presented in this paper with regard to the LaGrande Complex phase of the James Bay development. The environmental impact case study involves the subsystem of estuarine fisheries and the effect on it of changes in the flow regime of the LaGrande River, the relocation of the first dam (LG-1) on the LaGrande, saltwater encroachment up the river during the filling of the second dam (LG-2), and the changes in the thermal regime of the river. The social impact case study examines the effect of the road network associated with the hydro development, on the land tenure system of the native Cree Indians of the area. The behaviour of developers, as they optimize their engineering plans over the years to develop as much power as is feasible, is contrasted with the behaviour of the organizations representing the native people of the area, first opposing the project but later giving up the aboriginal title to the land in exchange for some legally recognized rights, and subsequently making additional concessions from their established rights in exchange for various community benefits. It is argued that this process has been resulting in an incremental erosion of the land and resource base of the Cree Indian people.

AB  - Abstract. We examined the linkage between climate and interspecific plant interactions in New England salt marshes. Because harsh edaphic conditions in marshes can be ameliorated by neighboring plants, plant neighbors can have net competitive or facilitative interactions, depending on ambient physical stresses. In particular, high soil salinities, which are largely controlled by solar radiation and the evaporation of marsh porewater, can be ameliorated by plant neighbors under stressful conditions leading to facilitative interactions. Under less stressful edaphic conditions, these same neighbors may be competitors. In this paper, we use this mechanistic understanding of marsh plant interactions to examine the hypothesis that latitudinal and inter-annual variation in climate can influence the nature and strength of marsh plant species interactions. We quantified the relationship between climate and species interactions by transplanting marsh plants into ambient vegetation and unvegetated bare patches at sites north and south of Cape Cod, a major biogeographic barrier on the east coast of North America. We hypothesized that the cooler climate north of Cape Cod would lead to fewer positive interactions among marsh plants. We found both latitudinal and inter-annual variation in the neighbor relations of marsh plants that paralleled latitudinal differences in temperature and salinity. South of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions tended to be more facilitative, whereas north of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions were more competitive. At all sites, soil salinity increased and plant neighbor interactions were more facilitative in warmer versus cooler years. Our results show that interspecific interactions can be strikingly linked to climate, but also reveal that because the sensitivity of specific species interactions to climatic variation is highly variable, predicting how entire communities will respond to climate change will be difficult, even in relatively simple, well-studied systems.

AB  - The agar shake technique has been tested for the enumeration and isolation of bacteria involved in the anaerobic oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds. High numbers of colony forming units were observed from regions rich in sulphide, and the numbers of these forms were sometimes significantly correlated with the number of sulphate-reducing bacteria. The isolates could oxidise not only thiosulphate but also sulphide in liquid medium at the expense of nitrate. Addition of 1 mM glucose to the medium enhanced the rate and amount of thiosulphate oxidised by many of the isolates. Hence the use of the agar shake technique is recommended for the study of these little known facultatively or even obligately chemolithotrophic bacteria involved in the anaerobic oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds in the marine and estuarine environment.

AB  - This research aims to develop a concrete-like material for underwater construction applications by using fluorogypsum (FG, an industrial by-product of hydrofluoric acid production), class C fly ash, and type II Portland cement. Two Response Surface Models (RSMs) were derived based on compressive strength tests and expansion measurements on FG-based blend cylindrical samples after 28-day curing. The developed RSMs allow accurate prediction of the compressive strength and volumetric expansion as functions of the relative content in weight of different components in the FG-based blend material. Using these RSMs, a composition with promising strength and durability properties was identified. Additional mechanical and physical properties that are significant for structural applications were also investigated experimentally for this composition, confirming that the select composition could be a promising substitute for ordinary concrete and/or limestone. The effects of environmental actions on the mechanical and durability properties of the FG-based blend were investigated by immersing samples in seawater for a period of one year. The results of this experimental investigation suggest that the developed FG-based blend is a promising material for underwater applications (e.g., as oyster cultch) and coastal protection structures (e.g., for the construction of artificial reefs and breakwaters), at a significantly lower cost than other materials commonly used for the construction of these structures. Additionally, the unit weight of the proposed material is significantly lower than that of ordinary concrete and limestone, which contributes to a longer life span of the underwater structure by reducing its sinking rate into the soft soil typically found, e.g., in the US Gulf Coast region. © 2017 Marine Technology Society.

AB  - Two causes of coastal erosion problems, onshore/offshore transport and gradients in longshore transport, are discussed, together with remedies for combating the erosion. Long term erosion problems occur due to littoral drift gradients, and by calculation of sediment transport capacities, defence structures can be designed. Sand suppletion methods are possibly better solutions than the construction of groynes, seawalls and breakwater since these devices merely transfer the erosion from one area to another. (A.J.)

AB  - <jats:p> Hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense), a parasitic seed plant, is endemic and common in coastal western hemlock forests from northern California to southern Alaska. The mistletoe spreads by seeds dispersed from residual to nearby trees. Over time, infestations can significantly reduce tree growth. Annual growth losses attributed to mistletoe infection are estimated at over 1 million m3 in coastal British Columbia. Variable retention silviculture regimes recently implemented in hemlock-dominated coastal forests create conditions that could exacerbate the spread, intensification, and effects of mistletoe.The Stand Establishment Decision Aid (SEDA) format has been used to extend information on various vegetation and forest health concerns in British Columbia. This is the second SEDA produced for the Coast Forest Region. It summarizes information that relates current management regimes to the spread and effects of hemlock dwarf mistletoe. The first page provides general information, hazard ratings for the biogeoclimatic zones and subzones of the Coast Forest Region, and silvicultural considerations for hemlock dwarf mistletoe. The second page outlines the growth and yield implications and other effects and associations of the pathogen. This page also includes a valuable resource and reference list to provide readers with more detailed information.

AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is increasingly being promoted as a cost-effective means of adaptation to climate change. However, in spite of considerable international press, there is still little evidence to substantiate this claim. This study proposes a method through which the cost-effectiveness of EbA strategies can be evaluated against alternative adaptation options, and contributes to South African literature on the subject. The potential cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration is assessed as a means of securing the carrying capacity of land for pastoralist communities of the Kamiesberg communal area in South Africa under projected future climate conditions. The conventional alternatives would be to respond to increasingly dry conditions by drilling boreholes and using supplemental feed for livestock. It was assumed that the EbA interventions would occur upfront, whereas the alternatives are more likely to be implemented in reaction to droughts over a longer time period. The study found the implementation of conventional alternatives to be more cost-effective than EbA as a means to sustaining livestock stocking rates, with EbA being twice as costly. However, this is framed from the perspective of those directly affected (the landowners), and does not include the benefits to broader society.

AB  - <jats:p>Throughout Florida’s history, humans have altered the coastlines, leading to large-scale degradation of coastal ecosystems. This has led to the loss of associated ecosystem services, including products such as food and timber, and processes like coastal protection and disease control. Unfortunately, ecosystem restoration efforts have not always been a priority for coastal management. This 10-page literature review surveys the available ecosystem-service valuation literature for five of Florida’s coastal natural communities—oyster reefs, beach dunes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes—to facilitate the quantification of ecosystem services to provide a better measure of the full impact of restoration efforts.

AB  - The XBeach model has been applied for different field sites, each having its specific problems. Cases were ranging from typical 1D beach erosion tests during storm conditions (to compare with Durosta results) which were extended to full 2D models to include the effects of curved coasts. For these kind of applications the XBeach model proved to be at least as good as Durosta for the 1D cases, but also giving the opportunity to include the 2D effects. Other examples are situated on high energy coasts (with long swell waves). Applications there are for example the design of a new coastal protection scheme, but also the study of sedimentation patterns in a shallow harbour surrounded by breakwaters and beaches. XBeach proved to be a powerful tool to get insight into these complex situations.

AB  - The mesotidal coast of Huelva (S.W. Spain) is a tide-dominated (mixed energy) coastline type. This littoral zone is subject to a warm-temperate climate. Tidal regime is both mesotidal and semidiurnal with a slight diurnal inequality. The Piedras River mouth operates like an estuarine lagoon, where sediment supply is of dominantly marine provenance. Depositional facies along the inner estuary includes: (1) channel, (2) active channel margin, (3) salt marsh and (4) sterile marsh facies. All these facies are very similar to those described in other locations. Inner facies are associated along the estuary mouth with spit facies and related environments: beach and dunes. Three stages in recent evolution of Piedras Estuary have been distinguished. The estuary-mouth morphology has evolved from a barrier-island system into an elongated spit secretion due to a decrease of the tidal prism. Two processes have changed the tidal prism: (1) estuary filling and (2) dam construction.

AB  - Classic descriptive models of barrier sedimentation have been developed with data from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. These models are dominated by low to moderate rates of relative sea level (RSL) rise and wave energy. Barriers respond by landward recycling of sediment through the mechanism of shoreface retreat. Sedimentation processes on the central coast of New South Wales (N.S.W.), Australia, consist of rapid RSL rise in early Holocene times followed by a stillstand since 6500 B.P. Wave energy is relatively high year-round and sand sources for barrier formation are only found on the inner shelf. Barrier sedimentation on the central coast of N.S.W. exhibits a thick, composite sequence composed of a basal marine transgressive sand overlain by regressive beach and dune facies. The Louisiana coast surrounding the Mississippi delta is underlain by compacting deltaic muds which generate very rapid rates of RSL rise. The Louisiana coast experiences low wave energy punctuated by high-energy tropical and extra-tropical storm events. Barrier sediments accumulate from the erosion of deltaic headlands and undergo a transformation from subaerial barrier island systems to subaqueous shoals located on the inner shelf. Drumlins experience coastal erosion on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia and provide a sediment source for compartmented estuary mouth barriers. An ongoing, moderate rise of RSL results from the passage of a glacial forebulge. Wave energy is intermediate between Louisiana and N.S.W. and displays a seasonal pattern dominated by frequent winter storms. Coastal barrier sedimentation is episodic, consisting of a period of beach ridge progradation followed by barrier destruction and re-establishment further landward. The three contrasting sedimentary sequences found in examples from Louisiana, N.S.W. and Nova Scotia indicate that presently available sedimentation models from locations such as the middle Atlantic or Texas coasts of the United States may only represent well-documented regional case studies. A true generalised coastal sedimentation model is required which can identify the parameters controlling vertical and horizontal translation of the depositional surface and provide relationships between these parameters which quantitatively predict the genesis, distribution and geometry of coastal sedimentary facies. © 1984.

AB  - <jats:p><p>Larger and more devastating flood events are happening more frequently across the planet, but flooding is a natural occurrence for any river system. It is only due to human modification of the river system, through the removal of natural features and attempts at flood control, that creates flood hazards that cause damage to communities and ecosystems.  Kapiti Coast’s terrain consisted, pre 19th century, of a mixture of dense coastal forests and extensive wetlands. The landscape has and always will be prone to flooding. With the addition of the expressway to the region, making it easier to travel to and from the capital Wellington, it is expected that the population of Kapiti will grow. But biodiversity may get lost, and flooding may become increasingly more frequent. How might new settlers learn to live with flooding and the constant risk that every time it rains it may cause damage to their homes or businesses? Can there be other benefits to floodplain management, such as biodiversity and recreation?  The aim of this research is to investigate and develop strategies to aid in the settlement of floodplains so that biodiversity is improved, allowing people to live with floods and without the fear that flooding may cause damage. Specifically, the design-led research seeks to generate solutions that improve both flood awareness and flood protection along the Waikanae River. The design seeks to allow the river to express its own flow patterns, and then secondly, how settlement will work within that. It can then be a catalyst for settlement of floodplain areas along the edge of the river.  This thesis will explore how ecology, rehabilitation and natural flood protection can be employed amongst an expanding urban context to create a new way of thinking about our rivers and mitigating the ever pressing issue of flooding.</p></jats:p>

AB  - This paper illustrates a budget approach to investigate and manage littoral sediment for coastal defence within an integrated process system in west Dorset, England. The budget is quantified in terms of inputs, transfers, storage and outputs of sediment within a littoral cell. Complex, long established links are demonstrated between eroding cliff sediment sources and a sequence of pocket shingle beaches that they supply. Sediment inputs and subsequent transfers are found to be episodic so that the beaches naturally alternate between open and closed system states according to prevailing transport conditions. Interestingly, the major storm barrier of Chesil Beach is identified as the ultimate shingle sink. These results suggest that the beach did not simply develop as a product of the Holocene transgression as often envisioned, but until recently, it formed part of a larger natural process system with the periodic input of additional shingle from the west, derived from the erosion of massive unstable cliffs. However, several interventions have dislocated these natural linkages, unwittingly reinforcing the closed system states. In the absence of natural replenishment, the modified beaches are becoming increasingly sensitive to the continuing relative sea-level rise and storm activity that characterises this region. Attention is drawn to the need to establish such understanding prior to undertaking additional interventions. Details are provided of the ways in which this information has assisted in the control of beach mining and future management policies are suggested.

AB  - The 'Working with Nature' philosophy (PIANC, 2011) was developed to apply to the planning of new navigation infrastructure projects. This case study illustrates how elements of the philosophy can be applied to ongoing activities such as maintenance dredging. For many years, most of the material dredged by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) from the docks, river entrances and approach channel to the Port of Liverpool has been taken to an offshore licensed disposal site. Much of the remainder has been deposited closer to the Port, within the estuary. MDHC's maintenance dredging and disposal regime has been assessed and shown to be compliant with both the EU Habitats Directive and the EU Water Framework Directive. No adverse environmental effects have been identified. Notwithstanding this compliance, several factors including potential cost and carbon savings led to MDHC organising a stakeholder meeting at the end of 2011 to discuss whether opportunities might exist to use the maintenance dredged materials beneficially - whether for environmental or engineering purposes. This initiative represented a significant departure from 'the norm' for MDHC who, in common with most other UK harbour authorities, have powers under their Local Act to carry out maintenance dredging, and regard such activities as 'internal' matters. It also represented a challenge for the stakeholder organisations as this was not a capital development project requiring compensation - a situation in which such organisations often 'call the shots' - but rather a voluntary initiative, the success of which would depend on collaboration, cooperation and compromise. This paper elaborates on the background to, and presents progress to date with, the Mersey sediment management study as it moves from option identification and assessment to implementation - based on the principles of Working with Nature and adaptive management. © 2013 WODA.

AB  - In England about 5 million properties are at risk of flooding. Socio-economic growth, rising sea levels and extreme weather will exacerbate this issue in the next 100 years. Building coastal resilience is vital worldwide to save people from the impact of flooding and the costs of damage and insurance. In Australia the use of mussel reefs and mangrove forests combined with man-made structures are being trialed to see how well they protect shorelines. Ways to measure the evolving effectiveness of nature-based hazard management are now required to determine the cost-benefit over various management epochs. Using capacitance-wire technology we have developed innovative systems to measure the required field data: overtopping, wave, water level and inundation conditions at the land-sea interface.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9IpZpOPW3I&feature=youtu.be</jats:p>

AB  - Coral reefs provide critical ecological and geomorphic (e.g. sediment production for reef-fronted shoreline maintenance) services, which interact in complex and dynamic ways. These services are under threat from climate change, requiring dynamic modelling approaches that predict how reef systems will respond to different future climate scenarios. Carbonate budgets, which estimate net reef calcium carbonate production, provide a comprehensive 'snap-shot' assessment of reef accretionary potential and reef stability. These budgets, however, were not intended to account for the full suite of processes that maintain coral reef services or to provide predictive capacity on longer timescales (decadal to centennial). To respond to the dual challenges of enhancing carbonate budget assessments and advancing their predictive capacity, we applied a novel model elicitation and review method to create a qualitative geo-ecological carbonate reef system model that links geomorphic, ecological and physical processes. Our approach conceptualizes relationships between net carbonate production, sediment transport and landform stability, and rates knowledge confidence to reveal major knowledge gaps and critical future research pathways. The model provides a blueprint for future coral reef research that aims to quantify net carbonate production and sediment dynamics, improving our capacity to predict responses of reefs and reef-fronted shorelines to future climate change. © 2021 CRC Press.

AB  - Algal blooms are becoming increasingly common within the Chesapeake Bay. Nutrients entering the Bay, combined with optimal physical conditions and light, temperature and rainfall, contribute to the formation of these blooms. Certain types of phytoplankton (eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria) in these accumulations cause problems in local waters, including discolored water, noxious odors and taste, and poor food for Zooplankton, benthos, and fish. Some are toxic and may also cause hypoxia/anoxia, with the low oxygen stressful to fish and other aquatic life. Submerged aquatic vegetation can also be adversely affected by the light-scattering cells. Because of increasing concern over the effects of algal blooms on organisms in Chesapeake Bay, laboratory studies were undertaken to examine the potential for removal of phytoplankton from the water column by the addition of kaolin clay as clay has been successfully used in Asia to remove established blooms. Three bloom-forming phytoplanktors were used as test organisms: Prorocentrum minimum, a dinoflagellate common to the Bay which often forms large mahogany tides and can cause oyster mortality; Chattonella subsalsa, a rhaphidophyte observed in the coastal bays of Maryland and Delaware that has been associated with fish kills due to resulting low dissolved oxygen; and a small cyanobacterium from the Patuxent River similar to bloom species in nutrient-rich tributaries of the Bay. The experiments compared phytoplankton in media with and without clay slurry additions. In vivo fluorescence (IVF), an indicator of the amount of the plant pigment chlorophyll present, was measured on each of 4 replicates for each phytoplankton taxon (control and treated) before clay additions, 2.5 hours after clay addition, and 4 days later. Results showed a significant decrease in IVF in all clay treatments. Largest reductions in IVF were noted in Prorocentrum and Chattonella (99% and 92%, respectively). Single factor ANOVA indicated that significant decreases (p<0.001) occurred after the initial 2.5 hour incubation period. Four days later, there was no further decline in IVF (p>0.05). For the cyanobacterium, two experiments were conducted, one with very high densities typical of laboratory cultures, and a second with lower levels closer to those found in summer Chesapeake Bay waters. At 2.5 hours and 4 days, the IVF of the clay-treated cyanobacterium had decreased significantly (p<0.001). These results indicate the almost complete aggregation and removal of Prorocentrum and Chattonella from the water column with the added clay while the cyanobactium (initially >100 times more dense) remained in suspension longer and was removed by flocculation with the clay through time. The results of the current study suggest that the use of clays in controlling algal blooms looks promising for routine use in many estuaries. As clays are important and common constituents of most soils in coastal plains adjacent to these systems, the control material could be readily available in most basins for routine stripping of phytoplankton blooms from surface waters. Future work includes examination of natural soils as an efficient strategy for inexpensive control of recurring blooms in the Chesapeake Bay and nearby coastal bays.

AB  - It is common for the local sea state in coastal waters to be a complex combination of waves due to local and recent wind (the “sea”) and long period waves resulting from earlier weather systems, which have travelled many 100s of km with little attenuation of these very long waves (the “swell”). Sea and swell may have very different directions and periods. The CrossOver project was born out of the recognition that there is an absence of guidance on the influence of directionally bimodal (or bidirectional, or ‘crossing’) seas on wave overtopping at a coastal defence. Through a physical model study carried out in the Delta Basin, the “CrossOver” project is beginning to fill this gap in the knowledge.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1224 - 2337. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 This paper analyses coastal erosion prevention measures carried out in Latvia. The foreseen global climate change impacts and the ever growing human load on the coastal areas along with the lack of erosion policy is bring up serious concern about safety and sustainability of Latvian coastline. Although no national policy regarding coastal erosion prevention is applied in Latvia, some coastal protection measures are applied by local municipalities and private landowners. There are in total around 34 coast protection structures on the coastline of Latvia. The protected area doesn't exceed 2 km in total. Most of the coastal defences are based on natural materials like greenery, stones and timber. There is no preliminary estimation of primary needs and mandatory funding for maintenance costs. The alternate criteria for economically based solution should be defined for long term period. Therefore principles of sustainable development require the using of economically based solution and criteria which shall be established in national level. The main task is the assignment of coefficients for appropriate economical appraisal due to investments of existing infrastructure and recreation zones. The general conclusion is that, despite many of the different laws and planning documents, especially the guidelines and management plans; any of coastal planning activities must be approved by governmental budget and should take into account the principles of economically based solutions.

AB  - A method for the design and safety assessment of coastal protection structures along the German Baltic Sea coast is developed based on an estimation of extreme storm impacts. About 60 meteorological storm scenarios and the reconstructed wind fields of the reference storm event of 1872 were used to drive a hydrodynamic modelling system covering the entire Baltic Sea. Water levels and wave climates were determined along the entire German Baltic Sea coastline and high-resolution profile models were applied to estimate local morphological impacts and maximum wave run-up for all storms. Depending on the locally-relevant type of load, it is possible to compare the time series of energy impact or wave run-up between scenarios and the reference event and to determine the maximum load. This method permits both the design of new and the safety assessment of existing structures. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - North American and northern European evidence suggests present infilling of estuaries with marine sediment as sea level has continued to rise. Along the New South Wales coast such infilling mainly has ended because sea levels have been stable since 6500 B.P. Bathymetric changes for the period 1868-1974 in three estuaries on the central coast of New South Wales show considerable contrast due to varying estuarine dynamics and sediment availability. Changes in Botany Bay have now stabilized or tended towards slight erosion (- 1332-1547 cm3 m-2 year-1) while changes within Port Jackson seaward of Bradley's Head (-7694 cm3 m-2 year-1) can be linked to dredging activities this century. In Broken Bay, substantial accretion has occurred at the ocean entrance (7684 cm3 m-2 year-1) and around Brisk Bay (5430 cm3 m-2 year-1). The former accretion can be attributed to movement of sediment landward of the 20-m contour under waves characteristic of the present wave regime, and to availability of sediment from adjacent semi-compartmentalized beaches. Such sediment movement and reservoirs do not exist at nearly as large a scale at the mouths of the other two Sydney estuaries. The latter accretion is coincident with the boundaries of marine sand intrusion up the estuary and of fluvial transport seawards. Because bathymetric change in areas of Broken Bay affected by ocean swell can be linked to wave hydrodynamics, changes in the wave climate such as increased storminess can lead to general bottom erosion. Such changes can also exacerbate erosion within Port Jackson and Botany Bay.

AB  - In 2008 the authors investigated the performances of a coastal defense project to be built along the NW coast of Sicily (Italy, Calabrese et a/., 2011). The intervention consists of shore parallel breakwaters armored with a relatively new eco-friendly system: ECOPODE (TM). In that context the idea arose of conducting an exhaustive experimental investigation on the "hydraulic response" of these units, including wave run-up, wave overtopping, wave transmission and wave reflection observations. The latter has been performed in 2010 at the LlnC Laboratory of University of Naples "Federico II". In this paper results on wave run-up and reflection are presented and discussed.

AB  - A succession of continental red beds in the Paleogene Carroza Formation, northeastern Mexico, contains an assemblage of evaporite paleosols previously unknown in pre-Neogene strata that record the syndepositional exposure of nearby diapiric evaporite and a climatic shift to increasing aridity. Carroza red beds were deposited in an ephemeral braided-fluvial system in a high-accommodation setting. Paleosols developed in nearly all depositional settings, including channels, crevasse splays, and floodplains, and contain salic/natric, gypsic, baritic, and calcic horizons. Calcic paleosols are limited stratigraphically to the lowermost part of the formation in oyster-bearing estuarine strata and yield upsection to evaporitic paleosols, thus providing a record of increasingly arid conditions as the Paleogene marine shoreline shifted eastward, toward the Gulf of Mexico Basin. The increase in aridity reduced vegetation and residuum thickness on the exposed diapiric salt, consequently increasing the influx of evaporitic minerals into the basin, and driving the development of salic/natric, gypsic, and baritic horizons in all depositional environments. Evaporitic paleosols of the Carroza Formation have characteristics similar to soils forming today in climates with annual precipitation ranging from <80 mm/yr to as much as 450 mm/yr, in apparent conflict with estimates of subhumid to subtropical conditions from Carroza fossil leaf data. Because evaporitic paleosols are persistent throughout the Carroza section, we infer that a combination of spring-fed, high water tables, augmented by flood-basin inundation from high-discharge seasonal fluvial flood events sustained perennial woodlands, and sodium-caused clay dispersion created poor drainage in topographically low parts of a rapidly subsiding salt-withdrawal basin.

They confirm that a stable margin will be approximately at mean sea level but that erosion, accretion or other disturbance may cause variation of the order of plus or minus 1 m. Studies in four species-rich rivers in north Queensland show that (i) there are marked distributional differences with respect to topographic height between long and short river estuaries, these differences being attributable to different tidal patterns; and (ii) there appear to be two mangrove types: the frontal species are tolerant of inundation, poorly adapted to emersion, whereas the upstream species behave as dry-land plants tolerant of only limited inundation. The topographic height range of individual plants of a single species may be almost 4 m, so that observations on individual plants are of little value.

AB  - Question: What are the effects of grazing abandonment on the vegetation composition of Estonian coastal wetlands? Location: Vormsi Island and Silma Nature Reserve in western Estonia, Europe. Methods: Local knowledge and field reconnaissance were used to identify current and historical management levels of wetland sites within the west Estonian study area. Nine study sites, with varying management histories, were selected comprising an area of 287 ha. A total of 198 quadrats were taken from 43 distinct vegetation patches in five of the sites. TWINSPAN analysis was used to identify community type, and a phytosociological key was constructed for character taxa. This vegetation classification was then applied within a GIS‐based context to classify all the study sites, using a ground survey technique and 1:2000 scale air photos. Results: We identified 11 different brackish coastal wetland community types. Indicator species were defined with community characteristics for the seven main vegetation types readily recognisable in the field. Coastal wet grasslands were most extensive in grazed sites, or sites that had been more intensively grazed, while abandoned sites were largely composed of Phragmites australis stands, tall grassland, and scrub. Site variations based on vegetation composition were significantly correlated with past grazing intensity. Plant community types showed significant edaphic differences, with particularly low soil moisture and high conductivity and pH for open pioneer patches compared to other vegetation types. Conclusion: Abandonment of traditionally grazed coastal grasslands threatens their characteristic biodiversity. This study found that grazing abandonment reduced the extent of coastal wetland grasslands of particular conservation value. Nevertheless, plant species of conservation interest were found across the sequence of community types described. The study shows that grazing is an important factor influencing coastal wetland plant communities but suggests that vegetation distribution is affected by environmental variables, such as topography.

AB  - Neptunium is present in the environment from a number of nuclear related sources and due to its presence in High, Intermediate and Low Level wastes, long half-life (t½ =2.13 × 106 y), availability, high radiotoxicity and secondary source from ingrowth of 241Am (t½ =432.6 y, α) and 241Pu (t½ =14.33 y, β-) is a major component of the dose commitment to the public. It is highly mobile in the environment and readily absorbed by man therefore radiologically significant especially for longer term waste management and safety case assessments. Due to difficulties with analysis there have been limited studies of the behaviour of neptunium in the environment required to understand the impact of its mobility and distribution; important when considering the burial and storage of nuclear waste. A review of cited methods showed most were based on the analysis of 237Np in a specific sample matrix. As the nuclear industry in the UK moves towards decommissioning phase, there is an increased demand for the analysis of more complex and varied samples types. In this study a method of the determination of 237Np was developed which was capable of analysing a wide variety of sample matrices. During the development phase, the lack of reference materials, especially for 237Np in solid matrices, became evident and to overcome a novel approach was developed using experimental design with the method scope based on elemental composition rather than sample type, increasing the flexibility of the method. Since 1952 authorised releases of many fission products and transuranic radioisotopes, including 237Np, have been discharged into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield nuclear site. The radionuclides become attached, dependent on particle reactivity, to sedimentary particles and incorporated by sedimentary deposition and suspension processes into intertidal and estuarine environments resulting in the contamination of the surrounding environment. Parallel to the coastline is an area of fine-grain size dominated sediments commonly known as the ‘mud patch’ where sedimentary particles, with associated radionuclides, accumulate as a result of tidal movement and currents in the shallow Western Irish Sea basin. Particulates are redistributed and deposited onto the saltmarsh as a result of tidal processes and storm events. Ravenglass saltmarsh is a highly dynamic ecosystem situated in the mouth of the River Esk, 5 km from Sellafield site. Like other saltmarsh environments, sediment both rapidly accumulates and degrades due to perturbations in sea level and storm events retaining a chronological profile of radionuclide discharge history. Research has shown that the Ravenglass saltmarsh is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas within the Irish Sea due to the significant levels of radionuclides, accumulated during tidal processes. The developed method was used to analyse surface scrape samples taken over a twenty five year period and an intertidal marsh sediment core from Ravenglass saltmarsh to gain a greater understanding of the behaviour, distribution and mobility of 237Np in the environment. Surface scrape samples provide a pragmatic method of measuring sediment contamination over large areas. The approach is used by most routine environmental monitoring programs, with the results used to calculate dose transfer factors and ascertain risk of exposure to the general public. The samples indicate recent contamination and are used in this study to identify temporal and spatial distribution across the saltmarsh. Samples from across the saltmarsh were analysed for a range of radionuclides (106Ru, 137Cs, Pu alpha, 237Np and 241Am) at four time points over the twenty five years. The greatest rate of change was reported for 106Ru, 137Cs and 237Np followed by Pu alpha and 241Am with a number of factors influencing the rate of reduction with time such as radiological half-lives, decreasing discharges and remobilisation. Considerable spatial variation for the different radionuclides across the saltmarsh was also observed, which with time became le s defined. The highest activity concentrations of long-lived radionuclides were in low energy areas, typically where higher rates of sedimentation and vegetation occurred. The trend was reversed for the shorter-lived radionuclide, 106Ru, with higher activity concentrations observed in high energy areas where there was frequent tidal inundation. The variation shows the importance of sampling from the exact same location for long term studies to ensure any changes in data are not an artefact of spatial variation but reflect temporal trends. The radionuclide profile of 237Np was determined in a sediment core taken from the saltmarsh which had a distinct geochemical redox profile. The core had been previously analysed for other radionuclides (137Cs, 241Am and Pu α) showed a chronological profile which had a strong correlation with published Sellafield discharge records indicating that the sediment was largely undisturbed. The highest activities of 237Np were in the upper sections of the profile with the presence of two minor peaks further down and activities decreasing to below the limit of detection at a depth of 21.5 cm. The profile was partially reconciled with the Sellafield effluent discharges however less defined than for other radionuclides. The lack of correlation was due to limited discharge data, increased 237Np activities in the upper sections and a differing profile distribution compared to the other transuranic nuclides possibly indicating redistribution of Np within the core. The distribution profile was consistent with other cores sampled at the Ravenglass saltmarsh which did not show redox zonation indicating 237Np is not redox sensitive in this environment. Comparison of nuclide ratios in the surface scrape and core concluded 237Np exhibited conservative behaviour, similar to 137Cs, and activities closely reflecting Sellafield discharges due to the lower affinity for inorganic particles. This was in contrast to Pu alpha which exhibited a higher affinity for inorganic particles becoming strongly associated with the fine grained sediment and exhibiting non-conservative behaviour with input sources originating from discharge and the mud patch with results reflecting both current and historic contamination. Such information is essential in assessing the long-term behaviour of 237Np in the environment, importance in radiological dose assessment and mobility and distribution in long term storage options such as geological disposal.

AB  - Previous research shows that storm surge episodes occur frequently at the mouth of the Tagus Estuary, causing important water level anomalies in Lisbon and Cascais tide gauge records and having important effects in coastal erosion. Atmospheric pressure is indicated as the main driver of storm surge events in the West Iberian Peninsula. In this article, a set of tide gauge records, between October 1972 to January 1973, for 11 locations in the Tagus Estuary and adjacent coast and a numerical model of Tagus Estuary hydrodynamics are used to test the importance of large scale atmospheric pressure changes in explaining inner estuary non-tidal water level anomalies with period larger than 30 hours. This research finds that the account of atmospheric pressure can reduce the importance of the model centered RMSE in 5-20% and improve considerably the model results correlation coefficient in the lower and middle estuary, particularly in low depth locations not directly affected by river discharges.

AB  - The Philippine archipelago, which has one of the longest coastlines in the world, will not be spared of the adverse impacts of sea-level rise and extreme climate events that are expected to happen in a warmer world. This study aims to review climate change impacts on Philippine coastal communities and to set directions for possible adaptation measures on both local and national levels. The erratic changes in the climate system have affected various coastal ecosystem and communities. Among which coral bleaching, changes in productivity, changes in plankton dynamics, alterations in seagrass and sea weed reproduction patterns, shoreline erosion and retreat, changes in trophic dynamics as well as aggravation of marine diseases are just a few. Apparently, the most significant impact is on coastal fisheries yield and community welfare. Existing climate change initiatives in the country include Integrated Coastal Zone Management System (ICZM), coastal policies and regulations (e.g. Fisheries Code), disaster management strategies among others. However, there is lack of integration for these initiatives in the context of climate change. Several points were raised as suggestions and solutions. An improved network of strategies should be created and a multi-sectoral approach should be adapted. Macro and micro-level adaptation measures should be defined and evaluated to ensure effective dissemination and implementation. The national government embodies the authority for governance and policies. On the other hand, local government should focus on implementation in collaboration with the academe (technical support), non-government organizations (advocacy, information, education and communication), private, and financial institutions (financial assistance). Recent observations on climate change impacts are sufficient evidence to raise this issue as a national concern. Recognizing and accepting that climate is indeed altering the planet is crucial and a change of mindset should begin within us.

AB  - Current conventional wisdom argues that human-induced excesses in nutrient loadings to estuaries often stimulate 'excess' algal production leading to hypoxia, via bacterial pathways, and subsequent reduced recruitment/survival of finfish and shellfish. Why wouldn't such elevated production stimulate more animal production, rather than less? In a three-year study of Long Island Sound, U.S.A., a multitude of variables were quantified along a west to east gradient, to address the above question via the hypothesis that different successes among planktonic species experiencing eutrophication alter planktonic food web structure away from traditional pathways to microbial loop dominated ones. Variables studied included: nutrient concentrations and ratios (i.e. NO2, NO3, NH4, DON, PON, PO4, Silicate, N/P and N/Si), phytoplankton, protozooplanktonic ciliate, zooplankton, heterotrophic nanoplankton (HNAN), photosynthetic nanoplankton (PNAN), size-fractionated chlorophyll, larval fish and bacterial concentrations and/or species composition, and bacterial growth rates (as frequency of dividing cells, FDC). Results indicated that although current nitrogen and other nutrient loadings into the estuary are much higher than past inputs (especially in western waters), the average concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients is similar (though slightly higher) to past values. Relative proportioning among chemical species does vary from west to east, with NH4 and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) at times more prevalent in the west, especially in bottom waters. Excess loadings of nitrogen and other nutrients into the estuary are converted to elevated biomass of both small (<10 μm), and large (>20 μm) phytoplankton in the west. Slightly enhanced bacterial densities and growth rates shadow the elevated chlorophyll levels, with distinctive Sound-wide seasonal patterns that follow not total chlorophyll, but rather PNAN concentrations. HNAN concentrations also are elevated in the west, and likely influence bacterial dynamics. Species composition of phytoplankton routinely differ west to east. Inorganic N/P are routinely low (i.e. below Redfield ratios), especially in the west, while total dissolved N/P (i.e. including DON) are similar among stations and typically are significantly higher than Redfield ratios. Associated with bacterial and <10 -m chlorophyll enhancements to an elevated diversity of ciliate species in the west. Copepod biomass is extremely enhanced in the west, indicating that while stimulating the microbial loop, eutrophication is also enhancing the secondary production preferred by larval fish and gelatinous zooplankton. Larval fish diversity is down relative to the past, but shows little contemporaneous west/east variations. So, if adult fish populations are down, but larvae are not food limited, possibly toxicity, overfishing, and/or habitat destruction which prevent a healthy, normal system response to eutrophication are culpable. It is suggested that recipients of the excess copepod production are likely gelatinous zooplankton and benthic sediments, and that unused copepod 'excess' biomass likely significantly contributes to hypoxia.

AB  - There is little unanimity concerning the environmental modifications potentially forced by the acceleration of global climate change in the coming century, or the future actions required to work towards a sustainable development of natural habitats in the coastal zone. A simple framework to assess the potential implications of flooding in fetch-limited coastal environments (with no relevant wave setup), experiencing both coastal and river flooding, was recently developed. It identifies tide, storm surge, sea level rise and river discharge as the main sources of flooding hazards. Hazard maps differentiate distinctive zones of flooding: the constantly flooded zone, the frequently flooded zone, and the infrequently flooded zone. The framework prioritizes site-based local management, and identifies alternative tools for sustainable coastal resources, to face non-desired flood effects. It was applied to a morphologically complex (tidal channels network, salt marshes, dunes) occupied backbarrier coastal stretch located in Culatra Island, South Portugal (max. fetch ∼ 4 km). The obtained inundation levels predicted for 1, 10 and 100 year-return periods were 2.02 m, 2.39 m, and 2.84 m above MSL, respectively. The high-, moderate-, and low-risk zones include about 34 m2, 1, 073 m2 and 31, 821 m2 of occupied area, respectively. Besides houses, flood impacts also affect other infrastructures (e.g., walkways and recreational structures). Several best practices principles and guidelines were proposed for the three risk zones, namely the adaptation to uses with 'added value', which enhances the local ecological values and strengths economic activities. This study contributes to the method validation at a complex morphological area and enriches the understanding about the potential of flood in fetch-limited conditions, praising the perspective of 'living with climate change'. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Over the past half century, habitat changes have significantly affected production of northern pike (Esox lucius), especially in the Great Lakes Basin. Loss of wetlands, reduction of shoreline cover and structure, cultural eutrophication, and siltation have negatively affected water transparency, abundance of macrophyte habitat, and even body condition. We review recent habitat restoration programs conducted in the Great Lakes Basin to reverse this trend. However, assessment has usually been inadequate to evaluate their success. Spawning and nursery requirements (first year of life) are examined, using a system for classifying and ranking major physical characteristics and requirements. Depth of nursery habitat is directly correlated with fish size and age. Spawning habitat is usually less critical or limiting but more easily manipulated and restored than nursery or juvenile-adult habitats. Year-class strength over 22 yr in eastern Lake Ontario was correlated positively with midsummer temperature and negatively with late summer-early fall water elevation; also, the largest year-class appeared immediately after catastrophic winterkill of a predator, white perch (Morone americana). Both implicate nursery rather than spawning associations. Adult abundance is related to the extent of macrophyte cover, which is optimal from 35 to 80% but inversely related to body size.

AB  - The following article describes three case studies where Effective Microorganisms (EM) proved to be successful at recovering natural aquatic ecosystems as well as treating sewage and industrial waste water. The first case was at a water treatment plant that received the sewage water from two populated sectors of about 1'100,000 people within Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador. The efficacy of EM treatment was compared to an already established water treatment system using electrical aerators. In both cases, pH was maintained at a neutral range after 8 weeks and hydrogen sulfide, main cause of foul odors, was not detected after 5 weeks. The most significant difference was in the cost and used of energy. The second case consisted of treating the facilities of a slaughterhouse processing 1000 animals a day with the objective of reducing foul odors. EM was sprayed in all areas of the facility including floors, pathways, sewers and surrounding areas. Although no measurable parameters were evaluated, workers were interviewed to determine efficacy in reducing foul odors. After 5 months of treatment, employees and foremen agreed that foul odors were reduced almost completely to the point that employees did not feel the need to use masks. In addition, there was a consensus that the working conditions had significantly improved. The third case was the treatment of a natural estuary being contaminated with sewage water. Water samples and sediments were taken from the area receiving sewage water from the city sewage system. The following parameters were evaluated: Acidity, phosphates, organic matter, hydrogen sulfide, total suspended solids, populations of coliforms and salmonella. The results showed a significant decrease in phosphates, total suspended solids, organic matter and hydrogen sulfide, and a reduction in concentration of coliforms. Additionally, pH was maintained at neutral range allowing the proliferation of native life. These experiences demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of EM to mitigate water contamination due to human activities in populated cities. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - At Lake Whangape, Lower Waikato River, New Zealand, almost 14 km of the 29 km shoreline supports turf communities during late summer/early autumn. A 1997 survey discerned 21 community types of turfs, comprising both indigenous and alien species. Most turfs were highly diverse-44 indigenous and 91 alien plant species were reported from an area of 800 m2 of shoreline. Many species were ephemeral, either facultative or obligate annuals, colonising exposed sediments and dying once submerged. The critically endangered grass Amphibromus fluitans, found during 1990, now appears to be extinct here. The lake supports the largest known population of the indigenous annual sedge Fimbristylis velata. Regionally important populations of Pratia perpusilla and Carex gaudichaudiana are present. Cattle grazing and grass-selective herbicides were investigated by constructing cattle exclosures and monitoring vegetation changes inside and outside, over three years. Dominant species were usually perennials, with the alien Mercer grass (Paspalum distichum) and the indigenous emergent spike sedge (Eleocharts acuta) most common. There was no change in the abundance of turf species. The grass-specific herbicide Gallant® successfully controlled Mercer grass for at least one year. Factors controlling the distribution and composition of the turfs were minimum lake level and timing of drawdown, wave exposure, and the grazing impacts of cattle, waterfowl, and coarse fish. Weedy alien plants were not considered current threats. Cattle access to the lake is detrimental to the whole lake system, reducing plant cover, and preventing establishment of a nutrient buffer of marginal/emergent vegetation. Actions for managing the turf communities include: lowering the existing outlet structure (sill) giving more exposed surface for summer turf development; fencing larger areas of turf against cattle access, or attempting to prevent cattle access to the entire shoreline; monitor impact of waterfowl grazing; control expansion of willows and other weeds; trial fish exclosures for the impact on turfs; attempt restoration of amphibious communities around Plot 4.

AB  - Sebaea ovata (Labill.) R.Br., a critically endangered indigenous annual herb, was locally common in coastal lowlands and swampy ground in New Zealand. It is now only present as two small populations (Whitiau and Waitotara) in dune flats in the Wanganui Conservancy. The field population of S. ovata at Whitiau Scientific Reserve (New Zealand) and field sites in Australia were investigated. Cultivation and morphological and genetic comparisons of New Zealand and Australian plants were made to guide the management of S. ovata in New Zealand. At Whitiau, S. ovata is restricted to an area of c. 300 m2 with a total population of between 8757 plants (December 1998) and 641 plants (March 1999). Sediment core samples showed no evidence of an extensive seed bank. Soils were very low in available nitrogen compared to Waitotara. S. ovata requires open vegetation in which to establish and maintain its population. Winter flooding of the dune habitat excludes the more competitive perennial species. If flood events do not coincide with the life cycle of S. ovata, plants may be killed without contributing seed. A series of a typical seasons could lead to extinction, therefore the status of S. ovata in New Zealand is considered critical. The extinction of one or both populations is likely unless conservation management is undertaken. In southern mainland Australia, S. ovata occupies a different habitat. It occurs in open eucalypt forest amongst a diverse assemblage of native and introduced annual species which grow and reproduce in spring/early summer, influenced by seasonal rainfall. Differences in habitat and plant size have led to suggestions that S. ovata fron New Zealand and Australia may be different taxa. Glasshouse cultivation of plants from both countries, and morphological comparison (supported by ITS sequence data) indicate they are indeed the same species. Successful cultivation of S. ovata has been achieved. Cultivated plants and seed have been returned to the Department of Conservation for replanting and resowing. The maintenance of S. ovata in culture, as well as the protection of suitable S. ovata habitat are the key to ensuring the survival of the species in New Zealand.

AB  - On the North Sea and Channel shores the Southeastern coast of England holds perhaps the record for the number of towns gobbled up during recent -- historic -- times. The relative level of the sea to the land has varied over the centuries: in the late Roman period, and again from about 1250 onwards. Protective dykes were constructed but were repeatedly destroyed by the sea. There were periods of accretion that resulted for instance in the creation of the salt marshes of Essex and the Wash. Once flourishing settlements on the eastern coast of England have been completely destroyed, some before, some during the Middle Ages. Some prospering settlements disappeared under the sea in the 14th century, when major flooding occurred several times, with the worst floods in the 15th century. The coast of Flanders -- Belgian area and Netherlandish Zeeland -- has been the theatre of both silting and erosion. The paper provides a review of physical changes, loss of land, and economic consequences.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Tidal salt marshes are known to accumulate “blue carbon” at high rates relative to their surface area, which render these systems among the Earth's most efficient carbon (C) sinks. However, the potential for tidal salt marshes to mitigate global warming remains poorly constrained because of the lack of representative sampling of tidal marshes from around the globe, inadequate areal extent estimations, and inappropriate dating methods for accurately estimating C accumulation rates. Here we provide the first estimates of organic C storage and accumulation rates in salt marshes along the Pacific coast of Canada, within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, a region currently underrepresented in global compilations. Within the context of other sites from the Pacific coast of North America, these young Clayoquot Sound marshes have relatively low C stocks but are accumulating C at rates that are higher than the global average with pronounced differences between high and low marsh habitats. The average C stock calculated during the past 30 years is 54 ± 5 Mg C ha−1 (mean ± standard error), which accounts for 81 % of the C accumulated to the base of the marsh peat layer (67 ± 9 Mg C ha−1). The total C stock is just under one-third of previous global estimates of salt marsh C stocks, likely due to the shallow depth and young age of the marsh. In contrast, the average C accumulation rate (CAR) (184 ± 50 g C m−2 yr−1 to the base of the peat layer) is higher than both CARs from salt marshes along the Pacific coast (112 ± 12 g C m−2 yr−1) and global estimates (91 ± 7 g C m−2 yr−1). This difference was even more pronounced when we considered individual marsh zones: CARs were significantly greater in high marsh (303 ± 45 g C m−2 yr−1) compared to the low marsh sediments (63 ± 6 g C m−2 yr−1), an observation unique to Clayoquot Sound among NE Pacific coast marsh studies. We attribute low CARs in the low marsh zones to shallow-rooting vegetation, reduced terrestrial sediment inputs, negative relative sea level rise in the region, and enhanced erosional processes. Per hectare, CARs in Clayoquot Sound marsh soils are approximately 2–7 times greater than C uptake rates based on net ecosystem productivity in Canadian boreal forests, which highlights their potential importance as C reservoirs and the need to consider their C accumulation capacity as a climate mitigation co-benefit when conserving for other salt marsh ecosystem services. </jats:p>

AB  - The multidisciplinary research project "GIZCAM" began in January 2006 and will last 3 years, coordinating several research axes in order to promote Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It is scheduled to finalize a simulation model of the "Ile de Camargue" (Rhone Delta central area) hydrological functioning; to make it more modular in order to integrate new hydraulic management options, in normal (agricultural drainage) or critical (river floods and sea storms) situation. This tool is based in particular on data generated by a GIS, whose further implementation will lead to a control board of delta land use and ecosystems status. The evolution of coastline and bathymetric profiles in most sensible areas will be studied on a quantitative basis in relation with existing coastal defence structures and wave forcing. The results should allow suggesting alternative management options of the coastal area. Pesticides fluxes, from input on the delta drainage basin area, and salt fluxes at the sea interface, will be investigated, in order to estimate global transfer functions in the hydro system. Empirical sociological study will be conducted, focusing on understanding actions, decision making processes, and their impact on the functioning of the water executive commission. A role-playing game based on a Multi Agent simulation tool, will be used to assess negotiation processes while searching to establish sustainable management rules for coastal wetlands.

AB  - The "Ile de Camargue" is a complex hydrosystem, including agricultural drainage basins, marshes, and the brackish shallow Vaccarès lagoon system. This hydrosystem is particularly affected by water management and its endykement from the river and the sea. Decrease of sediment river input to the coast and sea level rise contribute to a global erosion of the shoreline. Within the endyked hydrosystem, during the rice cultivation period, large amounts of water are pumped from the river for irrigation, generating important water and sediment fluxes. Hydrosystem modelling and multi-source data are used to derive the suspended sediment balance and salt stock dynamics. Current water management and climate forcing will make it impossible to manage efficiently both water levels and salinity in the delta.

AB  - Saltmarsh grasses and mangrove trees have been recognized for their function in wave and current attenuation, which is fundamental in coastal protection with nature. In this study, we conducted in situ measurements on hydrodynamic mediation by three typical species of intertidal plants within three estuaries located in Southeast China, in order to examine the relative efficiency of different plants in protecting the coasts. Our field observations reveal that Scirpus mariqueter shows better efficiency than Spartina alterniflora in resistance to hydrodynamic forces, and the latter one is better than Kandelia obovate in protecting coasts.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chen, Y.; Huang, W., and Xu, S., 2014. Frequency analysis of extreme water levels in east and southeast coasts of China with analysis on effect of sea level rise. Qiantang bore as well as the storm surge are great disasters for river bank protection at the estuary of Qiantang River. Pearl River estuary is also frequently attacked by strong typhoon storm surge. The risk of damage from storm surge is expected to increase in both estuaries, exacerbated by sea level rise (SLR) and possible climate-induced increases in typhoon intensity and frequency. Adequate estimation on extreme water level will be essential to the coastal flood mitigation for both estuary areas with the effect of climate change. In this study, the popular frequency models Weibull, Lognormal, Gumbel, P-III and GEV are compared on Ganpu station located at the estuary of Qiantang River and Denglongshan station in Guangdong province, the optimal GEV model is recommended. For the risky analysis and management concern induced by the sho...

AB  - A comparative study at the global scale of ecological engineering techniques suitable for coral reef restoration.</jats:p> <jats:p>To limit the impact of development projects on the decline of coral ecosystem while following a trend already started in Europe and in the world ; the French regulation has, since 2009, made obligatory the establishment of initiatives to offset the impacts caused to the environment. Artificial reefs and coral transplantation (or both together) are the two tools providing the most positive experience feedbacks worldwide. The study and comparison of 22 restoration projects of coral reefs conducted worldwide has shown that since the new regulatory obligations of mitigation, European projects have been multiplied, trying to find more effective techniques at lower costs. However, despite undeniable advances in applied research on the effectiveness of ecological engineering techniques used in experimental conditions, there is still no standard methodology of evaluation for each case of their application, in the context of mitigation measures for environmental impacts. This methodological gap often results in a gap between the “scientific” and the “practical” restorations and by frequent disagreement on the best practices for evaluation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to present and evaluate the rate of biomass growth due to temperature changes and to identify the type of vegetation that best adapts to temperature changes in a surface flow constructed wetland (CW). The operation of the CW started in 2009 treating stream agricultural runoff from a watershed area of 221 ha which are mainly wet paddy fields. The CW is composed of seven connected cells which include a sedimentation zone, deep and shallow marshes. Five typical wetland plant species such as Acorus calamus, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites australis, Phragmites japonica, and Typha orientalis were planted surrounding the CW. The water quality and plant biomass were monitored from April to December 2009. The mean inflow DO and pH concentration were 6.9 ± 2.0 mg/l and 7.0 ± 0.5, respectively during the whole season. The water and air temperature at the CW were not significantly different (Ta = 0.86Taw; n = 15; r = 0.91; p <0.0001). Based on the results, the optimum temperature for the growth of vegetation was at 3400°C accumulated daily air temperature. The highest biomass rate was achieved during the summer season. Among the plants in the CW, the highest biomass rate (3.26 kg/m2) was exhibited by Typha orientalis. Relative growth rate (RGR) showed similar trend for each plant and the RGR values were highest between April and May. Findings indicated that flooding restricted the growth of most plants. In this newly CW, Typha orientalis and Phragmites australis were found to be the most suitable plants in the CW.

AB  - Choi K.H., Kim, Y.M., and Jung, P.M., 2013. Adverse effect of planting pine on coastal dunes, Korea. Forestation on the coastal dunes has been regarded as one of the best programs that help to stabilize the dune landscapes and protect the residential area from strong winds, blown sands, and salt spray. Introducing exotic species for dune stabilization was very common in the past. However, it could deprive coastal land of its ability to naturally recover, causing a retreat of coastline as well. As a typhoon passed through the Korean Peninsula early September in 2010, coastal dunes along the west coast of the peninsula were severely damaged during the storm. Some dunes retreated landward more after erosion, while others recovered their original profile through aeolian transport processes mainly in winter season. Vegetated dunes with pine trees recovered relatively less after the erosion than grass-covered dunes. Planting pine trees may interfere in these interactions, weakening natural recuperative power. We compared the characteristics of wind environment, morphology, and vegetation between the grass-covered dunes and the dunes covered with pine trees, for the purpose of the effectiveness of planting trees on dunes. The pine forest decreases the wind velocity on the front side of the dune to less than 50 of the grass-covered dune. Especially, the velocity of the strong winds faster than 4.5 m/s diminished to 25 of the control sites, resulting in decreased blown sand supply. Flora is also changed in the forested area. Terrestrial plants have invaded after pines were planted. In contrast, natural flora gets disappeared after the introduction of alien and exotic species. This study suggests that planting tree is likely to lead negative impact on coastal dunes. It may result in a retreat of coastline, loss of land, and devastation of dune ecosystems.

AB  - With the emergence of the so-called Blue Economy, various conservation finance mechanisms and financial structures are being proposed as a means of simultaneously securing marine biodiversity and profit-making A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance. While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits - ultimately rents - to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live.

AB  - A storm surge barrier is planned to build at the entrance of the North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary for various purposes, e.g. preventions of extreme high water level due to storm and salt intrusion in dry season. A process-based model of the Yangtze Estuary is elaborated to simulate water levels during typhoon period with the storm surge barrier included in the model as hydraulic structure. Scenarios for different storm surge barrier width are examined by the model. By applying real time control method, the storm surge barrier operation, such as gate opening and closing, is also implemented in the model. The simulated high water level during typhoon Winnie (9711) period with different opening width are compared with the reference case, i.e. without barrier, and the observation data. The width of 3km is recommended based on the largest reduction of extreme high water level. The optimal operation program during typhoon period is recommended.

AB  - A multi-objective, comprehensive technical evaluation was conducted in close coordination and consultation with state and other federal agencies to determine the nature and level of hurricane protection and environmental restoration that lines of defense provide for coastal Mississippi. The definition of "lines of defense" in this context means ways of protecting coastal Mississippi from hurricane inundation. The intended approach was to investigate plans and designs that provide increased hurricane protection for the Mississippi Gulf Coast as well as avoid and minimize unintended consequences of taking such actions. This paper focuses on the development of state-of-the-art atmospheric and coastal ocean hydrodynamic analysis methods that were used to determine the hurricane storm surge hazard along the Gulf Coast. These methods were developed as part of the Joint Coastal Surge Analysis Study in which the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency defined a unified technical approach to determine 100-yr storm water surface elevations across the region. Although other lines of defense were evaluated, the purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of flood protection structures on storm surge for storms of varying intensities and changes to the 100-yr flood elevations with flood walls in place. Nearly 200 synthetic storms were selected for simulation of the existing conditions along the Mississippi coast. Surge levels produced from these simulations populated the Joint Probability Method with Optimal Sampling (JPM-OS) surge response space and stage frequency curves were developed for 80 locations. By examining the actual surge responses from the simulated storms at a given location, the rank (which can be converted to return period) of the surge produced by each storm at that location was determined from the stage frequency curve. In this way, the range of return periods simulated for existing conditions could be covered for with-project (line of defense) conditions by applying the modeling system to a small subset of storms that span the full range of return periods, thus providing an efficient means to evaluate the lines of defense. The goal of this paper is to present an application of the JPM-OS by demonstrating how the Mississippi coast responds to different storms with and without lines of defense in place and how the lines of defense change stage frequency curves. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Observations in a mangrove lined coast in south-western Puerto Rico (rainfall 800-1,000 mm; evaporation 1,900-2,200 mm; mean annual temperature 25o C; and average tidal range 0.3 m) have shown that the degree of structural development of the mangrove forest is closely related to wave exposure. In exposed coastal segments, sand berms formed by wave action within the outer fringe prevent water flow towards the inner forest, resulting in high salinities. The berms are higher in areas where the outer mangrove fringe has been destroyed by storms or other causes. Dead mangrove stands are found behind these areas and salinities reach 75-80‰ We suggest that the mangrove fringe contributes to dissipate wave energy over a broad area which reduces the high of the berm. The presence of absence of "blowholes" in the seagrass Thalassia; bed is an index of the degree of protection that the coast receives. The "thickness" of the mangrove fringe is also related to the degree of shelter: it is "thin" in high energy segments, "thick" in coastal segments subject to intermediate energy and "thin"again in the most sheltered locations. In the outlying cays mangrove development follows a similar pattern: the outer exposed cays (essentially coral islands mantled by coarse sands) are devoid of mangrove cover or have stunted trees (generally Laguncularia; canopy height, 2 m). Islands which are less exposed are colonized by Rhizophora which frequently forms overwashed forests (canopy height, 8-9 m). In the most seltered areas, Rhizophora colonizes the shallow banks, forming islands which soon develop an inner hypersaline lagoon due to the accumulation of material in the outer edges and the accumulation of salt in the interior. The wave energy level reaching a given section of the coast is therefore an important factor which determines the degree of structural development of the mangrove forest. High energy levels are associated with erosion, destruction or deposition of berms which affect mangrove development. Low energy levels, however, are associated with a rapid process of island maturation, aging and death due to rapid salt accumulation.

AB  - At present, the entire Romanian shore of the Black Sea is intensely and continously damaged by sea erosion, on about 60-70 % of the shore length. The shoreline has moved onshore, on variable distances from an area to another, with values of up to tens meters, existing the risk to damage even the littoral bands. The erosion intensification is caused by the desechilibrium created by natural and artificial causes, between the quantity of available sediment in the littoral area, and the energy of waves and sea currents. In the last 5 decades, more than 50 breakwaters for beach protection have been realized in the area between Mangalia and Midia Head, especially in the areas of touristic importance, refering to the development of the littoral cities. Analysing these works, conclusions can be derived in order to improve their efficiency. For the littoral protection it is necessary to elaborate a program for stopping the shore erosions.

AB  - CIPRIANI, L.E., FERRI, S., LAMI, G and PRANZINI, E., 2011. Human Impact on Shoreline Evolution Along the Follonica Gulf (Southern Tuscany): How Tourism May Kill the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs. In: Micallef, A. (ed.), MCRR3-2010 Conference Proceedings, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue, No. 61, pp. 290–294. Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy, ISSN 0749-0208. Follonica Gulf beach is subject to widespread low-rate erosion, which started in the 19th Century due to river diversion for coastal marsh reclamation. Once rivers were re-directed to the coast; land subsidence induced by water extraction sustained erosion. From 1954 to 1984 mean shoreline retreat was approximately 9 m. In the 1960's, development of coastal tourism villages increased beach use and the need for house protection from storms. Detached breakwaters were built, trapping sand from adjacent coastal sectors. This induced shoreline progradation in protected sectors creating a wider beach, but unprotected coastal sectors experienced severe erosion. Stakeholders requested additional protection: the most developed area was gradually protected by detached breakwaters up to complete closure. Comparing the 2005 and 1954 shoreline positions, we see that out of the total length of approximately 21 km of coastline 8 km are accreting; less than 1 km is stable and over 12 km are eroding. Recently, a marina was built on the eastern margin of the study area; however wave diffraction at breakwater tip induced longshore transport and entrance siltation at the cost of western neighbouring beaches. Tourism industry stakeholders, whose economy is based on beach width and quality, were responsible for such coastal degradation, but now cooperate with local and regional administrations, accepting reduction in the use of hard defences - although shoreline realignment will end up penalising someone. Some detached breakwaters have been lowered to 50 cm below mean sea level, whereas others will undergo similar reshaping in the near future. The two oldest sets of coastal defence are now under study, in order to find solutions for a gradual return to more natural conditions. Changes to the marina configuration are being designed to prevent siltation, reaching a new equilibrium for the adjacent beach. We now realise that money spent for shore protection in some sectors would have maintained the 1950's shoreline position along the whole Gulf using beach nourishment, with no landscape deterioration.

AB  - This report assesses the impacts of the inclusion of two agricultural tracts, the exclusion of a marsh area, and the realignment of floodwall in conjunction with the Larose to Golden Meadow, Louisiana, hurricane protection project. The project is located in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, Wetland losses associated with the project were also reevaluated. The project provides for a hurricane protection levee from Larose to Golden Meadow. The levee would extend about 21 miles on the west bank and 22 miles on the east bank of Bayou Lafourche. The complete system would have a net evaluation of + 13.0 feet NGVD at Golden Meadow to + 9.5 feet at Larose.

AB  - In 1881 our forefathers had decided to build a sea-lock to ensure an always safe access for sea-going vessels of Emden-Port and to get a better protection against storm surges. The fairway, the lock and the new dykes were finished in 1888. At that time, the calculation level for the highest tides was set up to Chart Datum +6.00 m (means NN +4.50 m). The tidal range was nearly 3.00 m. The crown of the surrounding dykes was at NN +5.80 m. In 2006, more than a hundred years later, the sea-lock was still in operation. However since 1999 the Emden-port engineers are busy to find a solution for a renovation program with three main topics. To re-establish a safety against storm surge water levels by using the old geometry. To build a second mitre-gate in the outer lock head, which is able to withstand the water pressure at high water level? To ensure a lock operation for a period of 25 to 30 years, because in the ages of 2025 it will be necessary to reconstruct the main access lock to the port, the "Great Emden Sea-Lock". The concept was almost finished; the investment was calculated to nearly 18 Mio. €. But then came November 1rst 2006. The night brought the highest high water level the Dollart Estuary had ever seen. The highest high water level from March 1906 with NN +5.18 m for Emden rose up for about 30 cm to a new maximum level of NN +5.48 m. Similar differences were recorded in the Dutch ports of Delfzijl and Eemshaven. The lock planning group was surprised about this water level; the water overtopped the old gates and flew around the mitre gate hinges. The foreseen lock planning conference one day later at Nov. 2nd was held and a remarkable proposal was made. It is not longer acceptable to support a renovation concept, which doesn't bring more safety against raising water levels, which only aims at a longer operation of the sea-lock and which requires a very high amount of money. The raising sea-water level needs more attention to be paid to. The safety of some ten thousands of citizens must be considered and guaranteed. Because the satisfactory operation in Emden-Port cannot be achieved without a second smaller sea-lock it is impossible to close the Nesserland Sea-Lock. The lock must be renovated, but how?: A new outer lock-head with two roller-gates is to build seawards the old outer head. The lock-head and the sea-dike are to rise up by nearly 2.0 m to a height of NN +7.50 m. A new inner lock-head with a roller gate is to build also inwards the old inner head. The old lock chamber is to rebuild and be replaced by a new wider chamber. The lock entrance width and depth will be adjusted to modern coastal and inland vessels. The paper deals with the background of the first renovation concept and the discussion due to the approval authorities and the ministries for economic affairs and coastal protection about the necessity and the design water level after the November 1rst storm surge event. Some details about the approval procedure will be given and first results of the construction shall be presented. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The Svalbard breeding population of light-bellied brent geese which winters in Denmark and at Lindisfarne, England, changed distribution and habitat use within all six areas used during the 1980s and colonised two new areas during the late 1980s and one during the early 1990s. There appeared to be two major causes of these changes: (1) the reduction or even disappearance of Zostera beds in four of the traditionally used areas, due to increased eutrophication and probably also changes in sedimentation processes, following constructions of barrages at Manager Fjord and a causeway at Lindisfarne; and (2) the remaining beds of Zostera apparently have been depleted more rapidly in autumn and winter partly as a result of increased goose site use. In addition comes the cessation of cattle grazing and hay cutting of salt marshes in the formerly most important spring staging area. These changes have led to increased use of other areas and the establishment of three new areas of international importance for this brent goose population. The implications of the new patterns of dispersal are discussed in relation to future management of the areas used by the brent geese. Recommendations include improved management of salt marshes throughout their range and preparation of an international conservation plan.

AB  - This budget shows that the sandy beaches of Norfolk, Suffolk, and northernmost Essex depend on the erosion of cliffs for their sand supply, and enables us to relate beach volumes to the rate of littoral drift. Economical coastal defence works should aim at maintaining high beach levels, which will protect structures and also favour the very important tourist trade. At some (although by no means all) locations sand feeds are likely to be more economical than improved walls or revetments. -Authors

AB  - Cobell, Z.; Zhao, H.; Roberts, H.J.; Clark, F.R., and Zou, S., 2013. Surge and wave modeling for the Louisiana 2012 Coastal Master Plan. The goal of the study was to evaluate various coastal restoration and protection projects and the associated benefits for reductions in storm surge and wave height. Efforts in numerical modeling have been made to create a database of storm surge and wave responses to a set of hypothetical storms under current and various future conditions. The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and the Unstructured Simulating WAves Nearshore (UnSWAN) models were selected for this study. A coarser version of the state-of-the-art, southern Louisiana, unstructured mesh was developed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining critical hydraulic features. Model outputs were reviewed and analyzed from coastwide and onshore-transect points of view. The potential benefits of restoration and protection projects proposed in the Master Plan were examined by comparing Future without Action outputs to the Master Plan outputs. Hurricane protection projects, such as levees, provide remarkable protection at their leesides but increase and redistribute surge water at their front sides. Narrow, restored landscapes, such as barrier islands or ridges, may provide wave attenuation to some extent but, in many cases, provide minimal benefits in surge level reduction. Larger-scale restoration projects, such as sediment diversions, can result in land accretion and enhance vegetation coverage, thus resulting in notable benefits associated with damping waves and storm surge and ultimately reducing risk for inland communities.

AB  - The potential scale and impact of biological invasions in coastal waters is demonstrated by invasions in the San Francisco Bay/Delta Estuary. Biodiversity, ecosystem processes and human activities have already been substantially affected, while new organisms continue to be introduced into the ecosystem. Protecting coastal biodiversity, and preventing new impacts on the human use of coastal resources, will require regulation of the various mechanisms by which exotic marine and freshwater organisms are transported across oceans and continents to California. The broad scope of the problem is known, as are some of the steps needed to reduce the rate of transport and invasion. The most critical vector now operating is undoubtedly the transport of organisms in ships' ballast water. To reduce the flood of invasions into California's coastal waters, there is an urgent need for the adoption and implementation of clear legal requirements for the high-seas exchange of ballast water.

AB  - Salt marsh restoration is hypothesized to provide shoreline stabilization, increased fish habitat, and organic carbon subsidies for estuarine food webs. Organic carbon comes from diverse primary producers that differ in carbon fixation rates and areal extent within wetland systems. This study was designed to obtain some of the first estimates of the relative contribution of different primary producers to total organic carbon production within open water and tidally flooded wetlands of the northern San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Carbon fixation rates of phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, and low marsh emergent vegetation were measured in two natural and four restoring wetlands in 2004. Areal (m(2)) rates of carbon fixation were greatest for low marsh vegetation, while phytoplankton and microphytobenthos rates were one and two orders of magnitude lower, respectively. However, when areal production rates were scaled to the amount of habitat available for each primary producer group, the relative importance of each group varied by location. Given that each primary producer group supports a different subset of estuarine consumers, the type of food subsidy desired should influence the amount open water channel, mudflat and low marsh area restored. Large-scale wetland restoration activities should consider the types of primary producers likely to occupy restored habitats when estimating future food web impacts.

AB  - Current conventional erosion protection techniques are both costly and can detract from the natural environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe how Presque Isle State Park, located along the shoreline of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania, implemented a low-cost and innovative erosion protection project. Erosion within the back bay area of the park threatened the park's heavily used multi-purpose trail. With a matching grant from the Great Lakes Commission, the park developed a plan that placed riprap off the shoreline of the trail, anchored downed trees from the park in the riprap to function as timber groins, and then filled in the area between the trail and the riprap with sand dredged from a local sandbar. Geotextile and wattles were then positioned in the fill to aid in vegetative rooting. After placement of the geotextile and the wattles, indigenous vegetation was transplanted in the newly created area. Completion of the project resulted in several additional hectares of stabilized vegetation while providing an economical, natural, and aesthetic alternative to conventional shoreline erosion protection. The project affords a valuable example to other parks and recreational facilities along the Great Lakes faced with the challenge of minimizing erosion and maintaining a natural appearance.

AB  - Consideration of sustainability principles and the assessment of impacts from multiple developments on sensitive estuarine and coastal environments are emerging factors in the planning of coastal infrastructure. Concurrent planning of four large schemes at Saltend on the Humber (including Hull sewage-treatment works, a power station, a ferry terminal and reclamation, and flood-defence works) dictated that a cumulative impact study should be carried out. Discussions with regulatory authorities established several issues of potential concern, including the integrity of the adjacent ‘special protection area’(birds and ecology), estuarine flows, sediment movement and water quality, and construction traffic. Detailed baseline monitoring and predictive modelling concluded that there were likely to be no significant impacts, provided that appropriate inter-scheme construction phasing and coordinated application of a suite of mitigation measures were included. Adopting the precautionary principle, continued monitoring, and review over a 3-5 year period were agreed as part of the planning process, coordinated by the planning authorities and regulators. © 2017 Wiley.

AB  - Alterations to Louisiana's coastal landscape during the last 200 years have resulted in major changes to the natural hydrologic regime. Hurricane and tornado winds further impact coastal forests by exacerbating conditions that affect community structure, growth, and regeneration. Twenty-three years of study of forested wetlands in the Lake Verret watershed provide an opportunity to relate changes in forest communities to precipitation, drought, storms, and rising water levels. The area had two communities in 1986, but four communities were present by 2009. A major change in community composition occurred in drier sites after Hurricane Andrew (1992), when Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) became established. Swamp plots were generally not affected by hurricanes, but composition continued to change as a result of flooding. After Hurricane Andrew, net primary productivity (NPP) declined dramatically until 2001. Subsequent hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 also caused reductions in NPP, but recovery was rapid. Low-lying and transition areas are trending from bottomland communities toward more of a deepwater swamp as baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) increase their stature, likely due to the system-wide flooding. Natural ridges are flooded less often and have remained primarily bottomland, though Chinese tallow (Triadica sebiferum) numbers increased following Hurricane Andrew.

AB  - On 22 September 2001, a collision occurred between the M/V NEW AMITY and barge, NMS No. 1486 in the Houston Ship Channel. The collision resulted in damage to a single skinned fuel tank of the NEW AMITY and created an oil spill in Upper Galveston Bay near Morgans Point, Texas. The double-hulled cargo oil tanks on the NEW AMITY were not damaged. Additionally, none of the tanks on the NMS No. 1486 were damaged. Immediately after the incident, the damaged tanker was directed by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) and Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) to proeceed to the nearest lay berth. The Port of Houston Barbours Cut container terminal was less that a mile away and the tanker arrived while still leaking oil. A reported 36,000 gallons of IFO-380 was released before the source could be controlled; much of the oil being trapped under the pier structures within Barbours Cut. The oil spill impacted some 20 miles of shoreline habitat including salt marshes, sand and shell beaches, and riprap. The decision to move the vessel into Barbours Cut set the stage for a challenging, but ultimately successful spill response and cleanup. It was uniquely characterized by the difficult task of balancing safety, environmental, and commercial concerns during spill response. Response actions were conducted with the goal of minimizing impacts to commerce without compromising the environmental response and worker safety. The Shoreline Cleanup and Assessment Team (or SCAT) process was used to insure that environmental issues were addressed with participation of trustee agencies and to develop cleanup endpoints. Considering the volume of oil released into a sensitive estuarine system, the long-term impacts to the environment were relatively minor. To expedite cleanup, the entire 1.1 mile overhanging dock facility was cleared and four tugs were used to provide a unique method to flush oil out from under the dock into collection areas and open water mechanical skimming systems. Additionally, surface washing agents were used to enhance vessel and hard structure cleanup. Despite the extended response and difficult conditions, no major injuries were reported during the response. A complicating factor throughout was that the spill occurred just eleven days after the September 11th terrorist attack, as U.S. Coast Guard resources and local media were focused on maritime homeland security.

AB  - In February 2002 the City of Dublin experienced severe flooding as a result of what was believed to be a combination of unusually high tides and meteorological surges. The disruption to the city prompted the Dublin City Council to put in place a programme of works of which the Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Project is a seminal part. Subsequent analysis of tidal records and meteorological conditions has shown that the return period for the event of 1 February 2002 was not unusual. This paper will describe the development of a coastal flood forecasting system for the City of Dublin taking account of the state of coastal defences along the coast line as well as the Rivers Tolka, Dodder and Liffey. It will describe the role of numerical modelling to derive sea state conditions along the coastline affected. When coupled with a finite element hydrodynamic model, a model of the Rivers Liffey, Dodder and Tolka and overtopping, enable forecasts of future high tides and potential flooding to be made and actions taken. The emphasis is on the practical application of the results of the numerical modelling within a coastal flood forecasting system. The Paper will also describe the role of the project within the European Strategies & Actions For Emergency Risk management initiative (SAFER) and the development of best practice within a wider European context. The SAFER project has been constituted to promote a risk management approach to flooding focused on three central themes of: (a) provision of flood hazard and risk information; (b) flood emergency response planning and management delivered at the local level through (c) flood partnerships.

AB  - A sequence of vertically stacked shoreline facies exposed by unprecedented water level lowering in Lake St Lucia, South Africa, records multiple occupation of the same shoreline (5-6m amsl) on at least eight occasions since the late Cretaceous. The sequence involves a basal wave-cut surface that is the outcrop of a regional unconformity cut into Late Cretaceous siltstone with occasional borings, representing a hardground (Facies 1). This is succeeded by a limestone unit indicative of sedimentation in a region of low terrigenous input quite different to today. This commences with a 10cm-thick unit comprising corals and giant clams that colonised the hardground as a shallow reef (Facies 2). The reef has an erosional upper surface that is overlain by a 30-50cm thick coquina (Facies 3) with characteristic sand-lined branching burrows, representing a coarse elastic beach unit. This is equated with the Uloa Formation of Miocene/Pliocene age. This unit has in turn been colonised by a patchy development of a coral reef of a single species, representing a renewed phase of reef development (Facies 4). The reef and the underlying Facies 3 have been wave-planed and eroded to form an erosional rocky shoreline with small potholes on a shore platform. The potholes are encrusted with barnacles and oysters to form a distinctive unit (Facies 5). The oysters and barnacles are encrusted with red algae suggesting a slight subsequent rise in sea level which is also associated with the formation of an erosional notch and a higher level shore platform with several small erosional gullies (Facies 6). These gullies are in turn encrusted by thick accumulations of serpulid worm tubes (Facies 7) into which two subsequent notches have been cut by wave action. The shorelines preserved represent a succession of sea level highstands within a few metres of the contemporary sea level since Late Cretaceous times. They survived intervening sea level lowerings and fluvial incision by virtue of their location on an interfluve between adjacent incised valleys. Early cementation would have also been key to their preservation. Each shoreline facies was in turn influenced by the antecedent conditions imparted by the preceding shoreline as well as the contemporaneous conditions of sediment supply, sea level change and the surrounding palaeogeography. The presence of limestone and the absence of clasts or storm beach deposits suggests a protected coastline. The intermittent occurrence of coral and the reduced coral assemblage suggests that the water may not always have been fully marine.

AB  - Aims Plant mortality associated with the growing frequency and intensity of heatwaves and dry spells is increasingly occurring in various ecosystems worldwide. However, the impacts of extreme events on plant communities of ultramafic soils are still unknown. Here, we describe a first case of plant mortality on serpentine outcrops in Italy following a heat and drought event that occurred between autumn 2016 and summer 2017. Methods Mortality of perennial plants was assessed in thirty plots representing ten major serpentine areas along a SW-NE gradient, with the sparse vegetation of ultramafic soils. Statistical modelling was based on temperature and precipitation data and local site conditions. Results Responses of single species were largely different and not related to their taxonomic position, growth form or level of edaphic specialization for serpentine soils. Notably, obligate serpentine endemics were not less impacted than non-endemics. As expected, species mortality decreased with increasing chromosome number, suggesting higher tolerance and adaptive capacity in taxa of likely polyploid origin. Mortality increased with decreasing number of rainy days and duration of the heatwave and decreased with increasing distance from the Tyrrhenian coastline, reaching 60% in the southern and western areas with a Mediterranean climate. Local site conditions such as increasing soil depth and north-facing aspect significantly increased plant survivorship. Conclusions Our findings show that extreme drought and heat can have a previously unrealized impact on ultramafic plant communities in the short term. Further studies should examine the recovery capacity and resilience of serpentine plants, together with the long term effects.

AB  - Barrier islands are found around the world, and their geomorphic evolution is related to ocean and estuarine processes. Processes including sediment mobilization and shoreline evolution on both the ocean and estuarine side of barrier islands, control long-term evolution through many short-term (days) events (e.g., hurricanes, nor'easters). The Outer Banks of North Carolina are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Albemarle and Pamlico Sound Estuarine System, the second largest estuary in the U.S. Back-barrier environments in the system are extensive with over 1500 km of estuarine shoreline in Dare County (McVerry, 2012). The back-barrier coast of Rodanthe, a small town on the Outer Banks, consists of an undulating shoreline, adjacent to a broad (~4 km) shallow shoal ([less than 2] covered with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Shoreline and volumetric change rates, bathymetry, surface sediment grain properties, and hydrodynamic conditions were measured to evaluate sediment processes, SAV coverage and change over time. Understanding these back-barrier sediment processes is important for navigation, shoreline, and ecosystem management. Shoreline change rates (SCR) were evaluated using aerial photographs from five time steps (i.e., 1949, 1974, 2007, 2012, 2015). The average long-term SCR across the study region was -0.41 m y-1, but there was much variability. Data show the southern shoreline dominated by erosion and marsh loss with an increase in sediment banks and modification. Single-beam bathymetric confirmed the presence of a broad (~4 km) back-barrier shoal. Surface sediment grab samples displayed a dominance of fine sands with modest variation in grain size across the region and very low mud percent and organic content. Bathymetric change of the emergency navigational channel showed large deposition, and the timing suggests the importance of storm-related transport (e.g. Hurricanes Isabel, Ophelia, Irene). Calculated bed shear stresses based on the measured waves and currents indicate that bed shear stress during storms can exceed threshold of motion conditions (i.e., 0.18 N/m2) for the mean basin grain size (199 [micro]m). Aerial photography revealed the area was largely covered by SAV. Occurrence of SAV over 10 years showed little variation with consistent coverage. An optimal depth range of SAV (0.5-2.2 m) was determined based on bathymetric mapping. Three conclusions were derived from data: (1) Erosion and shoreline hardening are both important shoreline change process along on the back-barrier. High shoreline erosion rates and marsh shoreline loss lead to an increase in sediment banks or anthropogenically modified shorelines. (2) Critical shear stresses of motion are exceeded episodically with fresh breezes or stronger winds ([greater than] 10 m s-1), and ferry channel bathymetry suggest considerable sediment transport and deposition during high-wind events (e.g., hurricanes). The dominant back-barrier shoal sediments were clean, medium sands (i.e., low mud %, low loss on ignition). The low mud percent and low loss on ignition are likely maintained by regular wave reworking. (3) SAV in the study area has been persistent through time at water depths between 0.5-2.2 m. This depth range is consistent with other SAV studies and is attributable to water-level and light limitations.

AB  - Portugal's northwest coast, between Ovar and Marinha Grande presents an important sediment deficit, mainly due to rivers sediments supply reduction and harbors' constrains. This work's objective is to present an analysis of the shoreline evolution, in order to select a suitable model of coastal intervention. Thus, the current paper aimed a diagnostic based in the shoreline evolution indicators in the period between 1994-2011: 1. average rate of shoreline retreat; 2. number of coastal defense structures implemented; 3. number of coastal emergency works and interventions; and 4. number of registered events related to shoreline retreat (overtopping, dune system and coastal structures partial destruction). This analysis highlights the location of the most vulnerable areas. Furthermore, different scenarios of coastal defense interventions are discussed, having as variable the associated investment costs, which represents different strategies and impacts, namely maintain the existent coastal defense structures, adapt the existent coastal defense structures, perform artificial nourishments, and propose new coastal defense solutions.

AB  - 1. Foveaux Strait, a narrow seaway that is exposed to heavy wave action and strong tidal currents, has been the subject of an oyster fishery for over 130 years. Before the oyster fishery commenced the seafloor was extensively covered by epifaunal reefs that were tidally-oriented, linear aggregations of patch reefs. 2. Patch reefs are formed by the bryozoan Cinctipora elegans cemented by encrusting bryozoa, ascidians, sponges, and polychaetes. The molluscan epifauna is dominated by the oyster, Tiostrea chilensis and bysally attached bivalves. Mortality of oysters is probably lower and recruitment and growth may be higher within the reef habitat. 3. Fishers found commercial densities of oysters occurred only on epifaunal reefs. Fishers exploited local groups of reefs. These groups form the patchily distributed oyster beds characteristic of this fishery. 4. Dredging for oysters progressively modified reefs until oysters were the only epifauna remaining. Dredges caught oysters more efficiently after the catch bag no longer became saturated with other epifauna. This heightened efficiency allowed fishers to rapidly reduce oyster density to commercial extinction. Oyster density has not rebuilt on oyster beds abandoned by fishers. 5. The rate of modification of epifaunal reefs was slower during the early years of the fishery but has accelerated, especially over the last 37 years. Frequency of disturbance increased as the numbers of vessels fishing grew and fishers developed speedier dredging methods. Intensity of disturbance also increased as heavier dredges were introduced and allowed focused fishing of reefs. 6. Oysters became reduced to low densities in the eastern and central areas that fishers then abandoned. The commercially exploited area subsequently expanded to the limits of Foveaux Strait. 7. With accelerated modification of oyster habitat, disease mortality has become more important, 8. Attempting to rebuild the fishery by oyster enhancement may be more successful conjoined with habitat restoration.

AB  - A case history concerning the design and management aspects of a coastal protection system built by the Italian National Railway Authority (NRA) during the 80's is reported. The intervention was built in order to protect the main national railway line to Sicily from the severe damages induced by the wave action. In particular, the impact of a breakwater/groin system, based on a T-shaped structure, along the Tyrrhenian coast from Paola to San Lucido, in the South of Italy, has been considered. In 2005, the local Administration (San Lucido Municipality) promoted a lawsuit against the NRA. The local Administration denounced the negative effect of the intervention arguing that the presence of the defense structures caused an accretion of sediments in the protected area and interrupted the long-shore sediment transport, determining a relevant downdrift beach erosion. The case of a lawsuit evoking a loss of beach induced by maritime works represents the first case in Italy. The Court decision stated that the shore protection structures built along the coast between Paola and San Lucido represent an obstacle to the long-shore sediment transport in the north-south direction. The sentence obliged the NRA to pay a sum of money per year in favour of the San Lucido Municipality to be invested for the construction of new coastal protection structures. The present paper describes the local wave climate, the intervention, its monitored effects on morphodynamics, and the technical discussion which was held in front of the Court in 2006.

AB  - Today the Ria de Aveiro of northern Portugal has a hydromorphological regime in which river influence is limited to periods of flood. For most of the annual cycle, tidal currents and wind waves are the major forcing agents in this complex coastal lagoon-estuarine system. The system has evolved over two centuries from one that was naturally fluvially dominant to one that is today tidally dominant. Human influence was a trigger for these changes, starting in 1808 when its natural evolution was halted by the construction of a new inlet/outlet channel through the mobile sand spit that isolates it from the Atlantic Ocean. In consequence, tidal ranges in the lagoon increased rapidly from ∼0.1 m to >1 m and continued to increase, as a result of continued engineering works and dredging, today reaching ∼3 m on spring tides. Hydromorphological adjustments that have taken place include the deepening of channels, an increase in the area of inter-tidal flats, regression of salt marsh, increased tidal propagation and increased saline intrusion. Loss of once abundant submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), due to increased tidal flows, exacerbated by increased recreational activities, has been accompanied by a change from fine cohesive sediments to coarser, mobile sediments with reduced biological activity.

AB  - The post-glacial succession in the Cobequid Bay - Salmon River incised valley contains two sequences, the upper one incomplete. The lower sequence contains only highstand system tracts (HST) deposits which accumulated under microtidal, glacio-marine deltaic conditions. The upper sequence contains two, retrogradationally stacked parasequences. The lower one accumulated in a wave-dominated estuarine environment under micro-mesotidal conditions. It belongs to the lowstand system tract (LST) or early transgressive system tract (TST) depending on the timing and location of the lowstand shoreline, and contains a gravel barrier that has been overstepped and preserved with little modification. The upper parasequence accumulated in the modern, macrotidal estuary, and is assignable to the late TST. Recent, net progradation of the fringing marshes indicates that a new HST has begun. The sequence boundary separating the two sequences was formed by fluvial incision, and perhaps also by subtidal erosion during the relative sea level fall. Additional local erosion by waves and tidal currents occurred during the transgression. The base of the macrotidal sands is a prominent tidal ravinement surface which forms the flooding surface between the backstepping estuarine parasequences; Because fluvial deposition continued throughout the transgression, the fluvial-estuarine contact is diachronous and cannot be used as the transgressive surface. The maximum flooding surface will be difficult to locate in the macrotidal sands, but is more easily identified in the fringing muddy sediments. These observations indicate that: (1) large incised valleys may contain a compound fill that consists of more than one sequence; (2) relative sea lever changes determine the stratal stacking patterns, but local environmental factors control the nature of the facies and surfaces; (3) these surfaces may have complex origins, and commonly become amalgamated; (4) designation of the transgressive surface (and thus the LST) is particularly difficult as many of the prominent surfaces in the valley fill are diachronous facies boundaries; and (5) the transgression of complex topography may cause geologically instantaneous changes in tidal range, due to resonance under particular geographical configurations.

AB  - Analysis of long-term land use and land cover (LULC) changes requires up-to-date remotely sensed data to assess their effects on erosion. This is a particularly important assessment for regions with semi-arid landscapes where soils tend to be scarce and proper management necessitates matching LULC to local conditions to achieve sustainable land use. This study evaluates the impact of LULC changes on erosion using Landsat satellite imagery and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model on the plains around the Jarahi River and the Shadegan International Wetlands. Supervised-classification and maximum-likelihood methods were applied to pre-processed TM, ETM, and OLI images for 1989, 2003, and 2017 to prepare LULC maps. The areal extents of agricultural land, wetlands, waterbodies, and built-up regions increased by 9.48%, 2.52%, 3.44%, and 0.13% from 1989 to 2003, respectively. During this timeframe bare (or barren) lands and wetland vegetation decreased by 11.44% and 4.13%. Between 2003 and 2017, however, the areas of bare lands, waterbodies, and built-up areas increased 12.77%, 1.52%, and 0.30%, while agricultural lands, wetlands, and wetland vegetation decreased by 9.99%, 1.32%, and 3.27%. According to the results, the areal extent of erosion at a rate > 1.1-5 Mg ha(-1 )year(-1) has been increased by about 45.56%, 50.06% and 52.24 between 1989, 2003 and 2017. LULC changes led to increased soil erosion on agricultural and bare lands. This highlights the need to plan and manage changes to LULC to reduce erosion to and below sustainable levels. Nature-based solutions can be effectively used to reduce erosion.

AB  - New concrete pontoons for the SR520 Bridge Replacement Project in Seattle, Washington, were constructed at a new casting basin facility located in Aberdeen, WA, as a design-build project by Kiewit Corporation. Upon completion, the pontoons were towed from the casting basin into the nearby Chehalis River and Grays Harbor estuary via a 620-foot-long launch channel. The launch channel was constructed in December 2011 and the first completed pontoons were towed from the casting basin in July 2012; pontoon production will continue. This paper presents numerical modeling analysis, engineering design, and performance of the launch channel, including analysis of hydrodynamic forces on pontoons due to currents and passing vessel effects in the adjacent deep draft federal navigation channel. Due to the location of the launch channel and casting basin in the estuarine portion of the Chehalis River, the site is subject to processes including combined effects of tides, wind, waves, river discharge and vessel effects. All these factors were considered in designing the channel and estimating forces on the pontoons. Geomorphic analysis and three-dimensional numerical modeling were the basis for determining that the channel would initially experience a period of relatively more rapid sedimentation followed by more gradual sedimentation rates. Such rates of sedimentation were incorporated into the dredging plan as advance maintenance to minimize maintenance dredging frequency. The launch channel side slopes, composed of native soft silty sediments, are subject to erosion and scour primarily due to propeller wash from tugs operating in the channel. Numerical modeling of waves, currents, and propwash was performed to optimize the extents and type of armoring required. Based upon this analysis and coordination with professional tug operators, the final design achieved a significant reduction of rock armoring while maintaining protection for the channel slopes against scour. A unique rock slope key design was developed to transition from armored to soft unarmored slopes. Recommendations for turning dolphin design and tug operations were based on numerical modeling of effects of riverine and tidal currents on the pontoons at various positions in the channel and at various flows. Forces, moments, and pontoon motions were also developed to account for the potential effects of passing vessels on rafts of multiple completed pontoons temporarily moored along the navigation channel. These were provided to naval architects for design of mooring systems. Ongoing monitoring of the channel bathymetry indicates that the actual sedimentation rates were slightly lower than predicted. Side slope protection and towing forces appear adequate for continued cycling of pontoon construction into the future.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of a series of laboratory measurements of wave-induced morphodynamic changes across a simulated beach protected by a number of erosion control systems constructed from geotextiles and subjected to irregular waves of varying wave height and peak period but with a constant spectral shape (JONSWAP spectrum, γ=3.3). The objectives of such experimental work were to investigate the efficiency of various systems in maintaining a beach and in protecting the shoreline. For this purpose different models of active and passive coastal defence schemes have been set-up to run on similar hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions. The intercomparison carried out on the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic output produced by each protection scheme focused on the scour development and more widespread beach lowering. The next step was to increase understanding of the response of the beach under persistent erosional conditions and under periods of erosion followed by infilling and again erosion.

AB  - The coastline of Bangladesh is mostly exposed to extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions where cyclones and storm surges cause devastating effects including loss of human lives and destruction of properties. Coastal vegetation has been considered as a low-cost and natural protection to reduce the energy of current and surge. Present study explored the effectiveness of coastal vegetation against cyclonic storm surge based on species composition, forest width and near-shore run-up slope revealed by field investigations and numerical simulations. A calibrated hydrodynamic numerical model based on modified one-dimensional depth-averaged non-linear long wave differential equations was used to simulate the storm surge mitigation effected by the coastal vegetation. Considering two different types of coastal species, mangrove species, Rhizophora apiculata and beach species, Casuarina equisetifolia, numerical simulations were conducted to assess the effect of coastal forest on the storm surge mitigation. This analysis showed that double layers of wide vegetation belt (300 m) in the vertical direction with R. apiculata and C. equisetifolia on mild slope (1:500) exhibited a strong potential to decrease surge wave height and velocity. However, water depth reduction was low compared with flow velocity reduction. The maximum water depth and current velocity reduced to 1.4m (22% reduction) and 1.2m/s (49% reduction), respectively, behind the vegetation in comparison with the case without vegetation. Wide coastal vegetation belt with mild slope might be suitable for storm surge energy reduction; however, a doubling or tripling of forest width (from 100 m to 200 m or 300 m) did not produce two-fold or three-fold increase of wave reduction with negligible additional velocity reduction. For the same vegetation density the wave energy reduction by R. apiculata was not increased significantly compared to the C. equisetifolia. But young densely C. equisetifolia found more effective to reduce storm surge energy. The information would be of value to policy and decision makers for coastal landscape planning, rehabilitation and coastal resource management.

AB  - Question: The vegetation in a polder after partial tidal restoration does not resemble the targeted salt-marsh vegetation. Is this difference in vegetation due to lack of dispersal or unsuitable abiotic conditions ? What could be done for a better restoration of the site? Location: Northwestern France. Methods: Seeds were trapped at the single inlet of the polder with a 200-mu m mesh net to estimate inputs of seeds from the bay. In parallel, seed dispersal was studied in the polder by placing Astroturf(R) seed traps on the surface of the sediment at three different elevations in three distinct areas. Abiotic conditions such as flooding frequency, water table level and soil salinity were monitored. Results: All but one species from the adjacent salt marshes were trapped at the inlet. Not all of these species were on the seed traps inside the polder. Seed dispersal was not homogeneous in the polder and seed trap content mostly discriminated in function of their elevation. Salinity and water logging at the bottom of the slope were very high compared to tolerance of most halophytes but decreased rapidly higher up the slope. Conclusions: The development of salt marsh target species is highly restricted by limited hydrochory inside the polder but also by unfavourable soil conditions induced by the actual hydrological regime. Halophytes are excluded at the bottom of the slope by abiotic conditions and out-competed by sub-halophytes higher up. In order to restore salt marsh vegetation inside the polder, a larger opening should be induced in order to increase the flooded surface, and diminish water logging and flooding frequencies.

AB  - The problem of the reflection of incident surface water waves by undulations on the seabed is treated on the basis of linear perturbation theory. The flow is assumed to be two-dimensional, uniplanar and nonseparating, and the undulations are assumed to be of limited horizontal extent, enabling results for the reflected and transmitted waves to be obtained by Fourier transform methods. A steady state formulation of the problem is adopted, and this provides general results which are applied to the case of a patch of sinusoidal undulations on the bed. The principal conclusions are that the reflection coefficient is both oscillatory in the ratio of the length of the patch to the surface wavelength and also, as expected, critically dependent on the ratio of the surface to bed wavelengths. In addition, the transmitted wave may experience a small phase shift, even in cases of zero reflection. Examples are presented which indicate that relatively few bottom undulations, with wavenumber equal to approximately twice the surface wavenumber, may give rise to a very substantial reflected wave. A possible consequence of this is a coupling between ripple growth and wave reflection, which may be important in problems of coastal protection.

AB  - Sea level rise is expected to increase worldwide over the coming decades, and its impacts are beginning to be felt in many areas. Two major direct impacts of sea level rise are submergence and salinity increase. Historically, the Mississippi River Delta has experienced a relative sea level rise (RSLR) and thus serves as an analogy or model for what can be expected elsewhere. Despite long-term RSLR, primarily due to subsidence, the Mississippi has grown in size over the past several thousand years since eustatic sea level stabilized. Within this century, the net positive growth rate has been reversed and net wetland loss rates as great as 100 km super(2) /yr have occurred. Much of the wetland loss is associated with human activities that have resulted in a reduction of sediment input to wetlands. Because of this reduction, vertical accretion of the wetland surface is less than RSLR and plants are disappearing due to waterlogging and salinity increase. The resulting loss of wetland plant vigor complicates the problem because the production of plant roots is an important component of soil formation and vertical accretion of the wetland surface. Two important points to consider in addressing the problem of sea level rise is that there is often a lag time of decades before the response of the natural system to sea level rise becomes evident and that changes in the natural system may be slow at first and then accelerate. The institutional response in Louisiana is complicated, but many of the actions taken may be detrimental in the long run. A common response to rising water levels will be flood control. But in the Mississippi Delta, dikes along the river have greatly restricted sediment input to wetlands. Additionally, semi-impoundments with water control structures are being considered to protect wetlands from increasing water levels and salinity increases. Many of these depend upon gravity drainage, but in a microtidal area such as the Gulf coast, gravity drainage has a finite life-span because of rising water levels. Land ownership patterns also complicate a comprehensive approach to the problem because of units selected for management and conflict between short- and long-term benefits. It is concluded that coastal wetlands can be managed to survive rising sea level, but that only comprehensive, integrated long-term planning can effectively deal with the problem of sea level rise. The principle of ecological engineering, where the energies of nature are used as much as possible, should play an integral part of any management plan. Because deltas are probably among the most threatened of coastal landscapes, an early warning monitoring system is recommended for selected deltas of the world.

AB  - <jats:p>Because of a new Master Plan for Coastal Protection, most Belgian coastal cities are planning new protective measures for their beaches and coastal promenades. One of the first locations for these new measures is the coastal town of Wenduine. Three separate new constructions will be designed to protect the town as well as the coastal region for the following 50 years. As opposed to purely vertical or horizontal surface structures, structures consisting of both vertical parapets and horizontal slabs have rarely been considered. The behavior of these structures is more similar to bridge conduct, since the incident loads vary with time and space, than to classic coastal structures. The effect of wave impact on these structures results in local patch loading on a swaying system, introducing local deformations, stresses, and accelerations. This patch loading may cause local deformations, but does not necessarily cause collapse or endanger neither structural equilibrium nor stability. This article studies the structural response of monolithic concrete coastal protection structures. The focus is on the structural response of the structure, comfort conditions for use, and structural safety. This is analyzed by numerical modeling of the structural response based on recently proposed design values for such wave loading. These models include the actual structure as well as the influence of foundations and ground layers.</jats:p>

AB  - Recent studies in salt marshes have demonstrated the role of plant roots in sediment stabilisation, and hence the importance of marshes in providing coastal protection. However, the relative role of root traits and environmental factors in controlling sediment stability, and how intraspecific variability of root traits vary within and among marshes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated which root trait(s) drive sediment stability (resistance to lateral erosion) in two marsh species with an important role in coastal protection (Spartina anglica and Atriplex portulacoides) and how the environment affects the expression of these traits. We sampled three marshes along salinity gradients in each of two estuaries in Wales (UK), establishing replicate plots in the respective dominant zones of each species. In all plots we sampled abiotic variables (sand, redox potential, pH, salinity) and root traits (root density, specific root density, root volume, root length density); in a subset of these plots (three per species in each marsh) we extracted soil-plant cores and assessed their erosion resistance in a flume. Sediment stability was enhanced by increases in root density and reductions in sand content. Abiotic variables affected root density in different ways depending on species: in S. anglica, redox was the only significant factor, with a positive, linear effect on root density; in A. portulacoides, redox had a non-linear (U-shaped) effect on root density, while sand had a negative effect. Collectively, these results show that (i) intraspecific variability in root density can influence sediment stability in salt marshes, and (ii) sediment properties not only influence sediment stability directly, but also indirectly via root density. These results shed light on spatial variability in the stability of salt marshes to lateral erosion and suggest that root density should be incorporated into coastal vegetation monitoring programs as an easy-to-measure root trait that links the environment to sediment stability and hence to the function and services provided by marshes.

AB  - Tidal stream energy is a reliable and predictable low-carbon energy source. Over the next few years the first arrays of multiple tidal stream turbines will be deployed mostly in UK, French and Canadian waters. The potential environmental effects should first be examined, in order to scale and site them appropriately. Large theoretical arrays of tidal stream turbines were designed for Scottish Waters (UK), to quantify the available power and the ocean response to its extraction. A comprehensive assessment of the tidal energy resource realistically available for electricity generation and the study of the potential environmental impacts associated with its extraction in Scottish Waters, can then lead the way to further development in different countries with potential tidal stream energy sources. In order to examine both local $(<100\\ \\text{km})$ and region-wide $(> 100\\ \\text{km})$ spatial scales, the Scottish Shelf Model, an unstructured grid three-dimensional FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) implementation, is a useful tool, since it covers the entire NW European Shelf, but with a high resolution where the tidal stream energy is extracted. The arrays of tidal stream turbines were implemented in the model using the momentum sink approach, in which a momentum sink term represents the loss of momentum due to tidal energy extraction. A typical annual cycle of the NW European Shelf hydrodynamics was reproduced by the SSM model and compared with the same period perturbed by tidal stream energy extraction. The power extracted by the tidal stream arrays was estimated, taking into account the tidal stream energy extraction feedbacks on the flow and considering the realistic operation of a generic tidal stream turbine, which is limited to operate in a range of flow velocities due to technological constraints. The ocean response to tidal stream power extraction was then analysed at the temporal scale of a spring-neap tidal cycle and, for the first time, on longer term seasonal timescales. It is shown that the very large tidal stream arrays can introduce detectable changes to the tidal elevation, marine currents and ocean stratification patterns. Tidal elevation mainly increases upstream of the tidal farms locations (considering the direction of propagation of the tidal wave), while a decrease in the mean spring tidal range is observed downstream, along the UK East Coast and also in the Irish Sea. Marine currents, both tidal and residual flows, are also affected. They can slow down due to the turbines' action or speed up due to flow diversion and blockage processes, on both a local and regional scale. The strongest signal in tidal velocities is an overall reduction, which can in turn decrease the energy of tidal mixing and perturb the seasonal stratification on the NW European Shelf. Although the strength of summer stratification has been found to slightly increase, the extent of the stratified region does not greatly change, thus suggesting the enhanced biological and pelagic biodiversity hotspots, e.g. tidal mixing front locations, are not displaced. Such large-scale tidal stream energy extraction is unlikely to occur in the near future, since very large numbers of devices are required, but such potential changes should be considered when planning future tidal energy exploitation. It is likely that large scale developments around the NW European shelf will interact and could, for example, intensify or weaken the changes predicted here, or even be used as mitigation measures (e.g. coastal defence) for other changes, e.g. effects of climate change.

AB  - As a result of the construction of a storm-surge barrier across the mouth of the Oosterschelde (SW Netherlands) in 1987, the tidal range and mean high water level in the estuary have been reduced permanently to about 88% of their original values. During the final stage of construction (1985-1987) the tidal range and mean high water level were reduced even further for more than 18 months, by up to about 65% of their original values. This paper describes the consequences of these reductions for some abiotic aspects of the salt marshes. Strong ripening of the soil, especially in basins of the middle high salt marshes, resulted in the soils in these basins having more or less the dry nature of levees. This may cause moisture deficits for the vegetation during dry periods locally, and may lead locally to acidification of the soil as a result of oxidation of pyrite. Erosion of the edges of the salt marshes has increased in many places since 1986, both due to lowering of the surface level of the foreland, causing wave action to affect the marsh cliff more strongly than before, and weakening of cliff strength as a consequence of desiccation of the salt marsh soil and subsequent withering of plants and plant roots. In addition, the gradual salt marsh gradients have decreased on a large scale, as a consequence of increased wave attack and frost damage to Spartina. Finally, also due to desiccation and plant withering, levees have degraded and eroded, forming shoulders in the creeks. Settling, especially in the basins, has steepened and narrowed the height gradients between basin and levee. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - During the period 1981-1990 the functioning of microphytobenthos in the carbon cycle was studied in the Oosterschelde, a mesotidal, euhaline estuary (SW Netherlands), both before and after completion of a storm-surge barrier in the sea ward entrance of the estuary in 1986, which reduced the tidal range to 88% and current velocities to 70% of their former values on average. The annual biomass cycle has changed from small spring and autumn peaks into a much larger summer peak. The average biomass during summer has increased from 70 to 170 mg Chlorophyll-a m2. The average annual biomass has increased from 115 to 195 mg Chlorophyll-a m2. As a consequence the (calculated) primary production by microphytobenthos has increased also, from 150 to 242 gC m-2 y-1 (14 045 to 22 265 tonnes C y-1), and its share in the total primary production of the Oosterschelde has increased from 16 to 30%. These increases in biomass and primary production are mainly ascribed to a decrease in the dynamic forces (water current velocities) over the intertidal flats in most parts of the basin. Increased water transparency in parts of the estuary and increased import of inorganic carbon from the water column towards shoals may have contributed as well. The rate of reworking of the top layer of the soil (0-10 cm) has not changed significantly, as the decrease in Chlorophyll-a biomass with depth has hardly changed. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A storm-surge barrier was constructed in the mouth of the Oosterschelde, a euhaline mesotidal estuary in the SW Netherlands (mean tidal range 3.6 m). As a consequence, the tidal range and the Mean High Water in the estuary have been reduced to about 88% of their original values. During the final construction stage of this barrier (1986-87) both were reduced to a maximum of 65% for more than 18 months. During this period, large-scale die-back of the vegetation occurred in vast areas on the salt marshes; locally, a complete die-back of the vegetation took place. Glycophytes and disturbance indicating species appeared on a large scale and grew abundantly. After the new tidal regime had been established, the vegetation recovered. The species characteristic of disturbance, are gradually being replaced by perennial salt marsh species. In addition, most species are shifting into zones of lower elevation, which correspond (in 1990/1991) more or less with the original flooding frequencies. Moreover, in many basins the 'levee'-species Halimione portulacoides and Elymus pycnanthus are far more prominent than before, probably as a result of the strong ripening of the soil that has occurred in these basins during the extra tidal reduction. In 1991, four years after the establishment of the new tidal regime, the salt marsh vegetation had still not been stabilized. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Riverine floods and coastal inundation by storm surges are the most frequent of natural disasters, affecting millions of people across the globe every year. The forecasting of floods and storm surge at the global scale is crucial to preparing for severe events and providing early awareness where local models and warning services are lacking. Developments in modelling capabilities, data availability, and computational resources in recent years have made it possible to produce global scale flood forecasts. Operational systems currently have the capability to produce discharge and water level forecasts in the medium-range and disseminate forecasts and early warning products in real time across the globe, in support of national forecasting capabilities. Deltares currently runs two global forecasting systems: Global Flood Forecasting Information System (GLOFFIS) and Global Storm Surge Information System (GLOSSIS). These systems are run from an open experimental information and communications technology facility, IdLab, and are being used to test new ideas around interoperability, hydrological/hydrodynamical predictability, big data, and visualization. GLOFFIS and GLOSSIS produce global flood and storm surge forecasts up to four times per day, with a 10 day forecast horizon (Deltares, 2017). These forecasts can be used for early warning in areas that currently lack adequate local forecasting capabilities. In areas where such capabilities are already available, these systems can provide boundary conditions to regional or local models to further improve these. The underlying hydrodynamic and hydrological models are constantly improved and updated, to further increase their accuracy. With improvements in weather forecasting, future advances may include more seamless hydrological forecasting at the global scale alongside a move towards multi-model forecasts and grand ensemble techniques, responding to the need of developing multi-hazard early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. The global forecasts from GLOFFIS and GLOSSIS are made available through various online channels, like web applications and FTP. A subset of results has been made available free of charge in June 2017 via www.GlobalFloodForecast.com. It is foreseen that the full or higher resolution results will be provided through a service with subscription fee by the end of 2017. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

AB  - The Dutch lowland rivers Rhine and Meuse have lost much of their natural character and many species of riverine fish have become rare or extinct due to water pollution, habitat loss, and exploitation over the last century. Since the 1980s, management measures have been taken to improve water quality and to restore habitats and fish migration opportunities. Rehabilitation includes amongst others enhancing the active floodplain dynamics through (re)connecting isolated floodplain waters to the main river channel. Fish passages along weirs and sluices have been constructed and, at dammed estuaries, discharge regimes will be adjusted to facilitate fish migration. There are several lines of evidence that these measures have contributed to a rehabilitation of riverine fish populations. Studies in newly created side channels demonstrate the enhancement of nursery habitat. A cost-effective monitoring programme based on registration of by-catches from commercial (fykenet) fishermen carried out since 1993 in the Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands reveals that the population levels of many rare (mainly red list) species show increasing trends, demonstrating the improvement of the ecological quality of Rhine and Meuse. Rehabilitation of the floodplain function and reducing the impact of hydromorphological barriers could further enhance fish populations at the river basin level. The response of different fish species to river rehabilitation has been variable and may have different causes. We conclude that fish community changes are sensible indicators of ecological rehabilitation when the response time (≥ 10 years) is taken into account, which requires long-term monitoring.

AB  - Ecosystem-based coastal protection by means of conserving, restoring or creating intertidal ecosystems that attenuate waves and stabilize shorelines, offers a promising way to climate proof coastlines for the future. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an ecosystem engineering species, which is known for its wave attenuating and sediment trapping ecosystem services, but it remains unknown to which extent this is conditional. We aim to test the hypothesis that the ecosystem engineering effect concerning sediment trapping and stability by oyster reefs is conditional, and can be predicted based on i) local physical forcing, ii) morphological characteristics of the tidal flat, and iii) biological characteristics of the oyster reef. Analyses of long-term sediment accretion patterns on natural intertidal oyster reefs at the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands) showed that this ecosystem engineering effect is strongest on tidal flats under erosional conditions, lower aspect ratio (i.e., relative long and narrow reefs), relatively closed reefs (i.e., few open patches) and higher coverage of oysters within reef patches. The ability of C. gigas to shape the environment thus depends both on biotic and abiotic conditions, meaning that oyster reefs only work under specific conditions for erosion control. Overall, our results provide baseline understanding for ecosystem management aimed at affecting sediment dynamics, thereby contributing to a better understanding for designing ecosystem-based solutions under different abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, present study provides a clear example of how we need to gain a better understanding of the conditionality of ecosystem services in general, to be able to create and restore ecosystems for obtaining their services.

AB  - The Dutch Delta Region (S-W Netherlands) originally consisted of interconnected estuaries, interfacing the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheide with the North Sea. The ecosystems were immature, with physical rather than biological control of population dynamics. Main functions were shipping and shellfisheries. An emergent function of the interconnected estuaries was the buffering and upgrading of river-borne substances before they entered the sea. Execution of the Delta Project in the period 1960-1986 resulted in isolation of several water systems disconnected from rivers and sea, and loss of gradients within these systems. Population dynamics were now controlled by chemical and biological rather than physical factors. Vulnerability to external perturbation increased. These changes also affected the buffering capacity, i.e. reduced the utility of the area as stabiliser of the geosystem. Recreational use and appreciation of natural values increased, potentially conflicting with shipping and shellfisheries. Retrospective analysis of the environmental policy and management revealed three consecutive strategies in the Delta Project. 1. Reactive one-issue management, focusing on safety against flooding only. This strategy aimed at complete closure of the estuaries thus transforming them into fresh water lakes. It has destroyed feed-backs and buffering between coastal and inland waters. This strategy has not promoted sustainable development and has increased the vulnerability of the area to future catastrophes. 2. Protective bio-ecological management focused on the preservation of existing values of landscape and environment, and resulted in the maintenance of saline conditions and preservation of marshes by shore protection measures. The drawback of this passive orientation to existing values 'where they are now' is the necessity of continuous intensive care because the natural adaptive ability is not being restored. 3. Constructive geo-ecological management is based on understanding functional properties within and between ecosystems as integrated elements of the landscape structure. This strategy aims at environmental protection, restoration and development of values 'where they must be'. Re-establishment of gradients by e.g. re-introducing tidal influence and by restoring salt marshes should contribute to sustainable development.

AB  - The tidal dock called Deurganckdok (Port of Antwerp) is situated in the macro tidal estuary of the Scheldt River and is directly connected to the river without the shielding properties of a lock. Due to its position in the estuary near the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM) of the estuary, large amounts of silt and clay are available for sedimentation. The dock effectively acts as a sediment trap, with a trapping efficiency as high as 0.43. During the first five years after its commissioning, the sedimentation of the dock has been closely followed by means of intensive monitoring of both long-term point measurements and through tide campaigns with high spatial resolution. The mass balance of the dock's sediment bed has been monitored using density profiling. It was shown that the average rate of sedimentation of the dock is as high as 1 cm/day. A semi-empirical model of the siltation of the dock has been developed to gain insights in the contribution of the different mechanisms of sediment exchange with the Scheldt River. Long term siltation calculations shown the model is capable of reproducing the sediment balance of the dock. After numerical and physical modeling it was shown that a Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) has the potential to reduce the sedimentation in the dock (Roose et al, 2013). The construction of this structure has now been executed and the first monitoring results are available of the post-construction period. Due to the natural variability of the estuarine sediment concentration levels, the statistical trend change cannot be proven yet, but measurements of the flow pattern near the dock entrance reveal changes that can be incorporated in a semi-empirical model of the sedimentation, bringing forward first estimates of the sedimentation reduction in the dock.

AB  - With the increasing tendency of natural hazards, the typhoon, hurricane and tropical cyclone induced surge, wave, precipitation, flood and wind as extreme external loads menaced Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) in coastal provinces of China. For all of constructed NPP in China the National Nuclear Safety Administration of China and IAEA recommended Probable Maximum Hurricane /Typhoon/(PMH/T), Probable Maximum Storm Surge (PMSS), Probable Maximum Flood (PMF), Design Basis Flood (DBF) as safety regulations are used for NPP site evaluation installations and coastal defense infrastructures. This paper compare our proposed multivariate compound extreme value distribution (CEVD and MCEVD) with IAEA 2006-2011 recommended safety regulation for NPP coastal defense infrastructures along China coast. 2005 hurricane Katrina and 2012 hurricane Sandy induced disasters proved 1982 CEVD and 2006 MCEVD predicted extreme hazards in New Orleans and New Jersey areas. 2013 typhoon Fitow induced typhoon disaster in China also proved MCEVD 2004-2006 predicted results. The first and second costliest hurricane disasters in United States history occurred only in the past seven years. 2008 Typhoon Saomai induced 3.76 m storm surges and 7 m waves which caused 240 deaths, sunk 952 ships and damaged 1594 in Shacheng harbor. If typhoon Saomai had landed 2 hours later, then the simultaneous occurrence of the typhoon surge and high spring tide with 7 m wave would have inundated most areas of the Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, where Qinshan NPP were located. Extreme typhoon hazards menaced some constructed NPP coastal defense designed by traditional safety regulations.

AB  - Burning was evaluated as a method of remediating oiled Louisiana Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. A short-term reduction in plant biomass was observed; however, 1 year after burning, plant biomass was the same as in control plots. A comparison of the normal alkane profile in the soil residue following oiling to preburn oil showed a loss of more volatile hydrocarbons. Similar patterns were observed for aromatic hydrocarbons. More than half the aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the plume were derived from unburned hydrocarbons. Carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the main sulfur gases found in the smoke plume.

AB  - The Dutch safety assessment of dikes, dunes and storm surge barriers is carried out every 5 year, resulting in strengthening plans for the sections that do not comply with the safety standards. The Secretary of State provides the water defence authorities with Hydraulic Boundary Conditions. This paper handles the probabilistic approach to derive them, the method to carry out the safety assessment and the verification of the model based on the method by comparison with field data. The probabilistic approach is based on Monte Carlo Important Sampling. The method takes into account several failure mechanisms, such as overtopping and stability of revetments. The verification is carried out for several locations and shows a satisfactory agreement. Less good agreement is found at areas where currents affect the wave parameters like for instance in estuaries. In 2007 the derived Hydraulic Boundary Conditions were formalized by the Secretary of State for the coming safety assessment. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The Scheldt Estuary is an intensely shipped area, holding the fairway to the ports of Flushing, Terneuzen in the Netherlands and Ghent and Antwerp in Belgium. Since the 3rd deepening and widening of the fairway (2010), the shoals and sills along the main shipping channel are maintained at a depth of 14.5 m below LAT allowing for tide independent access to Antwerp for ocean ships up to 13.1 m draught. The sediment volume involved in the dredging activities amounts to 12.6 Mm3 and 10.1 Mm3 for the first two years and about 9 Mm3 (preliminary) in the third year. The deepening volume (for the Western Scheldt) amounted to a volume of 7.7 Mm3 as predicted in the environmental impact assessment. The maintenance volume is expected to further decrease due to the expected system's re-equilibration. The Flexible Disposal Strategy, aimed at creating ecologically valuable area, was set up in this framework. A first approach in the strategy is the disposal of dredged sediments on the edges of tidal flats to create lowdynamic, shallow water areas, beneficial for fauna development. A second approach is to dispose sediments in the deep parts of the fairway and the secondary channels. This contrasts to the former disposal strategy that consisted of disposal solely into secondary channels. Monitoring data are continuously acquired (bathymetry, topography, ADCP, dredging and disposal data, ...) for assessment of morphodynamical and ecological consequences. If necessary, the disposal strategy is adapted to reach the desired ecological goals and mitigate possible undesired effects. This process of monitoring is captured in monthly data reports and yearly detailed analysis in which the so-called 'Quality parameters' are tested to well-defined criteria. In this paper we discuss the deepening and subsequent maintenance dredging works in the Western Scheldt for the first three years after the start of the project. We describe the process of monitoring and analysis as a decision-making instrument in the approach of the Flexible Disposal Strategy.

AB  - Establishing trees in agricultural bottomlands is challenging because of intense competition, flooding and herbivory. A summary is presented of new practices and management systems for regenerating trees in former agricultural fields in the eastern USA. Innovations have come from improvements in planting stock and new silvicultural systems that restore ecological function more quickly than traditional afforestation with single-species stands. Advances in nursery production of large (e. g. 1-2 m tall; 1.5-2.0 cm basal diameter) bareroot and container seedlings with well-developed root systems have led to increases in survival and growth, and early seed production. In addition to planting high-quality seedlings, managing vegetation is critical to regeneration success. Planting seedlings with cover crops such as redtop grass (Agrostis gigantea Roth) may improve tree survival and growth by controlling competing vegetation and reducing animal herbivory. An innovative strategy that simulates natural succession involves interplanting later seral species such as Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii Palm.) in young plantations of pioneer species such as Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. Populus L. acts as a nurse crop for Quercus L. by reducing biomass of competing vegetation without seriously limiting Quercus L. seedling growth or function. Harvest of the short-rotation Populus L. crop releases the well-established Quercus L. trees. Success in afforestation requires planting high-quality seedlings using management practices that promote survival and growth. Restoration based on ecosystem processes, using tree species that have complementary ecological requirements, will be more successful and affordable than other methods.

AB  - The costs of coastal sector impacts from sea level rise (SLR) are an important component of the total projected economic damages of climate change, a major input to decision-making and design of climate policy. Moreover, the ultimate costs to coastal resources will depend strongly on adaptation, society's response to cope with the impacts. This paper presents a new model to assess coastal impacts from SLR, combining global scope with high spatial resolution to fill a gap between very detailed local studies and aggregate global estimates. The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) determines the optimal strategy for adaptation at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments, as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al, 2006), based on their socioeconomic characteristics and the potential impacts of relative sea level rise and uncertain storm surge. An application of CIAM is then presented to demonstrate the model's ability to assess local impacts and direct costs, choose the least-cost adaptation, and estimate global net damages for several probabilistic SLR scenarios (Kopp et al, 2014). CIAM finds that there is large potential for coastal adaptation to reduce the expected impacts of SLR compared to the alternative of no adaptation, lowering global net present costs by a factor of 10 to less than $1.5 trillion over the next two centuries, although this does not include initial transition costs to overcome an under-adapted current state. In addition to producing aggregate estimates, CIAM results can also be interpreted at the local level, where we find that retreat (e.g., relocate inland) is often a more cost-effective adaptation strategy than protect (e.g., construct physical defenses).

AB  - Coastal sector impacts from sea level rise (SLR) are a key component of the projected economic damages of climate change, a major input to decision-making and design of climate policy. Moreover, the ultimate global costs to coastal resources will depend strongly on adaptation, society’s response to cope with the local impacts. This paper presents a new open-source optimization model to assess global coastal impacts from SLR from the perspective of economic efficiency. The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) determines the optimal strategy for adaptation at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments, as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006), based on their socioeconomic characteristics and the potential impacts of relative sea level rise and uncertain sea level extremes. A deterministic application of CIAM demonstrates the model’s ability to assess local impacts and direct costs, choose the least-cost adaptation, and estimate global net damages for several climate scenarios that account for both global and local components of SLR (Kopp et al. 2014). CIAM finds that there is large potential for coastal adaptation to reduce the expected impacts of SLR compared to the alternative of no adaptation, lowering global net present costs through 2100 by a factor of seven to less than $1.7 trillion, although this does not include initial transition costs to overcome an under-adapted current state. In addition to producing aggregate estimates, CIAM results can also be interpreted at the local level, where retreat (e.g., relocate inland) is often a more cost-effective adaptation strategy than protect (e.g., construct physical defenses).

AB  - Benin is a country in West Africa with a little more than 120 kilometers of coastline. The main port at Cotonou serving the country of Benin was completed in 1963. According to Dibajnia and Nairn (2004), Benin’s coastline experiences incessant wave attack causing a longshore sand transport rate in the order of 1 million m3 per year (moving from west to east). The port facility initially blocked the full amount of sand transported along the shore, resulting in accumulation of a large beach on the updrift (west) side of the port and corresponding dramatic erosion of the downdrift (east) shoreline consisting of over 400 m of shoreline retreat by 2003 (i.e. over approximately 40 years). Additionally, since 1998 sand started to bypass around the harbor breakwater into the entrance channel. Harbor entrance channel dredging requirements was escalating with almost 1.5 million m3 dredged between 1998 and 2002. At the time of port construction, the downdrift erosion was not a concern as the area was largely undeveloped. However, with the inevitable expansion of the city of Cotonou towards the east, the ongoing erosion started to destroy newly developed residential and commercial areas.

AB  - By means of the physical process-based modeling approache to computing coastal and estuarine hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, an integrated model system was developed to simulate tides, waves, currents, winds, sediment transport, and morphological changes in coastal and estuarine regions. This paper presents an overview of this integrated morphological process modeling system consisting of modules for simulating random wave deformations, tidal and shortwave-induced currents, sediment transport and morphological changes. The individual modules included in the integrated model system were validated by simulating hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes in laboratory experiements and field study cases. An example for model application to an estuary is presented to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in simulating comprehensive impacts of combined storm waves, typhoons (or hurricanes), river floods, sediment transport, and morphological changes in its coastal and estuarine area. This modeling system provides engineers and researchers with an efficient and effective numerical software package to facilitate better coastal erosion protection, flood and inundation prevention, coastal strom water management and infrastructure protection against hazardous storms, typhoons, and hurricanes.

AB  - Introduction Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS), comprising unique elements of geological, biological, and historical interest, is located on the central California coast approximately 60 km northwest of San Francisco. The National Seashore contains nearly 130 km of exposed and protected shorelines, spectacular coastal cliffs and headlands, lagoons, open grasslands, bushy hillsides, and forested ridges. Approximately 30 km of the shoreline are coastal-dune habitat that supports 11 federally listed species, including the threatened western snowy plover and the endangered plants Tidestrom's lupine (Lupinus tidestromii) and beach layia (Layia carnosa). The San Andreas Fault, a right-lateral strike-slip fault, trends northwest along the northeastern side of the park. Tomales Bay, which is straight, long, narrow, and shallow, runs along the northeastern boundary of PRNS. The Bay, which fills the northwestern end of a rift valley at the intersection of the San Andreas Fault with the coastline, is approximately 20 km long, 2 km wide, and 6 m deep with mountainous terrain to the southwest and rolling hills to the northeast. Tomales Bay is one of the cleanest estuaries on the West Coast. In winter, approximately 17,000 to 20,000 shorebirds inhabit Tomales Bay and Bodega Bay, which lies directly to the north. At the head of Tomales Bay, the Giacomini Ranch comprises 563 acres of pastureland currently being used for grazing dairy cattle. After more than 50 years of operation as a dairy, the National Park Service acquired the Giacomini property with the intention to restore most of it and the nearby Olema Marsh to tidal wetland. Restoration will add approximately 4% to the existing coastal wetlands in California. The project will return the headwaters of Tomales Bay and two major stream intersections to an intertidal marsh environment, enhancing habitat for both wildlife and fish populations and contributing to the long-term health of Tomales Bay. Prior to the establishment of the ranch, the area was primarily salt marsh that formed as the delta of Lagunitas Creek expanded into Tomales Bay. In converting the salt marsh to dairy land, levees and tide gates were constructed to prevent tidal incursion and stream flooding. Those levees have significantly altered the patterns of estuarine circulation and sediment deposition. To restore natural hydrologic processes within the area and to promote the return of ecological functions and processes, the levees will have to be breached or removed. Developing a successful restoration strategy requires knowledge of elevations within the pastureland and the range of water depths that can be expected from tidal, river, and wind action. In support of the restoration program, the USGS provides technical assistance to PRNS in the form of a scientific study focusing on understanding the physical processes that could affect the Giacomini wetland restoration. The study will yield scientific products that NPS resource managers can use in designing and implementing the restoration project. Research elements include: * Develop a Geodetic Control Network (GCN) throughout PRNS that meets the standards specified National Geodetic Survey data base (the NGS 'Bluebook'). The grid will allow this and future studies to be conducted to a precision commensurate with the expressed goals of PRNS. The survey will consist of three steps: (1) verify existing GPS control monuments in the area; (2) tie control monuments in the study areas to the GPS control monuments; and (3) establish NAVD88 elevations using a digital electronic level. * Conduct a detailed survey of the Giacomini site to produce an accurate topographic map of the property. The site survey can be coupled with on-site water-level measurements to produce an empirical flooding model. * Measure water level and wind regime at the Giacomini site. The water-level range is critical to determining the wetland types based on the elevation of the dairy

AB  - In intenidal areas,ofthe Indo-West-Pacific, foraging soldiercrabs create a disturbed sediment surface covered with pseudofaeca1 peIlets discarded during the feeding process. To investigate the impact of feeding activities of the soldiercrab Mictyris longicarpus (Latreille, 1806) on small infauna, field experiments were carried out in a tropical tidal flat of Northeast Australia. A comparison of meiofaunal abundances in undisturbed sediment and sediment deposited by soldiercrabs after flotation feeding indicated an uptake of certain meiofauna taxa. Significantly reduced numbers of nematodes, copepods and plaLIJelminthes were found both in LIJe pseudofaeca1 pellets discarded by crabs foraging on LIJe surface, and in LIJe sediment deposited as hummocks by subsurface feeding crabs. Ostracods and newly settled bivalve larvae were not separated during flotation feeding, but discarded wiLIJ the pellets. This indicated a soning of food items by their specific density during the flotation feeding process. A caging experiment showed signifieant increases in the abundance of ail meiobenthic taxa when soldiercrabs were excluded. Mechanical disturbance of LIJe sediment 10 simulate sediment scraping by the crabs had no impact on the meiobenthos. Foraging soldiercrabs are important predators on meiofauna and significantly modify the meiofaunal cornmunity in tropical tidal fla

AB  - The shallow, turbid water of the Delaware Bay Estuary is the second most navigated waterway in the USA behind the Mississippi River and experiences tropical and extratropical cyclones from June through April bringing high winds, storm surge, precipitation, and coastal change. Mapping coastal areas within the Delaware Bay is particularly difficult due to inherent environmental factors such as low underwater visibility (less than 1 m), rapid tidal current (greater than 1 m/s), changeable weather, and strong mid-latitude winds. This study utilized four sonar systems, two manned vessels, two autonomous vessels, three real-time kinematics global positioning systems (RTK GPS), two unmanned autonomous aerial systems, and satellite imagery to quantify subaerial and subaqueous volume and feature changes following storm events. The study site was located at Broadkill Beach, Delaware, a microtidal beach inside the Delaware estuary and outside the National Coastal Mapping Program survey area. Six storms (four tropical and two extratropical cyclones) from 2012 to 2018 were surveyed pre- and post-storm. Key insights in sensors and platforms proved unmanned aerial systems (UAS) orthomosaic resolution to be superior for mapping shoreline, profile, and dune toe changes, swash zone features such as cusps, wrack lines, and infrastructure damage to beach crossovers. Subaqueous platforms performed well for most storm events with RMSE of 0.23 m or less. This uncertainty, including subaerial uncertainty (max = 0.016 m), can be reduced with precise GPS systems and ground truthing of elevations through additional sensors like RTK GPS and subbottom profilers. No clear pattern emerged between accretion and erosion for tropical or extratropical cyclones (TC or ETC). Low-energy beaches are rarely studied and therefore open-coast relationships are transplanted to these environments. Storm responses of the site did not match expected traditional cross-shore transport models as beach orientation and storm wind direction most likely induced longshore transport out of the system. UAS orthomosaics were critical in identifying wrack lines and debris which altered subaerial transport patterns at this low-energy site. This work highlights the importance of irregular, small-scale features such as relic jetties, wrack lines, and local wind waves in estuarine sites when traditional open-coast theory would diminish these processes. More importance should be placed on the use of high-resolution imagery and elevation data over widely spaced profiles when monitoring and managing low-energy sites experiencing episodic storms such as TC and ETC to accurately assess processes, relationships, and morphologic response.

AB  - "Ecological Infrastructure (EI)" are defined as naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver valuable services to people, such as healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and nodes and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. On the other hand, natural disaster occur at the locations where habitat was reduced due to the changes of land use, in which the land was converted to the settlements and agricultural cropland. Hence, habitat loss and natural disaster are linked closely. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is as important for providing services and underpinning socio-economic development. Hence, ecological infrastructure is expected to contribute to functioning as ecological disaster reduction, which is termed Ecosystem-based Solutions for Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR). Although ecological infrastructure already exists in the landscape, it might be degraded, needs to be maintained and managed, and in some cases restored. Maintenance and restoration of ecological infrastructure is important for security of human lives. Therefore, analytical tool and effective visualization tool in spatially explicit way for the past natural disaster and future prediction of natural disaster in relation to ecological infrastructure is considered helpful. Hence, Web-GIS based Ecological Infrastructure Environmental Information System (EI-EIS) has been developed. This paper aims to describe the procedure of development and future application of EI-EIS. The purpose of the EI-EIS is to evaluate functions of Eco-DRR. In order to analyse disaster data, collection of past disaster information, and disaster-prone area is effective. First, a number of digital maps and analogue maps in Japan and Europe were collected. In total, 18,572 maps over 100 years were collected. The Japanese data includes Future-Pop Data Series (1,736 maps), JMC dataset 50m grid (elevation) (13,071 maps), Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map (325 maps), Digital Base Map at a scale of 2500 for reconstruction planning (808 maps), Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area (10 m land use) (2,436 maps), and Digital Information by GSI (national large scale map) (71 maps). Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map were analogue maps, and were scanned and georeferenced. These geographical area covered 1) Tohoku area, 2) Five Lakes of Mikata area (Fukui), 3) Ooshima Island (Tokyo), 4) Hiroshima area (Hiroshima), 5) Okushiri Island (Hokkaido), and 6) Toyooka City area (Hyogo). The European data includes topographic map in Germany (8 maps), old topographic map in Germany (31 maps), ancient map in Germany (23 maps), topographic map in Austria (9 maps), old topographic map in Austria (17 maps), and ancient map in Austria (37 maps). Second, focusing on Five Lakes of Mikata area as an example, these maps were integrated into the ArcGIS Online (R) (ESRI). These data can be overlaid, and time-series data can be visualized by a time slider function of ArcGIS Online.

AB  - When the U.S. Coast Guard gave the historic Ocracoke Island Lifesaving Station to the State of North Carolina, and it became the North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching (NCCAT), the change represented real opportunity for improvement to the historic site. One particular improvement was the recovery of the eroding section of Pamlico Sound shoreline behind the facility where years of wind and wave action were chewing their way landward toward the buildings. In a collaborative effort with NCCAT, the North Carolina Coastal Federation, and the North Carolina State Construction Office, Moffatt & Nichol engaged in the complex task of permitting, designing, and constructing a natural estuarine shoreline and tidal marsh complex to replace the eroding shoreline, which had been unsuccessfully armored against the advancing sound. The restoration project involved the design and construction of breakwater sills just off shore to dissipate wave energy, regrading of the gradual slope of a natural shore profile, and re-establishment of native shoreline marsh vegetation. The design also involved additional green amenities. An interpretive boardwalk and pier were constructed and future construction phases will include stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) on upland areas, such as bioretention cells and pervious parking areas. In addition, oyster habitat restoration and seeding are planned for the site. Execution of the project also involved substantive opportunities for outreach and education by using teacher volunteers to implement the marsh vegetation plantings. Construction thus far has resulted in restoration of approximately 300 feet of natural shoreline and two acres of coastal salt marsh aquatic habitat. This case study presentation will review the complex permitting, design and construction issues involved in this highly public project built in a sensitive marine environment. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In the battle to preserve land against the ravages of the sea man has created many inappropriate protection structures on the coast. Often the coastline which is being protected is, inherently, in dis-equilibrium with nature. When combined with the increased recreational usage of the coastal zone, the rise in sea level and the increased incidence of storms, accelerated erosion rates are often the result. The Environmentally Friendly Coastal Protection project, or ECOPRO for short, developed a coastal erosion assessment method for the non-specialist. It devised a system for optimizing erosion monitoring and developed a guide to select of an appropriate coastal protection response. The project results are contained in the ECOPRO Code of Practice. This 320-page guide explains the steps involved in assessing and monitoring coastal erosion problems, planning protective actions and evaluating their environmental impact. Prepared by the Offshore & Coastal Engineering Unit of Enterprise Ireland, it is the result of four years of work which was supported under the EU LIFE Programme and drew on expertise from Ireland, Northern Ireland and Denmark. This paper presents details of the project and the development of the Code.

AB  - Management of forest carbon (C) stocks is an increasingly prominent land-use issue. Knowledge of carbon storage in tropical forests is improving, but regional variations are still poorly understood, and this constrains forest management and conservation efforts associated with carbon valuation mechanisms (e.g., carbon markets). This deficiency is especially pronounced in tropical islands and low-lying coastal areas where climate change impacts are expected to be among the most severe. This study presents the first field estimate of island-wide carbon storage in ecosystems of Oceania, with special attention to the regional role of coastal mangroves, which occur on islands and coastal zones throughout the tropics. On two island groups of Micronesia (Yap and Palau), we sampled all above- and belowground C pools, including soil and vegetation, in 24 sites distributed evenly among the three major vegetation structural types: mangroves, upland forests, and open savannas (generally on degraded lands formerly forested). Total C stocks were estimated to be 3.9 and 15.2 Tg C on Yap and Palau, respectively. Mangroves contained by far the largest per-hectare C pools (830-1218 Mg C ha(-1)), with deep organic-rich soils alone storing more C (631-754 Mg C ha(-1)) than all pools combined in upland systems. Despite covering just 12-13% of land area, mangroves accounted for 24-34% of total island C stocks. Savannas (156-203 Mg C ha(-1)) contained significantly lower C stocks than upland forests (375-437 Mg C ha(-1)), suggesting that reforesting savannas where appropriate has high potential for carbon-based funding to aid restoration objectives. For mangroves, these results demonstrate the key role of these systems within the broader context of C storage in island and coastal landscapes. Sustainable management of mangrove forests and their large C stocks is of high importance at the regional scale, and climate change mitigation programs such as REDD+ could play a large role in avoiding deforestation of mangroves where this is a management objective.

AB  - <jats:p>The South China Sea, including the Vietnam Sea, is witnessing significant changes under the impact of both nature and man. These are the impacts of climate change and ocean change with "extreme" signs such as increasing storms, coastal floods, sea level rise, sea acidification, pollution and environmental incidents, ... occur thicker, more intense and irregular. Especially serious degradation of the environment and biodiversity of the sea, increasing environmental incidents, including oil spills, ... due to human impact. Especially the large-scale destruction of coral reefs, seagrass beds in island clusters off the South China Sea has been happening at a worrying rate. The destructive fishing activities of humans in the South China Sea have caused ecosystem degradation and the extinction of some species, such as sea turtles, some sharks and another species. Other fish, especially the giant mussel, the consequence is a decrease in the natural capital of the sea, leading too prolonged "ecological disturbances". The reserves of seafood in the Spratly region (of Vietnam) and the West Sea in the East Sea have decreased by about 19% compared to before 2017. Therefore, the improvement of marine environment quality, including biodiversity conservation and major marine ecosystems are to preserve marine natural assets, contributing to the implementation of Vietnam's green growth strategy and action plan. This is the path that Vietnam has chosen to both grow marine economy, adapt to climate change, and protect the environment both in the short and long term, towards sustainable development.</jats:p>

AB  - US Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) projects have reduced coastal vulnerability and helped communities anticipate and mitigate toward improved resilience. This study proposes the Coastal Resilience Index (CRI) to quantify storm damage reduction benefits due to beach restoration projects in the context of resilience. The CRI considers metrics of the beach and dune system and disturbance factors such as storm surge and waves, using five non-dimensional factors: Protective Elevation (PE), Volume Density (VD), Protective Width (PW), Crest Freeboard (CF) and wave run-up (WR). The CRI is the summation of these five non-dimensional factors. This study developed a geographic information systems (GIS) based tool to automatically extract morphologic features from historic profiles and profiles extracted from LiDAR data to quantify beach resilience over time.

Objectives of this study were to: (i) Compare soil Nitrogen [N], Phosphorus [P], Organic Carbon [OC], organic matter (SOM) and soil bulk density between living, hardened and natural shoreline to determine if soil present within living shorelines is comprised of higher SOM and lower bulk density, that encourage marsh growth, as compared to hardened shorelines. (ii) Use an experimental mesocosm to test the effect of shoreline substrate types (living vs hardened vs natural) and nitrogen loading (at four concentration 0, 12, 24, 36 ml) on the growth of Spartina alterniflora. No previous study has documented the growth of Spartina in response to inorganic N loading at various shoreline substrate types. My results show living shoreline has significantly lower soil bulk density [F 2, 138 = 10.79, p <0.01] and higher SOM content than hardened shoreline [F 2, 138 = 10.26, p <0.01]. Combinations of N addition decreased plant’s root-shoot ratio and resulted in increased dry shoot weight. These results indicate that living shoreline is capable of trapping sediments within the nearshore environment, contributing to vertical marsh accretion by accumulation of organic matter, in the face of sea level rise. Findings from this research provide insights to local government, planners, developers and consultants on the benefits of living shoreline structures for the purpose of best shoreline management practice.

AB  - Due to the role of nutrients as limiting agents for eutrophication in fresh water and marine estuaries and as a human health risk in drinking water, greater scrutiny of land use in urban areas is needed. Few studies have attempted to determine the contribution of individual land uses to water quality degradation in urban areas. A 40% urban, 332 ha watershed in Ithaca, NY was selected as the research site. Runoff collected from 98 precipitation events over a two-year period and three land uses was analyzed for ammonium NH 4+-N), and nitrate (NO3--N) and mass losses were calculated. Monitored land uses included fertilized lawns (FL), urban barren (UB) areas and wooded (FR) areas. Stream gauges were installed at the stream entrance to the urban area and the watershed outlet to monitor the impact of the urban land uses on stream water quality. A multivariate analysis of the data revealed that the FL land use had significantly higher (p<0.05) nitrogen (N) loss than the other land uses in areas with shallow soil and high runoff potential. On the deeper soil where runoff was low, the FL land use had significantly lower (p<0.05) N loss than the UB or FR land uses. Precipitation derived N inputs had an influence on N lost from all land uses in the watershed, while N measured in throughfall under the FR land use canopy was of the same order of magnitude as the N lost in runoff from these areas. As the stream flowed through the urban area there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in stream flow rates under storm conditions and a significant decrease (p<0.05) in stream flow rates under dry conditions when compared to the undeveloped upper watershed. Areally weighted N loads in the stream were as high, and in many cases significantly higher (p<0.05), from the undeveloped upper watershed than following streamflow through the urban area. This indicated that the urban area may be a N sink. The results demonstrate that it is imperative to assess land use performance both spatially and under varying climatic conditions in order to reduce surface water contamination. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The lower Mississippi River encompasses the 1,535-km reach extending from the confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. Waters of the lower Mississippi River have historically inundated vast areas of adjacent floodplain during spring flood pulses. Additionally, processes of land building within the river's deltaic plain supported vast forests and diverse freshwater and salt-marsh habitats. Flood pulses provided a mechanism of lateral exchange of energy and nutrients between the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, while sediment loads continually rebuilt and supported the deltaic plain. As human populations and agriculture expanded throughout the lower Mississippi Valley, construction of flood-protection levee systems and commercial navigational structures severely decreased the connectivity between the lower Mississippi River and its floodplain. The current lower Mississippi River floodplain is more than 90% reduced in area compared to historical conditions. Fluvial dynamics, which are the driving forces that stimulate floodplain function and create diverse habitats, appear to have been altered throughout approximately 80% of the river. As a result, the hydrograph, thermograph, sedimentation patterns, nutrient dynamics, and vegetation communities within the lower Mississippi River floodplain have experienced major changes through time, with many large alterations occurring during the past century. In addition, because most of the sediment load of the lower Mississippi River now enters the northern Gulf of Mexico, land building and associated processes are much reduced in the river's deltaic plain. This process has allowed intrusion of saltwater into coastal habitats, which has heavily impacted vegetation communities. This paper reviews the consequences of river modification to lower Mississippi River floodplain, current efforts towards restoring the floodplain and deltaic plain, and proposes future strategies towards restoring portions of the historical floodplain.

AB  - The distribution, contamination status, and ecological risks of heavy metals in Tahaddart estuary were investigated. 24 surface sediment samples and two cores were collected and analyzed for major (Al and Fe), heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn), and grain size composition. The heavy metals assessment was carried out using different environmental indices. The results indicated that the spatial distribution patterns of Al, Fe, and Zn were mainly determined by the distribution of the finer grained fraction (<63 mu m) in the sediment. In contrast, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb concentrations were controlled by anthropogenic activities (vehicular traffic from Highway Bridge and thermal power plant). The distribution of heavy metals in sediment cores showed an upward enrichment in heavy metals with high concentration found in the uppermost may related to the increasing in human activities. The pollution indexes confirmed that the Tahaddart estuary sediment was considerably to high contaminated by heavy metals near to different anthropogenic inputs. Similarly, the potential ecological risk index and the biological risk index present 21% probability of toxicity posing potential risk to the aquatic organisms. These results provide basic information that can be used to protect and improve the quality of this ecosystem.

AB  - During several years severe beach erosion was observed at the city of Conceição da Barra in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The beach erosion is caused by a gradual increase in littoral sediment transport towards North, which has caused a shift in the direction of the net littoral drift. A new shoreline protection scheme was developed and tested. The scheme is based on two main principles: 1) - Create a number of sub cells in which the shoreline can attain its equilibrium orientation and 2) - Enhance the volume of sand in each cell in order to allow the natural shoreline dynamics due to cross-shore sediment transport. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Ocean View Beach is located in the transition zone in the estuarine environment of the lower Chesapeake Bay. It is a unique location, given that it is exposed to a fetch to the north in the Bay environment and an eastern exposure to swell from the Atlantic Ocean. In the past 10 years, northeast storms (nor'easters) and hurricanes have significantly impacted this shoreline, resulting in erosion and loss of the frontal dune system. In an effort to mitigate erosion, a nearshore breakwater field was constructed with a total of 258,000m3 of sediment placed along a reach of 1.6 km. An intensive monitoring program was initiated in 2002 whereby surveys are performed biannually including: aerial photography, beach and nearshore surveys, and sediment sampling. A directional wave gage was installed in close proximity to the study area in 2006. This investigation documents performace of recent engineering projects, provides a characterization of local coastal processes based on monitoring data collected (through March 2008). © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - During the past four decades, research efforts directed toward reducing shell egg cholesterol content have centred on genetic selection or alteration of the laying hens' diet with various nutrients, natural products, non-nutritive factors, or pharmacological agents. However, the vast majority of these experimental approaches elicited only minimal changes (< 10%) at best or, as in the case of dietary azasterols and triparanol, resulted in the unacceptable replacement of yolk cholesterol by desmosterol. In contrast, when 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins'), garlic paste, or pharmacological amounts of copper were orally administered to chickens, yolk cholesterol levels were reduced by up to 46%, 32%, or 34%, respectively. The previous paper in this two-part series provided a justification for low-cholesterol egg production and reviewed cholesterol metabolism in the laying hen, avian embryonic cholesterol needs, and genetic and nutritional approaches to chicken egg cholesterol reduction. The present paper provides a comprehensive overview of the use of non-nutritive dietary factors and select pharmacological compounds as egg cholesterol-lowering agents, and discusses emerging strategies for lowering the cholesterol content of shell eggs. With the recent advances in avian genomics and transgenesis, it is anticipated that the greatest advances in the area of yolk cholesterol reduction will be attained through manipulation of key genes whose protein products mediate intestinal sterol absorption, hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein synthesis, and/or lipoprotein uptake by growing oocytes. However, the future commercial availability of low-cholesterol eggs produced by transgenic hens ultimately will be influenced by the nature of the regulatory environment for bioengineered foods, public acceptance, and economics.

AB  - The Lake River Industrial Site (LRIS), owned by the Port of Ridgefield (Port) in Ridgefield, Washington, USA, was home to a wood-treating facility from 1964 to 1993. The wetland habitat of Carty Lake immediately adjacent to the LRIS was found to be contaminated with dioxins and other wood-treating chemicals, likely a result of discharge from former stormwater outfalls. To inform the design of the cleanup action, Maul Foster and Alongi, Inc. (MFA) applied incremental sampling methodology (ISM) in wetland sediments. The ISM results were used to focus the active remediation to a limited area. MFA designed, permitted, and provided oversight for implementation of the remedial action, which involved temporarily dewatering and excavating sediment from 0.6 hectare of wetland. Through both careful design and an extensive grading effort, the restored wetland surface retained the nuanced topography and "pocket-habitats" of the preconstruction conditions. An approximately 550-meter-long failing bulkhead was also permanently stabilized in place by the construction of bioengineered soil embankments. The design and implementation also included significant landscape components; the wetland, transitional zones, and upland areas of the site were completely revegetated with native plant communities to provide wildlife habitat, prevent erosion, and restore culturally significant plants to an area historically used by Native American tribes. © ASCE.

AB  - This study uses the Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to evaluate sea-level-rise hazards of erosion and inundation, on coastal archaeological sites in Trinity Bay, Texas. The SLAMM model was used to simulate the effects of a 1.5-m sea-level rise in the study area from 2006 to 2100. The model incorporated 177 archaeological sites, wetland categories, marsh accretion, wave erosion and surface elevation change. Modeling indicates that about 5,500 hectares of marshlands will undergo large-scale conversion to unvegetated tidal flats or open water by 2100. Both accretion and inland migration will be insufficient to prevent large-scale losses of marshlands. Predicted erosion, on a site-by-site basis, is expected to affect 31% of archaeological sites by the end of the century. Predicted periods of inundation of archaeological sites were derived from ten years of tide data from a nearby tide gauge station, using NOAA’s Inundation Analysis Tool. Approximately 55% of archaeological sites in the study area are predicted to be inundated at least half the time by the year 2100. Both inundation and erosion are predicted to have significant detrimental effects on archaeological sites in the study area. The study demonstrates that SLAMM is a useful tool for predicting potential future sea-level rise hazards on coastal cultural resources. Model outputs will be useful to coastal management agencies charged with evaluating impacts of sea-level rise and targeting high-risk sites for mitigation efforts.

AB  - The maintenance of marsh platform elevation under conditions of sea level rise is dependent on mineral sediment supply to marsh surfaces and conversion of above- and below-ground plant biomass to soil organic material. These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to above-ground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, above-ground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important trade-off with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, above-ground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of below-ground biomass as the root to shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation.

AB  - Europe and many other countries all over the world are often surrounded by coastal defence systems (e.g. protective dunes and dykes) in order to protect coastal areas from threats of wave attack, storm surges and subsequent coastal floods. During moderate sea conditions, wave attack and coastal erosion is limited to nearshore areas and may only cause shore erosion. Under the same conditions, fresh groundwater, which is hydraulically interconnected with seawater, is in equilibrium with the laterally intruding seawaters. Such equilibrium prevails as long as the moderate sea level (MSL) and the hydrogeological conditions at the sea/land boundary are stationary. However, during extreme storm surges, the higher water levels may temporally threaten the coastal defence systems. In fact, shortwaves riding on the temporally rising sea level during storm surge events may directly runup, rundown and/or impact on barriers, possibly causing seaward erosion followed by lowering of barrier’s crest and hence wave overtopping or overflow through combined surge and waves. As a result, barriers may breach, inducing coastal inundation and subsequent vertical saltwater intrusion (VSWI) behind the breached barriers due to the vertical infiltration of inundating seawater into the fresh groundwater. In this study, a new integral physically based methodology is developed to reliably assess the possible implications of extreme storm surges on the safety of coastal barriers and the implications of possible breaching for contamination of coastal aquifers. The integral model is therefore capable to successively simulate breaching/overtopping of coastal barriers forced by storm surges as a hydraulic load, induced flood propagation in the hinterland and subsequent VSWI into coastal aquifers while considering the complexity of these processes and mutual interaction among them. The modelling methodology consists of an improved XBeach code (Roelvink et al., 2009) for hydro-morphodynamics unidirectionally coupled with the SEAWAT code (Langevin et al., 2008) for groundwater flow. The model is applied to a case study in northern Germany, showing that marine floods represent a serious threat to usability of coastal aquifers which are extremely important water resources. Outcomes of model application showed that a coastal flood event of a few hours may contaminate coastal aquifers for many decades, thus reducing the agricultural yield and hindering the sustainable development in coastal areas prone to coastal floods. This study represents, to the knowledge of the author, the first systematic research study that addresses the safety of natural coastal sandy barriers under extreme storm surge conditions together with the consequences of possible barrier breaching and overwash on subsequent flooding and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater. Moreover, it is probably the foremost study that attempts to mitigate storm-driven saltwater intrusion through the use and modelling of a subsurface drainage network. Besides improving the agricultural yield in coastal areas, the use of subsurface drainage network significantly reduces the natural remediation interval required for aquifers recovery after a coastal flood event. Moreover, it limits the vertical extent of the salt intrusion. The multiple flow domains and aspects discussed in this research make it a multi-disciplinary study that is quite relevant for the coastal engineering community, for flood risk managers, for coastal hydrologists, for groundwater suppliers as well as for sustainable development planners.

AB  - The set complex of methods for effectuation of the ecological monitoring of the anthropogenic impact areas as well as undisturbed was worked out by the authors. This method has been tested from 1997 to 2016 in Kostomukshsky State Nature Reserve. The typical part of northern forests of the European part of Russia and Rangifer tarandus fennicus is being protected. The reserve is part of the Finnish-Russian Friendship nature reserve. The Kostomuksha Mining and Processing Plant, the city of Kostomuksha, transboundary transport are the sources of the pollution there. That’s why the regular monitoring of forest reserve ecosystem conditions is obligated in order to estimate the level of anthropogenic influence and impact on them. The description of geographic parameters, soil and vegetation is carried on the reference ares of the reserve, soil samples are taken from the soil profiles every year. The acidity, texture, sulfur, mobile forms and total content of heavy metals are determined in the soil samples. Pinus sylvestris L., Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., mosses are chosen as biological indicators. The age and the degree of chlorosis pine needles, projective cover of epiphytic lichens are researched as well as the content of sulfur and heavy metals in plants. High moisture, dissected topography and diversity of soil-forming rocks cause the mosaic distribution of the plant communities and soil layer structure. The main types of soil are Podzolic and Histosol. A lot of data considering on the chemical composition of the reserve soil has been accumulated as the result of long-term researches. The soils are acidic and slightly acidic. The content of mobile forms of iron, manganese, chromium, copper, zinc and lead recoverable by acetate-ammonium buffer way in soils is small and generally below the maximum allowable concentration. Zinc content reaches 43 mg/kg. The average iron content varies from 7 to 136, maximum – 460 mg/kg. The average content of manganese is 60, maximum – 196 mg/kg. The total content of chemical elements in the soils obtained by ICP-AES method is characterized by a low content of cobalt, lead, copper, nickel, chromium and manganese; sufficient zinc (5-82 mg/kg), barium (68-466 mg/kg) and iron (1610-22750 mg/kg) compared with the average chemical composition of soils. The native flora is represented by the spruce. The main part of area is occupied by the coniferous forests, a quarter of the territory be the marshes. The relief location influences the accumulation of trace elements in plants. The highest concentration is on the hill tops and in the coastal zone of the lake. So the material which allows estimate ecological conditions of the reserve forests as well as its changing over the time has been collected. The complex of the environmental monitoring methods of the taiga zone has been worked out. The territory of Kostomuksha reserve can be used as a background for the anthropogenic load and pollution assessment. © SGEM2017. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Erosion of exposed shorelines often introduces large quantities of sediment into the stored waters of stormwater retention basins. This additional sediment load can minimize the water quality enhancement otherwise gained from settling. Through the use of shoreline vegetation, it is possible to reduce this shoreline erosion and to achieve additional water quality benefits.

AB  - Issue Title: Archaeology and Coastal Conservation The human history of coastal regions around the world has been under assault for decades, from forces that include dam building, coastal modifications, the destruction of wetlands, marine erosion, population growth and rampant development, looting, and other processes. Global warming will exacerbate the destruction of cultural resources in coastal zones through accelerated sea level rise, intensified storm cycles, and related coastal erosion. Although average global sea levels have been rising for 20,000 years, they slowed dramatically about 7,000 years ago. Rates of sea level rise now appear to be increasing rapidly due to growing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Global warming and rising seas, especially when combined with population growth and the implementation of measures designed to protect endangered coastal properties, threaten the deep maritime history of human migrations, settlement, and adaptations in coastal areas around the world. Ranging in age from the mid-Pleistocene to recent historic times, coastal archaeological sites contain invaluable data on ancient coastal societies, fisheries, and ecosystems. Archaeologists, historians, and other cultural resource managers must do more to anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of global warming, sea level rise, and coastal erosion on the long history of human maritime cultures.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The study of diversity and ecological-phytocenotic mapping of the vegetation cover was carried out at the key area located in the eastern part of the Echki-Dag mountain range in the territory of the Lisya Bay Reserve (Eastern Crimea). A generalization of the classification and ecological patterns of vegetation was carried out to create a legend for a large-scale ecological-phytocenotic cartographic model (at the scale of 1:10000). The ecological-geomorphological series and combinations of xerophytic and mesoxerophytic plant communities indicating erosion-denudation processes on different substrates of the underlying parent rocks were the thematic basis of the cartographic model. The developed legend is based on the units of vegetation of the association rank obtained using the Braun – Blanquet method combined into ecological series in accordance with their position on the gradients of the leading ecological factors as well as on the hierarchy of phytochories determined by the categories of erosion-denudation relief of coastal slopes. The resulting vegetation map demonstrates the main regularities of the regional phyto-diversity and serves as the basis for assessing the resource potential of vegetation, its landscape-stabilizing and nature conservation value. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Tuggerah Lakes are a barrier or wave-dominated estuary consisting of three interconnected shallow lagoons impounded by a coastal sand barrier. Sea level rose by about 120 m during the late Pleistocene to about present sea level at about 7900-7700 cal BP. Sea level continued to rise to +1.5 m by 7400 cal BP and persisted until about 2000 cal BP when it regressed to the present level. Throughout most of the early and mid-Holocene, Tuggerah Lakes had two entrances, one in Tuggerah Lake at The Entrance and another in Budgewoi Lake near Budgewoi. Sand completely blocked the entrance near Budgewoi and the remaining channel at The Entrance became ensconced on bedrock. Nevertheless, sandy flood-tidal deltas developed at both entrances, although currently inactive. Where rivers debouche into the lagoons, silt jetties or fluvial deltas have formed. Deep channels have been dredged through river-mouth bars, altering natural sedimentation patterns and the distribution of seagrasses. The geoheritage value of flood-tidal deltas and silt jetties needs to be determined for NSW estuaries so that the most significant can be protected appropriately.

AB  - In the geological context of the delta zone formed by the estuary of the River Paraiba, near São João da Barra, Rio de Janeiro State, LLX Açu Operacoes Portuarias S.A., a member of the EBX Group, is planning the construction of a large-scale seaport: Superporto Do Açu. Owing to the generally poor subsoil conditions, an intensive near-shore geotechnical Site Investigation (SI) campaign was carried out in order to determine the most appropriate breakwater typology. Core-barrel rotary drillings and CPTUs up to 50 m below the seabed were performed from a jack-up platform deployed from Europe to the work site specifically for this project. Water depth varies from 13.8 to 18.1 metres. Laboratory tests were also carried out on high-quality undisturbed samples. This paper presents the outcomes of the SI campaign and sets out the alignment with standard correlations for Quaternary submarine near-shore delta soils in Brazil.

AB  - ABSTRACT Escudero, M.; Silva, R., and Mendoza, E., 2014. Beach erosion driven by natural and human activity at Isla del Carmen Barrier Island, Mexico. The study site is located on the Gulf of Mexico and is part of the most valuable lagoon-estuarine system in Mexico, not only in ecological terms but also as an important economic and social site for the country. Although the current state of the environment is still reasonably healthy over much of its area, the natural equilibrium has been greatly affected by human activities, as in many of other coastal lagoons worldwide (e.g., infrastructure and building construction, installation of inappropriately designed defense structures, degradation of vegetation and an artificial lagoon opening). The consequence is a sediment deficit that, combined with the impact of tropical cyclones and the absence of an external sand supply, has led to persistent beach erosion. The analysis of the physical settings, historical shoreline changes and hydrodynamic patterns of the ...

AB  - This article discusses whether managed realignment (MR) is a sustainable strategy able to deliver the expected environmental and socio-economic benefits in England. Assessing the sustainability of MR is problematic, as data on projects' performance are scarce, of restricted dissemination and limited in scope and geographic coverage. The few existing independent studies indicate a number of constraints including: reduced biodiversity in small realignment sites; new saltmarsh development at the expense of established habitats; poor ecosystem services provision; and lack of understanding about the effects of MR on hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes. There is little evidence so far that MR in England is achieving its strategic aims. Realignment sites are usually small, confined by new defences and located within or adjacent to designated conservation areas, where conflicts arise as designated freshwater habitats might be destroyed to give place to intertidal habitats. As sea level continues to rise, it is just a matter of time for coastal squeeze to affect the newly created intertidal habitats.

AB  - The mangrove forest is important in shoreline stabilization and as a nursery for many open ocean species. Complex adaptations of the plants for existence in anaerobic conditions and salt water make the mangrove forest highly vulnerable to oil pollution. Clearly, advance protection of mangrove forests is the optimal solution to minimize oil pollution damage. The more difficult question remains: What can be done to minimize the impact of oil that has entered fringe mangrove forests? Active flushing of mangroves and passive oil collection by absorbents are moderately successful in minimizing oil contact with mangroves.

This paper systematically analyzed impacts resulting from the change of various factors such as sediment and hydrodynamics conditions, pointed out the major reason resulting in the increase on the amount of back-siltation in the middle reach, and discussed engineering measurements to reduce the siltation. The engineering effects of the measures were evaluated after the constructions as well.

AB  - Much is known about wave attenuation across sandy nearshore environments or coral reef platforms. Limited field work has aimed to measure and assess attenuation across rock platforms. We designed and implemented a field experiment at Belinho, Portugal, to address this need. Field work was conducted in June, 2006, over a sequence of five tidal cycles. Researchers deployed a shore-normal array of seven KPSI pressure transducers, installed 0.15 m above the bed and spaced between 10 and 15 m apart, to measure surface water levels. When all instruments were submerged by the rising tide, they were sampled at 20Hz. The instrument array spanned the inter-tidal platform composed of schist. The surface, about 70 m wide, is irregular and cut by many shore perpendicular channels. To assess the attenuation and transformation of waves across this surface as a result of shoaling and breaking, researchers have derived spectral estimates of wave height and period through each high tide series.

AB  - ABSTRACT The French organization of onshore oil spill response is defined by specific intervention plans (Polmar plans), established for every coastal department. One of the main elements of these plans consists of detailed plans for deploying booms to protect sensitive areas. The Ministry of the Sea, with assistance from CEDRE, carries out exercises every year in different coastal locations to test the feasibility and efficiency of the boom deployment plans and also to train local personnel in handling antipollution equipment. Lessons learned from these exercises enable the improvement of deployment plans and help define new research areas. Within this framework, CEDRE has undertaken a feasibility study for the installation of booms in high tidal range and strong current areas. This experimental study involved a 15-day period, during the autumn of 1993, of on-site observations on the behavior of booms installed in one of the most difficult sites on the Atlantic shoreline. The main parameters observed were resistance, containment efficiency, and mechanical behavior of booms during the tide cycle, particularly when booms are stranded at low tide. In spite of successful boom installation, the experiment encountered difficulties due to meteorological and instrumentation problems. Nevertheless, important lessons have been learned.Static boom protection seems to be difficult for such sites, which leads us to question the validity of numerous Polmar plans. We should test alternative response techniques such as dynamic recovery systems set up at the openings to sensitive areas, which will necessitate good coordination between at-sea and on-shore response authorities.Mooring systems design and installation are jobs for specialists and should be prepared in advance.Various local means, such as fishing vessels or oyster farm barges, can be used for deploying protective booms.

AB  - Accurate evaluation of wave run-up on beaches is a critical issue for coastal flooding studies. During extreme events, the maximum wave run-up, caused by very long (frequently non-breaking) waves, may exceed the crest of the coastal protection structures or dunes and inundate the protected inland area. This event may be simulated by a flood propagation model, recently published by the authors, that solves a simplified form of the Shallow Water Equations (SWE). The simplification mainly consists of linearizing bottom friction and neglecting advection. This study investigates on the relevance of the latter terms and on the model ability in predicting wave run-up on impermeable beaches. Numerical simulations of run-up induced by solitary non-breaking waves on a gentle-sloping planar beach are compared to the results found by Synolakis (1987) on the basis of an experimental study. For the numerical simulations, only 21 tests of the 40 experiments carried out by Synolakis (i.e. all the non-breaking waves) are considered. A good agreement between the numerical and the experimental maximum run-up was found for all the tested waves. In order to verify the magnitude and the effects of the advection terms in the SWE, some simulations are repeated considering and neglecting this term. The hypothesis of neglecting convective terms is found appropriate. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - Isles Dernieres is a transgressive barrier island arc in southeast Louisiana associated with the Bayou Grand Caillou headland of the Lafourche delta complex, which was abandoned 600 to 800 years ago. During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the goal is to identify the soil properties in restored marsh that could be modified to enhance back-barrier marsh habitat. Laboratory analyses of 60 cores from four different vegetation density classes in restored marsh and nine cores from natural marshes included bulk density, soil moisture content, grain size, sorting, pH, conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Vegetation density in restored marshes had no significant effect on soil properties, with the exception of bulk density. Marsh type had a significant effect on all measured soil properties. Variations in the soil properties of restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh are primarily the result of differences in soil texture and elevation.

AB  - To assess coastal storm risks this paper compares existing hazards, associated risks, coastal management plans, and civil protection schemes from nine European countries. An evaluation made of specific study sites concludes that: (a) the definition of coastal hazard or risk varies between countries, regions and sites with no pan-European agreement; (b) existing risk definitions for northern Europe are based on probabilistic approaches and integrate threats to human occupation; this approach is not adopted in southern and eastern European countries; (c) half of the evaluated coastal management plans have a scientific basis with the remainder adopting qualitative or semi- quantitative approaches; (d) strategic approaches, used to define areas of potential occupation, coastal defences etc. are the most common; (e) operational approaches used for major event prediction and response are poorly developed. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate existing best practices in Europe in order to develop standardised coastal risk management for all EU member states.

AB  - The collapse of the Atlantic cod fishery in the 1990s devastated the economies of many coastal Newfoundland communities. While many have survived through a combination of a much reduced fishery, government funding, and off shore or out of province employment, none of these are sustainable long-term solutions. Sea-based aquaculture ('fish farming' in pens) has provided stable employment in some areas, but only where there are suitable sites with protected, deep inlets with significant tidal or river current flushing. These geographic characteristics are not usually compatible with prosecuting the inshore fishery. Sites that were close to the open fishing grounds with minimal near shore currents were prized by the small boat fishers, but wind and wave protection were a secondary concern. Thus there are many towns and villages that are significant distances from ideal sea-based aquaculture sites. While shore-based aquaculture would be possible in many coastal villages, the profitability of the industry is limited by the cost of pumping water to and through the shore based infrastructure. Many existing coastal settlements do have an abundance of energy available in ocean waves. The harnessing of this energy to pump water on shore at low cost will enable the development of profitable shore based aquaculture methods that will provide sustainable long-term economic activity for these communities. Shore-based aquaculture has the additional possibility of containing and directing effluent from the production on one species to another that can use it as a feed source (e.g., fish effluent delivered to filter feeders). This effectively 'biofilters' the fish production effluent while producing other marketable product (scallops and seaweed, for example) at little or no extra cost. This paper reports on a research project being conducted by College of the North Atlantic (CNA) in Lord's Cove, Newfoundland, which has the overall goal of developing a sustainable land-based aquaculture system utilizing wave energy. Development of the pump is occurring concurrently with the design, installation and commissioning of a pilot cascaded Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) facility in Lord's Cove. In this pilot farm, the effluent from the finfish (the only organisms receiving external feed input) is directed to sea urchin production tanks. From there, water flows to scallop production tanks and finally algae culture. The algae produced is fed to the urchins, who consume this and organic sediment coming from the finfish. The suspended organic particulate in the urchin effluent will nourish the sea scallops, and the algae will reduce the dissolved inorganic load before the water is returned to the ocean (Fig. 1). Until the wave pump development is complete, water for the farm is being entirely supplied by electric pumping. We are currently undergoing scale model and sea based prototype testing of the wave driven pump. As part of the design process for this pump, the wave energy resource and bathymetry at the site was measured and documented. As a result of these activities, CNA now operates the Wave Energy Research Centre (Fig. 2). This facility is now permitted for testing of wave energy absorbers and similar devices: it includes data acquisition (wave environment, weather and device performance monitoring) as well as the necessary infrastructure to support these studies and is ready to host other device developers. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Coastal dunes can protect communities and infrastructure against storm surge and wave attack. They provide a natural barrier of granular material that erodes during storm conditions and dissipates wave energy in the process. Vegetation is abundantly present in most coastal dunes and may enhance the capability of the dune to withstand erosion. However, reliable data allowing quantification of the erosion process of dunes are sparse, in particular, data involving live plants. In this study, physical model experiments in a moveable-bed wave flume were carried out to investigate the effect of live plants on the wave-induced dune erosion process. The dune grass Sporobolus virginicus was grown in pots with dune sediment, transplanted into test dunes and subjected to both regular and irregular wave attack. Measurements of hydrodynamics and profile evolution show that the vegetation does affect the eroded dune volume and the dune scarp retreat rate. During wave flume testing vegetation density ranged from 0 to 80 plants per square meter and plant maturity (i.e. age) was varied between 0 and 12 weeks but further tests are necessary to substantiate the observed trends. The maturity of the plants' root system yielded the most significant impact on dune erosion as plants with more developed roots were able to reduce the eroded dune volume more than plants with less mature root systems.

AB  - Because of the large volumes of sand required for beach renourishment, dredging from offshore borrows is the preferred method of sediment supply. As easily accessible and previously known (obvious) deposits are exploited, apparent I sand reserves are seen as a dwindling resource that becomes more precious over time. Because economically exploitable offshore sand sources are limited in many regions, renewed efforts are underway to locate additional offshore sand sources that can supply sand and mixed sediments (sand, silt, and clay) to barrier-island restoration efforts in Louisiana. Sediment volumes required for beach renourishment and marsh restoration are variously estimated on the basis of numerous assumptions to range in the extreme from 14 X 10(6) m(3) to 71 X 10(6) m(3), respectively, for one complete restoration of the entire barrier island chains. Although estimates of required volumes are controversial, significant new borrow sites must be located on the continental shelf off Louisiana to restore the barrier islands. The search for new sand sources must be focused on logistical procedures that are economical and efficient in order to cover large areas of the shelf in a timely manner. Sand search protocols developed for US East Coast sedimentary environments are broadly applicable in a conceptual sense but need to be adapted to deltaic coastal frameworks in Louisiana. Procedures and protocols for the Delta Sand Search Model (DSSM) are thus based on bathymetric, geophysical, and geotechnical survey recommendations for the identification of targets that will be proven out by detailed studies and cultural resource investigations. Development of a DSSM has advantage because it is specifically adapted to coastal marine morphosedimentary units in different-aged lobes of the Mississippi Delta that have fine-grained (muddy) deposits interspersed by sandy deposits of paleodistributaries and interdistributaries.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) recently estimated that global sea level will rise from 0.18 to 0.59 m by the end of this century. Rising sea level not only inundates low-lying coastal regions but also contributes to the redistribution of sediment along sandy coasts. Over the long term, sea-level rise (SLR) causes barrier islands to migrate landward while conserving mass through offshore and onshore sediment transport. Under these conditions, coastal systems adjust to SLR dynamically while maintaining a characteristic geometry that is unique to a particular coast. Coastal marshes are susceptible to accelerated SLR because their vertical accretion rates are limited and they may drown. As marshes convert to open water, tidal exchange through inlets increases, which leads to sand sequestration in tidal deltas and erosion of adjacent barrier shorelines.

AB  - ABSTRACT A three-year study (July 1974 to July 1977) of Price Inlet, South Carolina, monitored inlet hydraulics and channel morphology. The inlet is strongly ebb-dominant. Both the peak and mean current velocities during ebb exceed the corresponding velocities during flood. The velocity asymmetry is caused by changes in inlet efficiency during the tidal cycle. The intertidal marsh of the Price Inlet drainage area experiences a change in open water surface area of about 670 percent during an average tidal cycle. At high tide, the large water surface of the marsh is responsible for inefficient exchange of water through the inlet. This causes a long time lag between ocean and bay tides. The small surface area of open water in the marsh at low tide, on the other hand, yields nearly no time lag. These differential time lags cause longer flood durations than ebb durations in the inlet throat and, consequently, stronger ebb elocities. Monitoring of the cross-sectional flow area of the inlet throat demonstrates rapid adjustment to changing flow conditions. The 1159 m2 cross sectional area of the inlet throat varied as much as 8.3 percent during one tidal cycle. The cross sectional area varied in phase with the tidal range. Long-term changes in the dimensions of the channel appear to be a direct result of changes in the size of ebb-tidal delta shoals. During the study period, the growth of the linear bars in the channel margin gradually reduced wave energy along the inlet shoreline and on the inner ebb-tidal delta platform. This in turn reduced sediment transport into the inlet, which resulted in a gradual increase in the cross-sectional area of the channel. Seasonal fluctuations in mean sea level appear t have little effect on the inlet channel.

AB  - Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke) operates the Dillsboro Hydroelectric Project under a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC No. 2602). The Project is located on the Tuckasegee River in southwestern North Carolina in the Town of Dillsboro, Jackson County. The development consists of a small reservoir of limited storage (15 acres in size), dam and powerhouse, and a small amount of adjacent shoreline land. Duke has proposed to surrender the License and subsequently remove the dam and powerhouse as part of Settlement Agreements addressing continued operation of Duke's East Fork and West Fork Projects, as well as the Nantahala Project. This Settlement Agreement was signed by Duke, along with 20 of the 22 stakeholders including all the pertinent state and federal agencies and filed with FERC in January 2004. The removal of the dam would provide mitigation for fish passage at the aforementioned projects and instream flow relief at specific bypassed reaches within the East Fork, West Fork, and Nantahala Projects. The dam removal would allow full aquatic and recreational access to an additional 9.5 miles of river and ultimately restore 4,220 feet of the river to its original condition and elevation. FERC stated in their Surrender Order that the Project would have short-term environmental impacts, significant environmental benefits, and would be in the public interest. However, this potential success story is not without its regulatory, environmental, and engineering challenges. Before the dam and powerhouse are removed, several environmental conditions needed to be addressed and state and federal permits obtained. Foremost of these challenges was the location of several populations of federally endangered mussels immediately downstream of the dam. Before the dam is removed, Endangered Species Act (ESA) section 7 approval by the USFWS was required before the mussels could be relocated upstream to a suitable site. Other environmental challenges include removal of 70,000 cubic yards of sediment from the impoundment (of a total of 100,000 cubic yards) and the associated state dredging permit approval. In addition to the FERC surrender order, section 401 water quality certification, several section 404 nationwide permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a NPDES permit, and several years of pre-removal monitoring are also required before the dam can be removed. With the removal of the powerhouse, over 500 little brown bats are to be removed and relocated to nearby constructed bat boxes. Engineering challenges include the staged removal of a cyclopean concrete dam, removal of the Powerhouse, sediment removal, bank stabilization, and an immediately adjacent and potentially affected State road, fiber optic cable, and sewer line. There have been several legal challenges associated with the removal of the dam. Three years of postremoval monitoring are also required by the agencies and is a condition of the section 401 certification. In spite of these challenges and conditions, the dam and powerhouse are currently slated to be removed in January 2010.

AB  - The Pontchartrain Basin extends over 44,000 km(2) from northern Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and includes one of the largest and most important estuarine systems in the United States. The basin supports a variety of environments, from woodlands in the north to wetlands in the south, and a growing socioeconomic infrastructure that has led to rapid development of the southern half of the basin over the past two centuries. To properly administer this infrastructure, managers need to understand the complex geologic framework of the basin and how it will respond to continued sea-level rise, variable rates and magnitudes of land subsidence, and human alteration of the landscape. This article summarizes the body of work that describes the regional evolution and stratigraphic architecture of the Pontchartrain Basin. The northern two-thirds of the basin is underlain by a stratigraphy of undifferentiated sands and clays deposited throughout the Plio-Pleistocene by glacially influenced rivers. These deposits were weathered and incised by rivers during sea-level low stands, forming a series of terraces that increase with age from south to north. The southern third of the basin is composed of estuaries formed during the Holocene, while shoreline processes created a series of sandy barriers that restricted communication to the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River completed the geologic development of the basin by building a sequence of subdelta lobes along this southern margin over the past 5000 years, further sealing it from the open Gulf of Mexico. Presently, the modern Mississippi River bypasses the estuarine environment and only contributes sediments during flood events when the river overtops the levee system. Sea-level rise, subsidence within the Holocene delta-plain deposits, and movement along numerous fault systems are the active natural processes that continue to affect basin geomorphology.

AB  - Europe has recently faced several major industrial accidents generated by various causes. They have led to a lot of casualties and major damages to the environment (Enschede 2000, Toulouse 2001, Ath 2004...). Moreover, after the 9/11th people have stressed the influence of terrorism in the emergence of new risks. Geopolitical context has brought about risks which cannot be completely avoided. It is illustrated by many events: Sarin Attack, Anthrax Letters, USS Cole and Limburg attacks, drinking water contamination, action on industrial sites...Regarding SEVESO establishments and similar critical infrastructures like ports and marshalling yards, these concerns are not included in the safety report required by the Authorities. In this paper, the authors establish, in the first part a brief inventory of the available methodologies and tools in order to elaborate a threat assessment. Then in the second part, they formulates some suggestions to integrate security aspects in a risk assessment, to globalise prevention and response approach in case of chemical accident or intentional acts on chemical sites. An example of the adaptation of the ARAMIS methodology is explained in the last part. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Projected rates of global sea level rise and human pressures have increased attention to the potential for landform change in estuaries. This paper assesses the status of the fetch-limited beaches in the Tagus estuary, one of the largest estuaries in Europe, with a focus on distinguishing active beaches from inactive vegetated banks and identifying conditions under which they change state. A total of 26 beaches were identified in the inner estuary and 49 in the tributary basins on 2007 aerial photographs and compared with conditions on older photographs (1944-1958). Lengths, widths and maximum fetch distances for beaches were measured and site visits were made to determine their origins and present conditions. Beaches occur at eroding uplands or marshes or on spits extending from eroding uplands. Human-created beaches occur on spoil areas, within niches formed by structures and where vegetation is eliminated or prevented from colonizing (e.g. boat launches and recreational surfaces). Basin infilling, with increase in the elevation of low tide terraces and the formation of bars, is reducing wave energies, and some beaches are reverting to vegetated banks. Beaches that become vegetated banks because of human actions occur where use for boating or recreation is abandoned and where spits that form off spoil deposits reduce fetch distances upwind. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Cohesive sediment recharge has considerable potential as a means of restoring estuarine shores on account of the large volumes of mud raised through maintenance dredging. However, few direct foreshore placements of muddy material have been undertaken to date. This paper evaluates a pioneering sediment recharge in the Orwell estuary (eastern UK), along a degraded mud-gravel foreshore backed by a seawall protecting agricultural land. Recharge was undertaken in December 1997 and involved placement of a retaining bank of potentially mobile gravel, which was filled with 22 x 10(3) m(3) muddy maintenance dredgings. Morphodynamic behaviour of the mud and gravel deposits over a 10 year period has been dominated by in situ dewatering and compaction of the mud, landward reworking of the enclosing gravel, and partial return of the mud to the wider estuarine system. Landward 'roll over' of the gravel has reduced the width of the newly created mudflat by around 60%, such that this is now only 15 to 25 m wide. However, top-up recharges of mud in 2000 and 2003 raised elevations to the extent that around 80% of the mud area has been colonized by a diverse community of saltmarsh halophytes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct placement of cohesive dredge material on low wave energy estuarine foreshores as a means of reducing damage to flood defence infrastructure and restoring degraded mud flat and saltmarsh habitats over a decadal timescale.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have disproportionately high carbon densities, known as blue carbon, compared to most terrestrial ecosystems. Mangroves and their blue carbon stocks are at risk globally from land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC) activities such as aquaculture, alongside biophysical disturbances such as sea‐level rise and cyclones. Global estimates of carbon emissions from mangrove loss have been previously unable to differentiate between the variable impacts of different drivers of loss. This article discusses the impacts that different LULCC activities and biophysical disturbances have on carbon stocks (biomass and soil) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4). The dynamics of carbon stocks and fluxes depends on the type of LULCC; aquaculture often results in biomass and soil carbon removal, and some forms of agriculture can substantially increase methane emissions. Natural disturbances have mixed impacts on mangrove carbon; sea‐level rise will drown some mangroves and their carbon stocks but provide opportunities for new carbon accumulation, while cyclones can have immediate negative impacts on stocks but positive impacts on sequestration during recovery. Mangrove rehabilitation practices can actively restore carbon stocks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from previous land uses. It is critical to consider the type of LULCC when estimating carbon emissions due to mangrove loss or rehabilitation. Mangrove blue carbon is now high on the international conservation policy agenda, and a better understanding of how carbon stocks and fluxes respond to anthropogenic and biophysical disturbance may provide better incentives for mangrove conservation and sustainable management.

AB  - The tidal River Elbe, northern Germany, serves as an important international waterway feeding the port of Hamburg and thus indicates its function as a significant economic lifeline for that region. At the same time the estuarine riverscape is a valuable natural habitat, protected by national and European legislation. In recent centuries the estuary has been impacted by manmade changes, e.g. by ongoing river training. There are very limited data about the dynamic interaction between soils, sediment transport and budgets as well as vegetation development. This article compiles ongoing Elbe research that includes: (i) the response of tidal reeds and invasive plants to shifts in hydrodynamics and land use; (ii) the resilience of bank sediments against hydro-mechanical stress; and moreover (iii) the analyses of socio-economic aspects in the context of bank restoration by applying the approach of ecosystems services.

AB  - In March, 1981, Amoco Production Company constructed an exploration drilling pad on No Name Island, a natural barrier island located 14 miles northeast of Prudhoe Bay in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. A monitoring program was initiated at No Name Island to determine the nature and extent of island change in response to the natural environmental forces active at the site. Two field surveys were conducted during the 1981 open-water season, the first in July and the second in September. Additionally, historical survey records and aerial photographs were investigated to determine long-term processes of island change. The most significant changes observed between July and September, 1981, include island migration, island coalescence, and shoreline fluctuation. Although partially sheltered on its northern side by Cross Island, No Name Island exhibited changes similar to those observed on other Arctic barrier islands having more exposed locations. At least two episodes of island breaching occurred between 1979 and 1981. The largest breach occurred near the northern end of the island and measured 300 feet in width. A smaller breach near the island midpoint has partially healed as a result of filling by littoral drift. Between 1979 and 1981, No Name Island migrated southward at an average rate of 75 feet/year. On a long-term basis, the southward migration between 1949 and 1980 averaged 60 feet/year. The net littoral drift accounting for the observed long-term rate of migration is estimated to be approximately 50,000 cubic yards/year. Shoreline fluctuations adjacent to the drilling pad between July and September, 1981, measured 10 to 15 feet on both the east and west shores. These fluctuations were accommodated within the 30-foot wide beach-front margin which was specifically avoided as a site for the drilling pad foundation due to its unstable nature. The recent history of No Name Island indicates the potential for dramatic short-term changes in both island shape and location. Cognizance of the major natural processes at work, provided by the monitoring program, will promote the proper design of future operations on the island while preserving the integrity of the island's natural environment. © 1982 Offshore Technology Conference.

AB  - High-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of dry-fallen intertidal flats in the German Wadden Sea have been analyzed with respect to the imaging of sediments, macrophytes, and mussels. A large number of high-resolution TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images of five test areas along the German North Sea coast were acquired in 2012 and 2013 and form the basis for the present investigation. Depending on the type of sediment, but also on the water level and on environmental conditions (wind speed) exposed sediments may show up on SAR imagery as areas of enhanced, or reduced, radar backscattering. The (multi-temporal) analysis of series of such images allows for the detection of mussel beds, and our results show evidence that also single-acquisition, multi-polarization SAR imagery can be used for that purpose.

AB  - As climate change accelerates the dynamism of natural processes, its impacts are likely to be most keenly felt in the coastal zone where littoral communities may face an increasing risk of both erosion and flooding. As a response to climate change the primary mechanism on a geopolitical scale has been one of mitigation, as an attempt to reduce the anthropogenic causes at its root. However, perceived limitations of this approach led Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to agree in Bali, 2007 that the alternative approach of adaptation should play a significantly greater role in the future global response, and this is now embedded as one of the post 2012 pillars. There is evidence of adaptation already taking place but this is currently piecemeal in nature, with research showing distinct challenges and barriers to its introduction. Nevertheless, enhanced vulnerability facing coastal communities requires novel solutions to enable its implementation, thus allowing for a more strategic approach to ensure that timely and effective measures are taken, and to ensure coherence across different sectors and levels of governance. The research presented in this paper is concerned with exploring the capacity of coastal areas to adapt to change in terms of policy, spatial planning and development options, and is geographically focussed on the Solent. This estuarine complex is an area of coast likely to be particularly vulnerable to coastal change since it is densely populated, low-lying and highly contested by a range of competing interests. It is also likely to include specific areas defined as Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMAs) that will not be protected by any new measures; hence requiring communities to adapt. The paper will outline an EU Interreg IVa - 2 seas funded project entitled 'Coastal Communities 2150 and Beyond' (CC2150), and in particular its application in the Solent. On the basis of vulnerability and coastal risk, this project is aimed at informing communities of predicted climate change impacts in order that they might be empowered to find proactive responses to the problem of coastal change. Central to this is the need to communicate science and build capacity within coastal areas, so as to enable effective planning, the conclusions of which are horizontally transferrable to other vulnerable areas of the UK coast and beyond.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this field study was to evaluate bioremediation and phytoremediation in restoring an oil-contaminated freshwater shoreline. Weathered Mesa light crude oil was released intentionally onto small plots in the upper intertidal zone of a study site located along the St. Lawrence River. Treatments were established to examine the effect of nutrient addition and the role of plants (Scirpus pungens) on the removal of oil constituents from the contaminated plots. Fertilizers under evaluation included sodium nitrate, prilled ammonium nitrate, and triple super phosphate. Composite core samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 weeks for identification of remaining oil constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To account for differences because of physical washout, all oil constituents were normalized to the conservative biomarker hopane. Although bioremediation and phytoremediation treatments achieved slightly better degradation of hydrocarbons than natural attenuation, no statistically significant evidence of stimulation through addition of nutrients or biodegradation enhancement by vegetation was observed. After 21 weeks, reduction of target parent and alkyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) averaged 32% in all treatments. Reduction of target alkanes was of similar magnitude. The pattern of disappearance of hydrocarbons was characteristic of biodegradation: namely, the lower molecular weight alkanes declined to a greater extent than the higher carbon-number alkanes, as did the lower molecular weight PAHs compared to the higher molecular weight PAHs. Since there was little evidence supporting enhancement of biodegradation by nutrient addition with and without vegetation, it was concluded that oxygen limitation most likely dominated the persistence of oil hydrocarbons on the oil-contaminated plots.

Pluri-decadal impact of mining activities on coastline mobility of estuaries of New Caledonia (South Pacific) This work aims at analysing the relative impact of sedimentary supply by rivers versus the effect of sea level rise and other processes over the last 5 decades of some representative coastal stretches of New Caledonia (South Pacific Ocean). The study of twelve coastal estuarine stretches has shown erosion rates ranging from −1.8m/y to accretion rates up to 5.5m/y over the last 50 years. During this time, the climate component of sea level rise has been evaluated around 0.5mm/y in Noumea and can be considered identical on the studied island. Vertical movements affecting New Caledonia are suspected to be different between western and eastern parts of the island. Nevertheless, in areas with homogeneous vertical movement, the coastal stretches studied show various evolution rates. The analysis of accreting e...

AB  - Smooth-shelled blue mussels of the genus Mytilus have long been a major focus of research because such mussels have an interesting global (antitropical or bipolar) distribution, have a complex phylogeographic history, are ecosystem engineers, are economically important as an aquaculture product, are very successful as bioinvaders, hybridise readily both naturally and after accidental introduction, and have a complex and still incompletely resolved taxonomy. Historically, most research has been focussed on Northern hemisphere mussels, and investigation has spanned a range of different methodological approaches that have set the foundation for our current understanding of the global situation. However, research into native blue mussels in the Southern hemisphere has tended to lag behind that in the Northern hemisphere. The result has been that native Southern hemisphere mussels have often been viewed only in the perspective of their Northern hemisphere congeners. Recently, however, the application of new molecular markers - single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs - has substantially improved our understanding of the taxonomy of Southern hemisphere blue mussels, their biogeography and indirectly their evolutionary histories. Based largely on new SNP surveys of native and non-native blue mussels from all major Southern hemisphere regions, we highlight the need for recognition of distinct species that are consistent with a large body of evidence, both SNP-based and other, and can be understood in the context of Southern hemisphere oceanography. We also highlight with the new SNPs-based data the ongoing difficulty of agreeing on what constitutes a distinct species by emphasising different interpretations of the data, and discussing how the use of species delimitation models may remove some of the qualitative assessment that is so often applied to the problem. The recognition of new species has implications for management, including the identification of bioinvasive mussels, the conservation of native genetic diversity, aquaculture production statistics, food labelling and traceability. © 2021 CRC Press.

AB  - ABSTRACT In April 1986, more than 50,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Bahía las Minas on the central Caribbean coast of Panama, oiling reef flats, seagrasses, coral reefs and mangroves. In August 1986, we began a five-year study on the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) fringe and the plants and animals that live attached to submerged prop roots. This habitat forms an important part of nearshore, tropical nursery grounds. In three habitats (wave-washed open shores, channels and lagoons, and interior drainage streams), oil initially coated virtually the entire surface of submerged prop roots and sank more than 20 cm into sediments. Secondary re-oiling was heaviest in sheltered drainage streams where oil continuously leached from sediments, but also occurred on the open coast and in channels. Bivalves in channels and streams were heavily contaminated through at least May 1991. Results show this spill was a chronic source of oil contamination rather than a single point-source event. The epibiota of submerged mangrove roots had not recovered completely in any habitat after five years. Independent of this reduction, the structure of the mangrove fringe significantly changed after oiling, including decreases in the amount of shore fringed with mangroves and in the density and size of submerged prop roots. Overall, the surface area on submerged mangrove roots decreased by 33 percent on the open coast, 38 percent in channels and 74 percent in streams. The combination of chronic re-oiling, damage to epibiotic assemblages, and reductions in the biogenic substrate (submerged prop roots) has decreased the productivity of this tropical nursery area and suggests recovery will be a complex and prolonged process.

AB  - In terms of seeking the characteristics of wave propagation many engineering infrastructures can be regarded as a waveguide due to their distinguished physical properties in contrast with the natural surroundings. Coastal protection dykes can be treated as such a waveguide. Taking this as the conceptual model we try to seek the signature of the voids or defect weak spots inside the dyke or in the underlying formations on the guided elastic and electromagnetic waves. We studied the effects by first looking into numerical simulations. The numerical tool is the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We simulated both the elastic wave in two-dimensional P-Sv fashion and the electromagnetic (EM) wave in TMz mode. Simulations of the elastic wave in P-Sv fashion is for mimicking the propagation of the seismic Rayleigh wave in the waveguide; whereas simulations of the TMz mode is for mimicking the propagation of the ground penetrating radar (GPR) wave in the waveguide defined by the dyke. Given the commonly used geophysical tools for engineering non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDTE while the target defect zone size is also at meter scale with a depth of up to 10 meters. Preliminary results in numerical simulations suggest that significant feature changes can be generated by the existence of the defects. The simulation results are validated by field observations with known exist defect zone in a segment of the costal dyke.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Sedimentary organic matter (OM) analyses along a 130 km long transect of the Mkhuze River from the Lebombo Mountains to its outlet into Lake St Lucia, Africa's most extensive estuarine system, revealed the present active trapping function of a terminal freshwater wetland. Combining bulk OM analyses, such as Rock-Eval®, and source-specific biomarker analyses of plant-wax n-alkanes and their stable carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δD) isotopic composition showed that fluvial sedimentary OM originating from inland areas is mainly deposited in the floodplain and swamp area of the wetland system but not in the downstream lake area. A distinctly less degraded OM signature, i.e., a considerably lower degree of transformation of unstable components (higher I index) and lower contribution of refractory and persistent fractions (lower R index) as well as recognizably higher δD values compared to samples from upstream sub-environments, characterizes surface sediments of Lake St Lucia. The offset in δD indicates that the contributing vegetation, although similar to upstream vegetation inputs in terms of photosynthetic pathway (δ13C) and alkane distribution pattern, experienced different hydrological growth conditions. The results suggest that under current conditions hinterland sedimentary OM is deposited throughout the wetland system up to the Mkhuze Swamps, which ultimately captures the transported OM. Consequently, samples from the downstream located Lake St Lucia show locally derived signals instead of integrated signals encompassing the river catchment. This finding raises important constraints for future environmental studies as the assumption of watershed-integrated signals in sedimentary archives retrieved from downstream lakes or offshore might not hold true in certain settings. </jats:p>

AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Recent field studies at five oil spill sites where mangroves were affected provide a broad base of information on the response of mangrove communities to oiling. Three study sites in Florida (two in the Florida Keys, one in Tampa Bay) and two in eastern Puerto Rico were visted in 1978, 1979, and 1980. At each site, impacts on mangroves were assessed by the compartmental method, which uses statistical comparisons of ecological parameters between impacted and comparison stations and produces an array of biological and geomorphic data sets that allows spill sites to be compared. Despite many differences in the size of the spills and the spill sites, the responses of the oiled-mangrove communities were similar in terms of tree mortality; leaf defoliation, deformation, and stunting; seedling deformation and mortality; lenticel expansion; adventitious growth of pneumatophores; and changes in the density and distribution of plants and animals. Each spill site differed mainly in the magnitude of the stress response. Observations of the spills showed that differences in the physical environment, such as the degree of exposure to waves and currents and geomorphic features like the terrain, greatly influence the distribution and persistence of oil within different mangrove forest types. From these studies, mangrove forest types can be ranked by their predicted sensitivity to oil. This differentiation in ranking increases the value of the Environmental Sensitivity Index, especially where it is desirable to assign priorities in a campaign to protect oil-sensitive habitats from oil spills along mangrove-dominated coastlines.

AB  - A simple numerical model demonstrates that the reduction in turbulence due to stratification greatly enhances the trapping of suspended sediment that occurs at the estuarine turbidity maximum. In moderately and highly stratified estuaries the turbulent diffusivity decreases markedly between the region upstream of the salinity intrusion, where the turbulence is uninhibited by salt stratification, and the stratified regime within the salinity intrusion, where turbulence is reduced by the inhibitory influence of salt stratification. This reduction in turbulent diffusion results in a reduction in the quantity of sediment that can be carried by the flow, causing sediment to be trapped near the landward limit of the salinity intrusion. This trapping process occurs at the same location as that due to the estuarine convergence, but it appears to be many times more effective at trapping silt-size particles. A model is formulated that is similar to Festa and Hansen's (1978) model of the estuarine turbidity maximum, with the addition of a stratification-dependent eddy diffusivity. For silt-size sediment particles, the model indicates as much as a 20-fold increase in the trapping rate with inclusion of the stratification effect. It is likely that this mechanism is important in many partially mixed and highly stratified estuaries.

AB  - It could be concluded that tidal coastal zones contain high level of micro-minerals in soil and plants. Paradoxically, local goats inhabiting in this particular ecosystem are deficient in Fe, Cu and Mn. This might be an adaptive response of animals in that area. Tanins are well-known inhibitor of Fe absorption from intestine. Regular consumption of tanins and other plant alkaloids during grazing and browsing might also be responsible for low bio-availability of the minerals in the plasma. Further research is warranted to have more insight on mineral status of small ruminants in fascinating ecosystem of Sundarbans. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is here presented the results of a study of the phytosociological and plant landscape of Mount Cofano Natural Reserve (Custonaci, Trapani) together with a cartographic representation to a scale of 1:10000 (reduced to a scale of 1:20000). The studied area is localised along the western side of Sicily island and it is spread out for 537,5 ha, dominated by Mt. Cofano rocky promontory (659 mts.), regarded as one of the most interesting biotopes of the regional territory linked to its floristic, zoological and environmental features. From a geolithological point of view, the area is characterized by carbonathic substrata relative to Monte Sparacio-Monte Cofano and Monte Speziale-Monte Palatimone Units. Bioclastic calcarenites and conglomerates of arenitic type are present at the borders of the area. The most diffused pedological soil associations are lithosols (Lithic Xerorthents), rock outcrop (Rock Outcrop), "Terre rosse mediteranee" (Lithic Rhodoxeralfs) and "Suoli bruni" (Typic Xerochrepts). From a bioclimatic point of view, the whole territory is included in the (lower) thermomediterranean upper dry belt, but the northern part of Mt. Cofano, above 450 mts. altitude, is to be referred to the (lower) mesomediterranean upper suhumid belt. In order to give a good interpretation of sigmeta and microgeosigmeta of the natural landscape, the syndinamic relationships between several series of vegetation are discussed as well as the ecological, floristic and structural-physiognomic characters of the plant communities. The climatophilous series are the following: - coastal. Sicilian, basophilous, of calcarenites, thermomediterranean dry series of kermes oak (Chamaeropo humilis-Querco calliprini sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous and umbrophilous, of detrital slopes, thermomediterranean dry series of holm oak and termophilous deciduous species (Rhamno alaterni-Querco ilicis pistacietoso terebinthi sigmetosum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous and heliophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry-subhumid series of holm oak and Pistacia lentiscus (Pistado lentisci-Querco ilicis sigmetum); - hilly Sicilian, neutroacidophilous, of leached calcareous soils, mesomediterranean subhumid series of holm oak and strawberry tree (Pistacio lentisci-Querco ilicis arbutetoso unedonis sigmetosum). The edaphophilous series are the following: - coastal Tyrrhenian, basophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of dwarf palm (Pistacio-Chamaeropo humilis sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of wild olive (Rhamno-Euphorbio dendroidis euphorbietoso bivonae sigmetosum). The microgeosigmeta of maritime cliffs, rocky slopes, detrital slopes and temporary ponds are also presented. Some new syntaxa referred to Crithmo-Limonietea (Limonietum bocconei subass. limonietosum bocconei and subass. helichrysetosum cophanensis), Crataego-Prunetea (Clematido cirrhosae-Rubetum ulmifolii subass. calystegietosum sylvaticae and subass. rhoetosum coriariae), Cisto-Micromerietea (Brachypodio ramosi-Cistetum cretici), Scrophulario-Helichrysetea italici (Sedo sediformis-Centranthetum rubri) and Quercetea ilicis (Pyro amygdaliformis- Calicotometum infestae, Pistacio lentisci-Quercetum ilicis subass. arbutetosum unedonis) classes are described. © Società Italiana di Scienza della Vegetazione.

AB  - We present data on the colonization of Middleton Island, Alaska, by Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) following the creation of an extensive rocky intertidal zone after the Alaskan earthquake of 1964. The first pair of oystercatchers was detected in 1976, and it was another 5 years before the population increased to three pairs. Oystercatcher numbers increased steadily thereafter, with a population explosion occurring in the 1990s. By 2002, there were 171 territorial pairs on the island. The total number of birds increased from two in 1976 to 718 in 2002. Breeding-pair densities on Middleton Island are the highest recorded for any portion of Alaska, averaging more than 5 pairs per km of shoreline in 2002. Nesting success in 2001 and 2002 was greater (83 or more of the eggs laid hatched) than that reported for any other population of oystercatchers in Alaska or along the Pacific Coast. We attribute this exponential growth rate and exceptionally high reproductive success to the large area of available and suitable habitat, the low number of avian predators and the complete lack of mammalian predators, low rate of nest loss to high tides and storm surges, and a low level of human disturbance. We propose nominating Middleton Island as a regional Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site because a high percentage of the world's and region's population of Black Oystercatchers resides there during the breeding season. Further, since Middleton Island may be the single most important site in Alaska for Black Oystercatchers, we suggest it be protected from future development. Colonizacin, Crecimiento Poblacional y xito de Nidada de Ostreros Negros Luego de un Movimiento Ssmico Resumen.Presentamos datos sobre la colonizacin de la Isla Middleton, Alaska, por el Haematopus bachmani, luego de la creacin de una extensa zona intermareal rocosa como resultado del terremoto ocurrido en 1964. La primera pareja de ostreros fue detectada en 1976, y pasaron otros 5 años antes de que la poblacin aumente a tres parejas. Desde entonces los nmeros de ostreros crecieron constantemente con una explosin de la poblacin ocurrida en los 1990s. En 2002 haba 171 parejas territoriales en la isla. El nmero total de individuos aument de dos en 1976 a 718 en 2002. Las densidades de parejas reproductivas en la Isla Middleton son las ms altas registradas en cualquier lugar de Alaska, promediando ms de 5 parejas por km de costa en 2002. El xito de nidada en 2001 y 2002 fue mayor (83 o ms de los huevos depositados eclosionaron) que el informado para cualquier otra poblacin de ostreros de Alaska o de la costa Pacfica. Atribuimos esta tasa de crecimiento exponencial y el excepcional y alto xito reproductivo, a la gran superficie con hbitat adecuado disponible, al bajo nmero de aves predadoras y a la completa ausencia de mamferos predadores, a la baja tasa de perdida de nidos por mareas altas u oleaje por tormentas, y al bajo grado de disturbio humano. Proponemos la nominacin de la Isla de Middleton como Sitio Regional de la Red Hemisfrica de Reservas para Aves Playeras, dado el elevado porcentaje de la poblacin mundial y regional de ostreros negros que all residen durante la temporada reproductiva. Adems, dado que la Isla Middleton podra ser el sitio ms importante de Alaska para Haematopus bachmani, sugerimos que debera ser protegida del desarrollo en el futuro.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide numerous services, such as nutrient cycling, climate change amelioration, and habitat provision for commercially valuable organisms. Ecosystem functions and processes are modified by human activities locally and globally, with degradation of coastal ecosystems by development and climate change occurring at unprecedented rates. The demand for coastal defense strategies against storms and sea-level rise has increased with human population growth and development along coastlines world-wide, even while that population growth has reduced natural buffering of shorelines. Shoreline hardening, a common coastal defense strategy that includes the use of seawalls and bulkheads (vertical walls constructed of concrete, wood, vinyl, or steel), is resulting in a "coastal squeeze" on estuarine habitats. In contrast to hardening, living shorelines, which range from vegetation plantings to a combination of hard structures and plantings, can be deployed to restore or enhance multiple ecosystem services normally delivered by naturally vegetated shores. Although hundreds of living shoreline projects have been implemented in the United States alone, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness in sustaining or enhancing ecosystem services relative to naturally vegetated shorelines and hardened shorelines. We quantified the effectiveness of (1) sills with landward marsh (a type of living shoreline that combines marsh plantings with an offshore low-profile breakwater), (2) natural salt marsh shorelines (control marshes), and (3) unvegetated bulkheaded shores in providing habitat for fish and crustaceans (nekton). Sills supported higher abundances and species diversity of fishes than unvegetated habitat adjacent to bulkheads, and even control marshes. Sills also supported higher cover of filter-feeding bivalves (a food resource and refuge habitat for nekton) than bulkheads or control marshes. These ecosystem-service enhancements were detected on shores with sills three or more years after construction, but not before. Sills provide added structure and may provide better refuges from predation and greater opportunity to use available food resources for nekton than unvegetated bulkheaded shores or control marshes. Our study shows that unlike shoreline hardening, living shorelines can enhance some ecosystem services provided by marshes, such as provision of nursery habitat.

AB  - Goble, B.J. and Mackay, C.F. 2013. Developing risk set-back lines for coastal protection using shoreline change and climate variability factors. Proceedings 12th International Coastal Symposium (Plymouth, England), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 65, pp. 21252130, ISSN 0749-0208.--> In a changing climate, coastal zones are increasingly susceptible to coastal hazards. In South Africa this is exacerbated by growing pressure for coastal frontage development. Hence the recognised, urgent need to better control and manage development in the coastal zone. A formal guideline in this regard, is the development of coastal set-back lines to ensure new development is protected from coastal events and slower, climate driven changes. Authorities concerned over potential hazards in the coastal zone are now thinking of how to determine and implement risk set-back lines. This paper presents the stepwise process arrived at, to determine such a risk set-back line for KwaZulu-Natal. The process is simple, cost-effective and considers three key factors; historical shoreline change, sea-level rise and coastal vulnerability. For this study, three set-back line lifespans where considered; 25, 50 and 100 years. This time range allows for both long-term management and short-term understanding of coastal risks and vulnerability. Set-back lines for the three time scenarios range from 0 to 99m, 198m and 394m respectively. The methodology is robust and easily repeatable, and has been designed in such a manner that alternative or additional data can be easily included and the methodology can be refined over time. The delineation and enforcement of risk set-back lines is a quick solution to address the pressing problems of coastal KZN, and should also ensure effective short- to medium-term management of the coast.

AB  - The Lerma marshes maintain a high diversity impacted and damaged by industrial and urban development of the Valley of Toluca. The changes, exchanges and the systematic transitions of land use occurred in the marshes between 1973 and 2008 were evaluated and related to the current diversity of aquatic vegetation. We use correspondence analysis to visualize the distribution of the dominant flora and the type of plants prevalent in each wetland. Transformation processes vary spatially and temporally in each marsh, but the general trend is the loss of open water areas and cattail marshes, which tend to transform into lands of low flood with hydrophytes of smaller size and adapted to disturbance, later these fields are replaced by farmland and urban spaces. The rate of destruction of wetlands was most intense from 1973 to 1989, but remained in 2008. The expansion of agricultural and urban areas has displaced flood areas, causing negative effects on diversity and structure of aquatic vegetation in the marshes.

AB  - Two local threatened endemics from Valencian salt marshes were analysed from a multidisciplinary perspective combining field studies with experiments performed under greenhouse-controlled conditions. The work aimed to investigate the habitat of the two species but also to explore their limits of tolerance to severe drought and salinity and the mechanisms behind their stress responses. The number of individuals in several populations, climatic conditions, soil characteristics and accompanying vegetation in the natural habitats were analysed in the field study. Plants obtained by seed germination were grown in the greenhouse and subjected to one month of water and salt stress treatments. Growth and biochemical parameters were analysed after the treatments were finalised. No correlation between climatic parameters and the number of individuals censed of the two Limonium species could be established. Although L. dufourii was found in more saline soils in the natural habitats, under controlled greenhouse conditions, this species was more severely affected by salt treatment than L. albuferae, which is more susceptible to water stress. A common biochemical response was the increase of proline under all stress treatments, but mostly in water-stressed plants. Oxidative stress markers, MDA and H2O2, did not indicate significant differences between the treatments. The differences in the two species' responses to the two kinds of stress were correlated with the activation of the antioxidant enzymes, more pronounced in conditions of salt stress in L. albuferae and of water stress in L. dufourii. Although L. albuferae is found in sites with lower salinity in the natural habitats, the greenhouse experiment indicated that it tolerates higher concentrations of salt than L. dufouri, which is more resistant to drought. The two species efficiently mitigate oxidative stress by activation of antioxidant enzymes. The results obtained may be helpful for the conservation management of the two species: whereas salinity is not problematic, as the two species tolerated under controlled conditions salinities far beyond those in their natural environments, water scarcity may be a problem for L. albuferae, which proved to be more susceptible to water deficit.

AB  - Wetlands are being considered increasingly important for wastewater treatment because of the ability of many wetland plants to absorb large amounts of nutrient and a variety of toxic substances. The paper highlights the physical, chemical and biological processes which contribute to the improvement of water quality, and the distinction between natural and constructed wetlands. The impacts of long-term wastewater disposal on the biotic changes, reduction in treatment efficiency, and wetland processes such as production of trace gases, are pointed out. Constraints in using wetlands, for wastewater treatment, such as poor understanding of the natural wetland functions and responses of native plants and animals to wastewater, particularly in developing countries, are briefly discussed. It is suggested that while the possibilities for using constructed wetlands based on native species for small communities are explored, greater emphasis should be laid on the restoration of lost and degraded wetlands, especially the river floodplains, lake littorals and coastal wetlands, which can help check pollution fi-om non-point sources.

AB  - Increasing stress from global warming, sea level rise, acidification, sedimentation, pollution, and unsustainable practices have degraded the most critical coastal ecosystems including coral reefs, oyster reefs, and salt marshes. Conventional restoration methods work only under perfect conditions, but fail nearly completely when the water becomes too hot or water quality deteriorates. New methods are needed to greatly increase settlement, growth, survival, and resistance to environmental stress of keystone marine organisms in order to maintain critical coastal ecosystem functions including shore protection, fisheries, and biodiversity. Electrolysis methods have been applied to marine ecosystem restoration since 1976, with spectacular results (Figures 1(a)-(c)). This paper provides the first overall review of the data. Low-voltage direct current trickle charges are found to increase the settlement of corals 25.86 times higher than uncharged control sites, to increase the mean growth rates of reef-building corals, soft corals, oysters, and salt marsh grass— an average of 3.17 times faster than controls (ranging from 2 to 10 times depending on species and conditions), and to increase the survival of electrically charged marine organisms—an average of 3.47 times greater than controls, with the biggest increases under the most severe environmental stresses. These results are caused by the fundamental biophysical stimulation of natural biochemical energy production pathways, used by all organisms, provided by electrical stimulation under the right conditions. This paper reviews for the first time all published results from properly designed, installed, and maintained projects, and contrasts them with those that do not meet these criteria.

AB  - Out of many experimental applications of the 'Coastal Protection and Nourishment System' (CPNS), a soft shore protection arrangement, the one installed in June 1998 at the beach of Kato Loutro, Prefecture of Corinthia, will be evaluated in respect to the system stability, integrity, general environmental impacts, beach protection effectiveness, and longevity, on the basis of recent field survey results after 13 years (June 1998 to April 2011) of operation. Previous evaluations of other CPNS experiments published in 1998, 2000, and 2003 are found to be comparable to the ones exposed here. The present evaluation is based on direct site measurements made recently after the above time-period, during which no maintenance was made and provides conclusive evidence that the beach treated, is protected against many undesired impacts, i.e., erosion, coastline recession and seabed changes that may render unfriendly the use of the beach. The types of eroding beaches that can be treated and protected by installing this arrangement are discussed, together with comparative comments with other soft shore protection methods.

AB  - Alnus maritima (seaside alder) occurs in wet or flooded soils on the Delmarva Peninsula (southern Delaware and adjacent counties of eastern Maryland, USA) and in small niches in Georgia and Oklahoma. Although some A. maritima exist in coastal estuaries, responses of the species to salt, and whether salt resistance depends on provenance of plant origin, are not known. We first compared salt injury among A. maritima from all provenances irrigated with dilutions of ocean water. Seedlings from the three provenances responded similarly. Salinity up to 3.1 g/kg did not alter stem elongation but did cause increases in the ratio of dry to fresh weight of basipetal leaves, which reflected their necrosis. Photosynthesis and growth after treatment with salt then were compared among A. maritima and four other woody species: Baccharis halimifolia, Ceanothus americanus, Myrica cerifera, and Cornus amomum. Irrigation solutions with up to 12 g/kg salinity had no effect on B. halimifolia and caused no visible damage to M. Cerifera. Ceanothus americanus showed foliar necrosis and decreases in photosynthesis at 3, 6, and 12 g/kg. Photosynthesis of A. maritima and C. amomum was sustained after irrigating with solutions at 3 g/kg but was reduced by 6 and 12 g/kg salinity. Our third experiment showed a more pronounced decrease in photosynthesis as salinity increased for A. maritima with roots partially or totally inundated in solutions with salt compared to plants irrigated but not inundated with these solutions. Lastly, symptoms of salt injury among A. maritima planted at locations that differed in salinity along the Broadkill River, an estuary in Delaware, were found to be similar to those we documented among plants treated in a greenhouse. We conclude that necrosis of basipetal leaves is the most apparent symptom of injury caused by salt in the root zones of A. maritima, that low concentrations of salt can lead to damage, and that the rate at which symptoms develop in this riparian species varies with the extent of root-zone inundation with salt water. Alnus maritima was less sensitive than C. americanus to salt but was considerably more sensitive than B. halimifolia and M. cerifera.

AB  - Green, A.; Cooper, J.A.G., and LeVieux, A., 2013. Unusual barrier/inlet behaviour associated with active coastal progradation and river-dominated estuaries. The mesoscale behaviour of unusual barrier inlets on the east coast of South Africa is described. The inlets are associated with river-dominated estuaries and are consequently subject to periodic closure during low river flow. They are also located on a prograding barrier coast. Deflection of the estuary channel of a small river in the direction of longshore transport by 1230 m resulted in its capture by the estuarine channel of a larger river. The larger catchment river was not deflected by coastal progradation but maintained its position by periodic breaching of a channel through the barrier during floods. Flood breaches reseal by landward reworking of ephemeral deltas and may undergo limited migration. A tidal inlet at the northern end of the barrier is maintained by a small tidal prism and has a flood-tidal delta. It exhibits limited lateral migration and closes occasionally when wave-generated sediment transport filling the channel overcomes the flushing ability produced by tidal currents and freshwater discharge by the river. Large swell waves and the development of a washover channel cause the occasional breaching of the barrier, creating an ephemeral inlet midway along the barrier. The position of this breach is likely controlled by wave refraction patterns.

AB  - The population density and activity of a microbial community associated with the sediment and rhizosphere of an intertidal freshwater wetland dominated by Scirpus pungens was monitored before and following the application of weathered Mesa light crude oil and fertilizers. The influence of nutrient enrichment (fertilizers) and plant growth on oil degradation rates was determined from the resulting data. The study plots (four blocks of replicates) were subjected to five treatments: oil only (natural attenuation); oil plus ammonium nitrate and phosphate, with regular cropping of the plants; oil plus ammonium nitrate and phosphate; oil plus sodium nitrate and phosphate; no oil, ammonium nitrate and phosphate. The plots were regularly monitored in the field for gas production (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide), and samples were collected for laboratory analysis of denitrification activity, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation activity, and total heteroptrophic bacteria. The viable bacterial population density increased during the first 4 weeks in oiled and unoiled experimental plots that were fertilized. In contrast, population densities in untreated areas remained relatively unchanged throughout the monitoring period. The microbial population demonstrated a rapid and sustained increase in naphthalene mineralization activity in plots that were both fertilized and oiled. Hexadecane mineralization activity increased in response to fertilizer application, with ammonium nitrate causing a larger increase than sodium nitrate. A very significant difference observed in the mineralization of hexadecane was that the surface sediments were much more active than the subsurface sediments. This difference became even more pronounced in the second year of monitoring, even though the treatment regime had been discontinued. This compartmentalization of mineral- ization activity was not observed for naphthalene. Following fertilizer application, field and laboratory evaluation of nitrogen metabolism in the sediments indicated significant denitrification activity that was not adversely affected by oiling. The results demonstrated that the application of fertilizers stimulated the activities of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading and denitrifying bacteria, and the presence of oil either enhanced or had no detrimental effect on these activities. As a remediation strategy, the application of fertilizers to a wetland shoreline following an oil spill would promote the growth of indigenous plants and their associated microbial flora, resulting in increased metabolic activity and the potential for increased oil degradation activity.

AB  - Presently a storm-surge barrier is under construction in the mouth of the Oosterschelde. After its completion tidal conditions in the estuary can be controlled. In order to indicate the limiting conditions for conceivable uses of the storm-surge barrier a number of the most prominent salt-marsh species were tested in their various life stages against immersion times of 2, 4 and 8 days. Most of the species were able to withstand an extended immersion fairly well, although some of them showed reduced growth during-and after immersion. No evident relation was found between the position of the species on the salt-marsh ecotone and their inundation tolerance. Only one taxon from the upper marsh, Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis, showed a total die-back after an 8 day summer inundation. Most of the species involved showed a decreasing immersion tolerance with increasing water temperatures. Limonium vulgare and Juncus gerardii, however, exhibited a significant growth increase after extended immersion, even at a temperature of the inundation water of 36°C. In contrast herewith flowers and flower buds started to decay after as little as a 2 day immersion. For Aster tripolium prolonged immersion reduced seed weight and germination capacity of the seeds. Germination and seed weight of Salicornia dolichostachya were not affected by prolonged immersion. It is concluded that prolonged summer inundations will cause an overall negative effect on the salt-marsh vegetation. © 1985 Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Presently a storm-surge barrier is under construction in the mouth of the Oosterschelde. After its completion tidal conditions in the estuary can be controlled. In order to indicate the limiting conditions for conceivable uses of the storm-surge barrier a number of the most prominent salt-marsh species were tested in their various life stages against immersion times of 2, 4 and 8 days.

AB  - Banksia littoralis (Proteaceae) inhabits winter-wet locations and wetland fringes that are prone to seasonal flooding events on the Swan Coastal Plain. To survive in these locations, B. littoralis seedlings must be able to tolerate periods of flooding or complete submergence if establishment is to be successful. Flood tolerance was assessed in seedlings of B. littoralis subjected to 104 days of continual soil waterlogging by comparing changes in seedling growth and leaf ecophysiology with those of well-watered plants. Flood tolerance was also assessed in seedlings of Banksia prionotes, a species that grows in drier locations on the Swan Coastal Plain. As expected, B. prionotes was unable to survive long periods of soil waterlogging or submergence (97% mortality after 72 days of flooding). Both species responded to flooding by closing their stomates and reducing photosynthetic capacity, although B. littoralis was able to recover lost photosynthetic potential when flooded conditions subsided. After 72 days of flooding, there was a substantial decrease in relative growth rate in flooded B. prionotes seedlings, compared to that of well-watered plants, although this was not associated with significant differences in biomass allocation. Flood-affected B. littoralis seedlings were significantly smaller than well-watered seedlings after 72 days of flooding, but were the same size after 104 days. Flood tolerance enables B. littoralis seedlings to survive exceptionally wet winter-spring months when flooding events are more likely to occur, although surviving the annual summer drought may be more important to sustain seedling establishment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Groves, D.G. and Sharon, C., 2013. Planning tool to support planning the future of coastal Louisiana. Coastal Louisiana's built and natural environment faces risks from catastrophic tropical storms. Concurrently, the region is experiencing a dramatic conversion of coastal land and associated habitats to open water and a loss of important services provided by such ecosystems. Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) engaged in a detailed modeling, simulation, and analysis exercise, the results of which informed Louisiana's 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. The Master Plan defines a set of coastal risk-reduction and restoration projects to be implemented in the coming decades to reduce hurricane flood risk to coastal communities and restore the Louisiana coast. Risk-reduction and restoration projects were selected to provide the greatest level of risk-reduction and land-building benefits under a given budget constraint while being consistent with other o...

AB  - A report by the British Department of the Environment calls for research into the effect of a rise in world temperatures on sea levels. Model studies should investigate changes in the pattern of coastal erosion and deposition, as well as the effect of new coastal defences, and the potential incursion of salt water into freshwater resources should also be evaluated. This paper addresses the later problem as it pertains to increased saltwater intrusion into rivers due to higher sea levels and lower upland discharges, caused by the greenhouse effect.

AB  - In the past decades, the crest height of the seawall was determined by the allowable average wave overtopping rate q. Franco (1994) concluded that individual wave overtopping,particularly the maximum individual volume, provided a better design method than q, considering the stability of the seawall and the safety of vehicles and people along the coastal area protected by the coastal defense structures. Shanghai, located on the west bank of the Pacific Ocean, is quite sensitive to the risk of storm surges and violent wave overtopping. The crown-wall serves as an engineering measure to reduce the wave overtopping effectively.

AB  - The Tyrrehnian coast of Calabria (Italy) has been affected by erosion in the last thirty years. Between the resorts of Belvedere and Amantea, for more than 80 Kin, one of the principal Italian railways line, the national 'road n degrees 118 and many built up area that behind the beach alternate, suffered many damages during the years. From 1980, many protection works were realised to maintain the emerged beaches and to protect the structures and the infrastructures that lay behind. Some of the interventions went successfully, some were ineffective, some even increased the down-drift phenomena, some are still waiting to reach a final satisfactory configuration. Four interventions at Paola - San Lucido, Amantea, Belvedere - Bonifati and Cetraro were realised or are under construction. They are described and analysed to outline the learning from the activity carried out over twenty years of coastal designs and realisations.

AB  - The city of Braganca, which has more than 45,000 inhabitants living on an area of approximately 16km(2), is one of the oldest colonial settlements of the Amazon region. Over the past few years, several serious sanitation problems have become apparent. This study describes the effects of wastewater discharge originating from the city on the water quality of the nearby Caete Estuary and its tributary the Cereja River, which passes directly through the city centre. Both rivers receive large amounts of wastewater disposed by private households, hospitals, workshops and fish processing companies. Surface samples of river water from the Cereja (station 1) and the Caete (station 2) were collected bi-monthly in Niskin bottles between April 2006 and February 2007. Water samples contained high concentrations of nitrites, nitrates and phosphates, as well as high concentrations of chlorophyll a. Elevated counts of fecal coliforms (>1100 MPN/100mL) indicated microbial contamination. In the Caete Estuary, dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll a concentrations, and bacterial counts declined during the months of highest rainfall, probably due to dilution effects. In the Cereja, by contrast, the highest concentrations of nutrients were recorded during the rainy season, when the river flooded and began to receive sewage directly from clandestine outfalls and other material from the lixiviation of surrounding areas. Clearly, the Cereja River is a source of contamination for the Caete Estuary, in particular during the rainiest months of the year. Installation of basic sanitary facilities by local governmental authorities could mitigate the contamination of river water in Braganca.

AB  - ABSTRACT The facilities of the PTP (PetroTerminal de Panama) consist of an 80 mile long, 36 inch pipeline and two marine terminals. The Pacific facility consists of three shore-based terminals to handle tankers from Valdez, Alaska. The Atlantic terminal contains two single-point moorings to load tankers destined for U.S. ports along the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to the opening of the pipeline, the government of Panama contracted for a series of studies designed to better understand the shoreline sensitivity, marine resources, archaeology, and limnology along the pipeline route and adjacent to each terminal. Results of the shoreline sensitivity analysis indicate that, by far, the Atlantic terminal in the Laguna de Chiriqui is the most sensitive and likely to be damaged during a spill. The laguna has almost no tides, is relatively stagnant, and is dominated by mangroves (51 percent of the total shoreline). In contrast, the Pacific terminal contains much higher tides and currents and fewer mangroves [44 percent of the total shoreline, but less than 5 percent within 30 miles of the terminal]. In response to environmental concerns and greatly supported and advised by the pipeline user companies, PTP completed a workable spill-response plan, developed along three fronts: the active and continuing purchase of spill-response equipment for use at the marine facilities as well as in fast-moving streams; the creation of specially trained spill-response teams; and the delegation of clear lines of authority for both land and marine spills. The interrelated roles played by Panamanians, the people of PTP, and the pipeline user companies provide an example of how different groups can cooperatively work together to protect the environment and still maintain financially advantageous, oil-related projects in a lesser-developed country.

AB  - Land reclamation is a complex marine environmental engineering and has a huge impact on social, economic, and physical environment. Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REM to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of RELA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000. Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20% similar to 30% along the western coast in the Lngdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally., More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.

AB  - Governmental programmes and international agreements to counteract eutrophication have largely not attained agreed goals (e. g. reduction by half of the anthropogenic nitrogen load on Swedish coastal waters and to the Baltic Sea). One explanation to the fact that the goals are not achieved yet might be that the most effective building blocks to counteract diffuse pollution are far from being fully implemented. It is therefore important to stress the potential in some very effective measures and find ways to fully implement them in a strategic way at the watershed level. To avoid overdoses of fertilizers in crop production is very important since overdoses lead to an exponential growth in the leaching magnitude. Field experiments indicate that the use of winter crops or an undersown catch crop outside the main cropping season has cut back the nitrate losses with up to 75% in a single year and close to 50% during a longer period of successive years. In southern Sweden, the area of wetlands has been decreased considerably (more than 90%) by melioration activities. In a recent project, mass balances in full scale restored ponds, verified the importance of ponds and wetlands in nitrogen retention. Per unit area, increased nitrogen loading implied increased nitrogen retention, but often a decreased retention percentage. Sedimentation of organic material must be favoured in order to obtain adequate conditions for denitrification. To achieve the governmental goal in nitrogen load reduction, proper agricultural practices must be combined with restoration of ponds/wetlands.

AB  - While crabs occur in perhaps most salt-marshes and mangroves worldwide, they are rarely considered in studies dealing with tidal fluxes of plant detritus from these coastal wetlands to adjacent waters. However, crabs can affect the production, availability and tidal transport of plant detritus in a variety of ways. This includes controls via both assimilatorydissimilatory mechanisms (e.g., herbivory, detritivory, seed and propagule consumption) and non assimilatory, non dissimilatory environmental modification (i.e., physical ecosystem engineering; e.g., sediment oxygenation via burrows, detritus excavation and burial, detritus trapping into burrows). Given the high densities and activity rates shown by many crab species, their effects on the export of plant detritus are expected to be important relative to overall marsh production. Therefore, the predictive capacity of models dealing with detritus export by salt marshes and mangroves is likely to be enhanced by considering crab influences. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Geoscientific and geoarchaeological studies carried out at the ancient harbour site of Kyllini (western Peloponnese, Greece) revealed distinct evidence of repeated tsunami landfall. Located in the westernmost part of the Peloponnese, the Kyllini harbour site is situated at a narrow stretch of coastal lowland along the northeastern edge of Cape Kyllini. Directly exposed to the Ionian Sea and the Hellenic Trench, the harbour holds a considerably high risk for tsunami events and thus represents a valuable geoarchive for palaeotsunami research. While the inner harbour basin is merely preserved as a near-coast swamp, partially submerged installations like moles, quays, breakwaters and towers clearly define the outer harbour basin. Geoscientific studies carried out at the Kyllini harbour site comprised on-shore and coastal vibracoring, sedimentological, geochemical and microfossil analyses of the recovered sediments as well as electrical resistivity measurements. The overall geochronological framework is based on radiocarbon dating of biogenic material and age determination of diagnostic ceramic fragments. The stratigraphical record of the harbour site reveals an autochthonous pre-harbour marine embayment on top of Pliocene bedrock. Following a first high-energy impact, a coastal lake was established that was subsequently used as harbour basin and fortified by man. Following a period of siltation, the harbour sequence is abruptly overlain by a massive layer of coarse grained marine sand, indicating a sudden high-energy impact to the harbour site. Partly preserved as geoarchaeological destruction layer and post-depositionally cemented, the layer forms beachrock-type calcarenitic tsunamites. Our results suggest that the harbour site of Kyllini was affected by two tsunami events. A first event occurred between the late 7th and early 4th cent. BC prior to the harbour foundation while it seems as if at least parts of the harbour basin were later destroyed by a second tsunami event between the 4th and 6th cent.

AB  - Rising seas increase the exposure, vulnerability, and thus the risk associated with storm surge flowing across the coastal floodplain (Passeri et al. 2015). This is especially true across low-gradient coastal landscapes such as Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. The extent and depth of flooding will be exasperated over the long term by morphologic changes to the shoreline, dunes and barrier islands (Plant et al. 2016, Passeri et al. 2016), marsh evolution (Alizad et al. 2016, Kidwell et al. 2017, Morris et al. 2016), and land use and land cover changes (Bilskie et al. 2014 & 2016). This presentation will describe how to incorporate biogeophysical impacts of climate change into future tide and surge models. A methodology will be presented (Bilskie et al. 2018) to down select a suite of synthetic storms from recent flood insurance studies to force hurricane storm surge models that represent present day and future changes to the coastal landscape under four sea level rise (SLR) scenarios of low (0.2 m), intermediate-low (0.5 m), intermediate-high (1.2 m), and high (2.0 m). Results of peak storm surge are used to compute the 100-year and 500-year return period floodplain and stillwater surge heights for each SLR scenario.

AB  - <jats:p><p><b>The ecological resilience of the intertidal margins of many cities is increasingly under pressure due to climatic shifts and urbanisation.

AB  - Coastal areas in Louisiana and around the globe have been impacted by coastal sediment subsidence and sea level rise. Powerful storms have added to coastal erosion. Louisiana, with 40% of the nation's coastal wetlands, is suffering 90% of the nation's coastal wetland loss. Coastal bioengineering, using living organisms such as the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, to help grow coastal protection, can be cost effective and can protect or even grow coastal land. Two oyster reefs were placed in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana in 2012. Each reef consists of approximately 560 rings; 40 rings across, 7 rows, and 2 layers. The rings are 5 feet in diameter and have a 9 inch wall thickness. Over time, oysters have grown on the rings, increasing the strength and size of the barrier. This phenomenon can help influence future structures to be more sustainable over a longer period of time and increase coastal structures' lifespan. Counts of oysters (size and density) have been made over the last three years, and estimates of land growth have been made over that same period. While the process is dynamic, involving growth, predation, death, and is influenced by tidal and wave events, the overall trend is toward consistent growth of the oysters and growth of land in the lee of the reefs. This paper provides some details of this study and suggests possible ways that this type of coastal bioengineering can aid in enhancing sustainable coastal protection in Louisiana and other areas.

AB  - The coastal wetland, a key transitional zone between land and ocean, is a complex and sensitive ecosystem with special environmental processes and functional values. Sediment and sea water samples were taken from Chongming east intertidal flat, a typical coastal wetland in China. Sediment cores were incubated under simulated spring tides (approximately twice a month) and semi-diurnal tides (two almost equal high tides and two low tides in a lunar day), to define the responses of nitrogen to periodic alternation of drying and re-flooding. The contents of NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N, dissolved organic N (DON), and the activities of nitrate reductase (Nar), nitrite reductase (Nir), and hydroxylamine reductase (Hyr) in sediments were determined during the incubation. Nitrification stood in a dominant position during the drying period with sediment moisture decreasing from 35% to 5% -7% in simulated spring tides. The NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N were found to be substantially converted into DON following a further exsiccation (the sediment moisture decreased from 5%-7% to 0%-3%). However, the conversion rates decreased with the increase of drying and rewetting cycles. Following the rewetting of dried sediments (from 0% -3% to 37% -45%), the contents of NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N and DON increased to 1 to 3 times that of the dry sediments. Nar and Nir activities in sediments rapidly increased after the rewetting, indicating that the reduction of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N were substantially enhanced. Significant positive correlations were found between Nar and Nir activities, and Hyr activities and NH4(+) -N contents during the simulated spring tides. Moreover, the decreases of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N contents were observed to be significantly correlated to the increases of NH4(+) -N contents. Combined with the fact that the sediment had a high organic carbon content but a very low NO3(-) -N content, it can be concluded that the reduction of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N following the rewetting was dominated by nitrate ammonification. In contrast, NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N and DON contents in sediments were relatively stable during semi-diurnal tides, which were (3.0 +/- 0.3), (1.2 +/- 0.1), (133.3 +/- 4.3) and (41.1 +/- 10.6) mg x kg(-1), respectively. This indicated that semi-diurnal tides slightly affected the variations of nitrogen contents in the wetlands.

AB  - In this study, we estimated hazardous area vulnerable to storm surge and also investigated the areal increases under sea level rise condition. For quantitative assessment together with geospatial analysis with GIS we used precise one-meter-gridded airborne LiDAR-based topographical models, the relative vertical accuracies of which fall within ca. 30 cm excluding outliers. According to the inundation prediction the storm surge hazardous area is predicted to range approximately from 6 to 20 km(2) depending on the storm power. The result shows also that in the higher sea level condition in 2100 the areal extent could be increased by up to 68 %. Being noteworthy the areal increase was greater in the small-scale storms than in the large. The elevation models and cross-sectional profiles of the barrier islands protecting the Nakdong estuary were acquired for further assessment and discussion on their roles of natural underwater dykes. As larger inundation potential could be transferred into greater socioeconomic damages, the authors expect that precise quantitative estimation of vulnerability could be used for efficient and rational information for long-term coastal management planning.

AB  - As reported in several studies, even though properly designed, it is possible that groin systems not only cause down-drift beaches to erode, but also contribute to the generation of rip currents. These rip currents run along the updrift side of the structure, moving sediment offshore where it may be, at least in part, lost from the system. It is well known that the directionality of the incident waves is a central factor for the shoreline response to groins. Until now, however, this directionality has been characterized only by the ratio of net transport rate Q(n) to gross transport rate Q(g). In this study it is concluded that the phase lag between the forcing and the morphodynamic response is another key factor responsible for these offshore losses. Based upon this, a relaxation time for open-coast systems and a non-dimensional morphodynamic response factor for groin compartments are introduced as new design parameters for groin systems. These parameters provide an indication about the time it takes for the morphodynamic system to adjust to a change in the hydrodynamic forcing conditions.

AB  - The use of offshore breakwaters for shoreline erosion control and/or recreational beach fill retention is ever increasing in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay. Breakwaters and breakwater systems can be designed utilizing an analysis of the shore morphology and geomorphic evolution of a particular estuarine shore reach. This will reflect the long term wave climate acting on that reach and in particular the net direction of wave approach. The net direction of wave approach is used to establish the dimensions of the two breakwater systems discussed in this paper. These dimensions include breakwater length, gap, and distance offshore. The addition of select beach fill is usually required to provide enhanced recreation and shoreline protection benefits.

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s the biology and geology of the Grand Recif of Tulear, (now Toliara) in southwestern Madagascar, was thoroughly studied and reported. Toliara is the largest city in the south of the country, and the Grand Recif offshore provides both artisanal fisheries and coastal protection to the growing regional capital. Substantial research on the comparatively pristine reef was described in a volume of Atoll Research Bulletin in 1978. Since then, published scientific study of this reef has been largely lacking. The present study compares the condition of the Grand Recif of circa 40 years ago, with that seen in a brief resurvey undertaken in 2008, on transects corresponding to some of those documented previously. The trend has been of severe degradation; hard coral cover on the fore-reef slopes has declined substantially, and there has been a near total loss of the "architectural species" in particular. Coral has been replaced to great extent by fleshy algae. Observations also indicate severe decline on the broad reef flat, back reef and lagoon areas. Perhaps most seriously for the local fisheries and human communities, is that the fore reef is almost depleted in reef fish today. Comparisons are made of coral cover, coral morphological types and fish trophic structure with other reefs in southern Madagascar, which are not located near large human populations. Although a rise in mean sea surface temperature has occurred throughout the region of approximately 1C over this 40 year period, which is probably a contributing cause of decline throughout, the Grand Recif is in much worse condition than most of the more remote reefs with which it is compared. It is suggested that the main reasons for the substantial decline in the Grand Recif over the past 40 years lies in the fact that the region's population has grown substantially, there is a complete lack of any resources management, heavy overfishing, and no pollution control, resulting in massively increased discharges of sewage, sediments and other pollutants. Reef condition today is unrecognisable from that described in the 1970s. Unless far-reaching and effective management interventions are adopted to safeguard the Grand Recif the remaining ecosystem services upon which Toliara and its population depend will soon all but disappear.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are estuarine basins where freshwater inflows are trapped behind coastal dune systems, sand spits, or barrier islands which impede exchange with the ocean. They are most frequent in regions where freshwater inflows to the coast are small or seasonal, so that exchange with the ocean may not occur for months or years at a time. Many occupy shallow drowned valleys formed when the sea level was lower during the last ice age and subsequently flooded by postglacial sea level rise. The tidal range is usually small. Accordingly, coastal lagoons are frequently found in warm temperate, dry subtropical, or Mediterranean regions along moderately sheltered coasts. Lagoons are infrequent in wetter temperate and tropical regions where freshwater inflows are sufficient to scour out river mouths and keep them open. Here estuaries are dominated by salt marshes in temperate and mangroves in tropical climes. A particularly good example is the series of coastal habitats on the southern and eastern coastline of Australia which change from open temperate estuaries and salt marshes in the wetter southern regions of Tasmania, through a series of coastal lagoons of varying sizes and ecologies along the south and east coasts, to open subtropical and tropical estuaries, reefs, and mangroves in the warmer and wetter north. A similar, although inverted, sequence can be seen running south along the east coasts of Canada, and the northeastern, central, and southeastern coasts of the USA. The resulting lagoons have varying water residence times, depending on volume, climate, freshwater inflow volumes, and the tidal prism. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper documents a novel procedure for assessing the vulnerability of an open-coast dune system to tsunami hazard. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analyses of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are employed to classify a range of dune topographies in terms of four tsunami inundation scenarios, run-up to 3, 6, 8, and 10 m above mean sea level, along the coast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Analysis reveals two key characteristics which together define the tsunami vulnerability of a narrow vegetated dune system: (i) the elevation or average height of the dune ridge and (ii) the continuity or standard deviation of height of its longshore profile. We find that the Christchurch dune coast currently offers a high degree of protection against inundation from small to medium tsunami (run-up ,6 m above mean sea level), with the degree of vulnerability under more extreme scenarios varying longshore in relation to the height and continuity of the dune system and its vegetation. A tsunami inundation vulnerability index is developed to assist coastal managers in quickly assessing the relative vulnerability of sections of dune, while simultaneously identifying the nature and location of weaknesses. At the local level this index may be used to effectively allocate management resources, while at a regional level it can be used in coastal development and hazard planning. Relative to current field survey-based methods of determining tsunami inundation risk, the GIS-based procedures and vulnerability index developed here offer significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency at local to regional scales.

AB  - Planktonic foraminifera and radiolaria have been analysed in a Late Quaternary (40-0 ka) sediment sequence from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 658C located under a coastal upwelling system near Cap Blanc, offshore northwest Africa, in order to document the palaeoceanographic history of the area. Temporal variations in species abundance and faunal assemblage analysis reveal a tripartite phased sequence of palaeoceanographic change through the Late Quaternary. Phase 1 spans 40-14.5 ka and is characterised by moderate Upwelling, but Heinrich event 2 is distinguished as a brief episode of strengthened upwelling. Phase 2 begins with a change in a number journal Of Quaternary Science of variables at ca. 14.5 ka and extends to ca. 5.5 ka. This phase is characterised by a general strengthening of upwelling, but may be subdivided into three minor phases including (a) the recognition of the Younger Dryas, marked by a temporary reduction in upwelling strength, followed by (b) an intensification of upwelling, and (c) upwelling and high productivity between 8 and 5.5 ka. This phase of Upwelling corresponds with maximum Holocene cooling, possibly triggered by the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet. Phase 3 extends from 5.5 to Oka and is characterised by weak Upwelling and significant calcite dissolution. These phases are related to climatic events, particularly the African Humid Period (AHP), which is coincident with Phase 2. The AHP is characterised by increased precipitation, linked to an intensification of the African monsoon that enhances North East Trade Wind-driven coastal Upwelling and is associated with the expansion of continental vegetation across North Africa.

AB  - The effects of climate change on the near shore coastal environment including ocean acidification, accelerated erosion, destruction of coral reefs, and damage to marine habitat have highlighted the need for improved equipment to study, monitor, and evaluate these changes [1]. This is especially true where areas of study are remote, large, or beyond depths easily accessible to divers. To this end, we have developed three examples of low cost and easily deployable real-time ocean observation platforms. We followed a scalable design approach adding complexity and capability as familiarity and experience were gained with system components saving both time and money by reducing design mistakes. The purpose of this paper is to provide information for the researcher, technician, or engineer who finds themselves in need of creating or acquiring similar platforms.

AB  - From its inception as an object of study, salt marshes were conceived as a form of continual accumulation. For more than a century this paradigm structured the understanding of tidal marshes in Canada's St. Lawrence estuary and was used by physical and human geographers, biologists, agronomists, and ecologists to encourage marsh reclamation as a form of collaboration with nature. In the 1980s, this school of thought abruptly gave way to a school of generalized erosion. This new paradigm, resulting from the scientific and social reaction to the Anthropocene and the advent of applied research in risk management, underlies a crisis narrative used to promote intervention by concerned actors to protect marshes and human infrastructure. Although the changing socioeconomy of salt marshes is well known, the evolution of scientific thinking about them continues to be depicted in positivist terms. Critical reflection on salt marshes as a social construction of nature, however, demonstrates a clear chain of links between cultural values, scientific practices, and research outcomes. Lack of recognition of this subject-object problem impedes the current investigation of salt marsh dynamics as a function of both erosion and growth processes. ?????????????,?????????????? ????,????????????????????????????,????????????????????,??????????????,???????????1980??,?????????????????????????,???????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????,??????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????? Desde su inclusion como objeto de estudio, las marismas se concibieron como una forma de acumulacion continua. Durante mas de un siglo este paradigma estructuro la comprension de los pantanos de marea en el estuario del San Lorenzo, en Canada, y fue usado por geografos fisicos y humanos, biologos, agronomos y ecologos para estimular la reclamacion de los pantanos como una forma de colaboracion con la naturaleza. En los anos 1980, esta escuela de pensamiento abruptamente cedio el paso a una escuela de erosion generalizada. Este nuevo paradigma, que resulto de la reaccion cientifica y social al Antropoceno y del advenimiento de la investigacion aplicada al manejo de riesgos, subraya una narrativa de crisis usada para promover la intervencion de actores interesados para proteger los pantanos y la infraestructura humana. A pesar de que la cambiante socioeconomia de las marismas es bien conocida, la evolucion del modo de pensar cientifico sobre ellas sigue siendo representada en terminos positivistas. La reflexion critica sobre las marismas como una construccion social de la naturaleza demuestra, sin embargo, una clara cadena de eslabones entre los valores culturales, las practicas cientificas y los resultados de las investigaciones. La falta de reconocimiento de este problema sujeto-objeto es un obstaculo a la actual investigacion de la dinamica de las marismas como una funcion por igual de la erosion y los procesos de crecimiento.

AB  - The inner 1/3 of Isahaya Bay which is a tributary of Ariake Sea in Japan was shut off from the sea by a dike for the reclamation and disaster prevention in 1997. On the other hand, several environmental and fisheries problems occurred in Ariake Sea after 1990s. Some fishermen insisted that the major reason for the decrease of fishing must be the influence of the dike construction and filed lawsuits. Now the court decision is fixed and Japanese government must open the gates to reintroduce sea water into the reservoir. We made numerical simulations of currents, hydrography and sediment transport to assess the influences of the gate opening. To choose the environmentally wise procedure of gate opening, it is needed to reduce the erosion and deposition of bottom sediments caused by the enhanced tidal current and to minimize the occurrence of hypoxia in the reservoir.

AB  - To gain a better understanding of the cycles of shoreline changes on Seabrook Island, South Carolina and advise a private developer on how to deal with localized erosion problems, a detailed field survey and historical study were completed. The data base included historical charts dating from 1661, vertical aerial photographs from 1939, field surveys of beach profiles and nearshore bathymetry over a six-month period, and sediment cores through the entire Holocene section. Seabrook Island, less than 6 km in length, is bounded by tidal inlets with extensive seaward shoals. With a 2 m tidal range for the area, changing exposure and orientation of the shoals over time has had a profound effect on the adjacent shoreline of Seabrook Island. Historical evidence points to the importance of offshore shoals which act as natural breakwaters and sediment storage systems. At various times in recent history, these shoals have supplied sediment to Seabrook beaches by means of bypassing mechanisms around tidal inlets. On the other hand, migration of shoals has allowed excess wave energy to strike portions of the shore causing local erosion. Along a portion of the shoreline, short-term erosion is jeopardizing the development. Based on the present study, a set of “soft” engineering designs was proposed which attempt to manipulate offshore sand bodies in a way that will be beneficial to the development and preserve the inherent beauty of the shoreline. Remedial measures recommended for the developer included dredging new inlet channels and construction of a breakwater in the position of a former protective shoal.

AB  - Much of the low-lying farmland around the coastline of south-cast England was once inter-tidal salt marsh, which was subsequently reclaimed from the sea and converted to farmland. It is becoming increasingly uneconomic to maintain the embankments which protect this land from the sea. 'Managed retreat' involves relocating the embankments further inland and recreating inter-tidal habitat in front of them. Salt marsh not only provides a protective buffer for these sea walls by dissipating wave energy, but is also important as a habitat for birds and as a source of organic matter for fish and inter-tidal fauna. When 'managed retreat' takes place, the creation of inter-tidal habitat occurs on soils that have undergone physical and chemical changes, some of which are irreversible. However, the indications are that rapid sedimentation creates conditions in which salt marsh plants germinate and become established; soil salinity rises quickly to a level which restricts competition from terrestrial plants, and deposited sediment is relatively rich in available phosphorus. The physical properties of the old agricultural soil influence the subsequent development of creeks.

AB  - Waterfront infrastructure represents a significant investment and owners have a vested interest in maintaining and extending the service life of these aging assets. Exposed to the harsh marine environment, these assets are subject to degradation more than most non-marine assets. In addition, most owners are interested in protecting life safety and the environment through proactive and cost-effective maintenance. Recognizing these drivers, the ASCE/COPRI Ports & Harbors Committee's Waterfront Inspection Task Committee has developed a new manual to guide the inspection of waterfront assets. The new manual, "Waterfront Facilities Inspection and Assessment Standard Practice Manual," provides comprehensive guidance for the inspection and maintenance of waterfront structures both above water and underwater, as well as associated mooring hardware, fender systems, utilities, and appurtenant features. Eight inspection types are defined in the manual, with each inspection performed for a specific purpose using a tailored scope of work. Inspection types may also be combined and performed simultaneously. The eight inspection types include: ≤ Routine Inspection ≤ Structural Repair or Upgrade Inspection ≤ New Construction Inspection ≤ Baseline Inspection ≤ Due Diligence Inspection ≤ Special Inspection ≤ Repair Construction Inspection ≤ Post-Event Inspection The manual provides guidance on modeling service life using software such as STADIUM® to provide quantitative solutions to extending the life of waterfront structures. The manual covers every type of waterfront structure type commonly in use. Specific guidance is provided on the nuances of each structure type and the defects commonly found.

AB  - The city of Mangalore is situated at the confluence of rivers Gurpur and Netravati. Two spits are formed in this area, i.e., northern spit of "Bengre" and the southern spit of "Ullar" as the rivers flow close and parallel to the seashore for some distance. The spits have been subjected to constant geomorphological changes in length, width, position, accretion and erosion patterns etc, for the past several decades. A seawall was constructed in 1984 around the tip of Bengre spit and another one along the shoreline of Ullal spit in 1987. by the Government of Karnataka in order to prevent the spits from being eroded. Two breakwaters were also constructed in 1992 near the estuaries mouth as part of the development of old Mangalore Port. The paper presents the results of a study undertaken to identify the geomorphologic changes that occurred in the area, using IRS-1A/1C data for the years of 1988, 1994, 1996. The study clearly demonstrated that the IRS data could be effectively utilized for monitoring the geodynamics of an area. It was observed that the spits were highly unstable earlier. However, the construction of seawalls was helpful in arresting the migration of the estuaries mouth and in stabilizing the spits against coastal erosion.

AB  - ABSTRACT Freshwater marshes cover 4000 square kilometers of the Louisiana coastal zone and are the most abundant marsh habitat type. Many of these marshes actually float as organic mats on underlying water. Some estimates suggest as much as 70% of Louisiana's coastal freshwater marsh are of the floating variety. The slow flow of water characteristic of these environments generally transports very little sediment. As a result, the marsh substrate is composed of primarily live and dead organic matter (peat formation) rather than mineral sediments. Since floating marshes are structurally different than intertidal marsh habitats, many traditional oil spill response options are ineffective or inappropriate. Access to the marsh is often limited since there is no open water ingress and the marsh structure cannot support the weight of equipment. Oil spill response options are further complicated when the source of the oil is a pipeline leak located below the floating marsh mat; spilled oil is free to travel at the interface of the underlying water and mat. Protection booming is impossible. Oil impacts often result in the death of all the living plants that are integral to the formation and sustainability of the habitat. This paper reports on two oil spills in a floating marsh near Paradis, Louisiana that occurred eight years apart. Both spills were spatially close to each other, which provided an excellent comparison for assessing potential long-term impact from oil spills in floating marshes. During both oil spill responses, unique response techniques were developed to recover spilled oil and enhance marsh recovery. An effective technique was to rake away and remove the dead oil-contaminated surface plant debris from the site and employ sorbent recovery. Lessons learned from these responses were used to develop mitigation guidance for future responses.

AB  - It is generally considered that nitrogen availability is one of the major factors regulating primary production in temperate coastal marine environments. Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea- grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria.

AB  - In order to achieve compliance with their Consumptive Use Permit for groundwater withdrawals, Tampa Bay Water, a regional water supply authority on the west coast of Florida, needed to implement a new surface water supply by December 31, 2002 in order to reduce pumping from their stressed well fields. This was accomplished by a fast-track design and construction program that built two new surface water intakes and pump stations that connected to a new treatment plant via 14 miles of 72- and 84-in. transmission mains. The alignment of the new pipelines required the acquisition of over 120 separate easements. Because the land acquisition was ongoing during the design phase, access was not available to certain properties for collecting geotechnical data prior to bidding and awarding the construction contract. Only after the contractor was mobilized and under construction was it determined that one of the designated wetlands that needed to be crossed consisted of muck and peat extending to depths ranging from 50 to 70 ft below land surface. It immediately became apparent that it would be cost prohibitive to remove and replace the unsuitable material with backfill capable of supporting the 72-in. steel pipe. Installing the pipe in the native material was the only available option. Because of the unsuitable nature of the soil, settlement of the full pipe during dry periods and flotation of the empty pipe during wet conditions were factors that had to be quickly evaluated and addressed without delaying the contractor. Working with the pipe manufacturer, American Spiralweld Pipe, the design engineers, Camp Dresser & KcKee Inc., considered alternative pipe support methods and developed a pipe hanger system that utilized helical anchors similar to those used in underpinning structures. Structural cross beams and cradles were designed to handle the dead load and bouyant forces that could develop over the design life of the pipeline. To maximize the use of pipe material already fabricated, the pipe manufacturer reorganized the laying schedule and factory cut the 45-ft pieces into two 22.5-ft pieces that could be installed by the smaller equipment that had to be used due to the soil bearing limitations of the dewatered wetland. The pipe manufacturer also designed and manufactured wrapper plates and stiffener rings that could be field installed to allow the existing pipe to perform within the specified ring deflection as if it were installed in an aerial crossing. Without the close coordination and teamwork exhibited by the design engineer and the pipe manufacturer, the project would have experienced significant delays and subsequent fines associated with violating the permit conditions. This paper outlines the steps taken by both parties to expedite submittal preparation, reviews and approvals necessary to maintain the critical schedule for completion.

AB  - In the Ems-Dollard estuary at the southern North Sea coast a revaluation of design water levels along the German dykes has become necessary, since the safety margin for sea level rise was increased by 25 cm due to a decision of the Lower Saxon Ministry for Environment and Climate Protection. The upstream part of the estuary is protected against high storm surges by a storm surge barrier. The closure of the barrier effects downstream surge water levels due to partial reflection. Deterministic-mathematical modeling is applied to evaluate design water levels and design wave run-up. Three severe storm surge events have been hindcasted by a cascade of three hierarchical models from the Continental Shelf over the German Bight into the area of interest. The models are forced by non-stationary and spatially varying data of atmospheric pressure, wind velocities and directions available of meteorological model investigations. The verification of the storm surge model with water level observations yields good agreements. With respect to legal boundary conditions, the single-value-method is applied to determine the highest expected high water level at Emden. Starting from this target water level, the wind velocities in the meteorological boundary conditions are increased with the aim to increase the surge level at the coast and to match the predetermined design water level at Emden. The responding water levels in the Ems-Dollard estuary assign the new design water levels.

AB  - Plant communities are vital to maintaining diverse coastal and estuarine ecosystems in Louisiana's Deltaic and Chenier Plains. These plant assemblages provide not only primary productivity but also structural stability to terrestrial (supratidal) and aquatic (inter- and subtidal) substrates, thereby creating diverse habitats for many important estuarine and coastal fauna. Barrier islands are an important and dynamic component of the coastal landscape with plant assemblages ranging from terrestrial dune habitats to swales and intertidal back-barrier marshes. Barrier islands provide protection for bayward submersed aquatic vegetation and interior salt marsh plant assemblages by reducing wave energy and allowing shallow water habitats to exist over large expanses. Further landward, vast expanses of brackish, intermediate, and fresh marsh habitat make up Louisiana's extensive coastal marsh ecosystems. Louisiana's barrier islands have migrated landward and decreased in size through time as overwash events have become more frequent in this sand-deficient system. In the absence of restoration efforts to bring sand resources back into the system, island degradation will result in significant reductions in habitat diversity and loss of protection of mainland resources. This article provides an overview of Louisiana's coastal plant communities, emphasizing the key role of barrier island plant communities in the deltaic landscape. The companion article focuses on the animal resources of the Louisiana Gulf shoreline.

AB  - The Island of Sylt was formed by the deposits of ice ages and the succeeding sea level rises. The history of the coastal defences began for about 150 years. But the cross-shore and alongshore measures like groynes, walls and revetments couldn't achieve sustained effect against the long-term retreat. With the beginning of sand nourishments in the year 1972, respectively 1984, it was possible to stop the further erosion of cliffs and dunes. The annual loss of sand along the west coast is estimated to approximately 1 million cubic meters. Beside the natural retreat of the beaches also the offshore suffers a negative volume development, especially towards the northern and southern spits. The island grows northwards and south-eastwards. During storm surges the sand is relocated towards the sea and afterwards the beaches are recovered by some extend. Thus, the total loss is only due to the residual alongshore transport. The costs of nourishments could be lowered since the measures were tendered for longer periods. Another way to reduce the costs is to put in the nourished sand in front of the beach. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - To design a coastal structure constructed on a fringing reef, it is important to estimate not only wave height reduction but also wave setup and surf-beat distribution, because they can cause sea-level rise in front of the coastal structure, and increase wave force and wave overtopping rate on it. In this study, a series of numerical experiments is conducted by using a Boussinesq wave model to especially reveal the characteristics of surf-beat distribution, after the wave breaking model based on a one-equation turbulence model is modified through the verification with experimental results.

AB  - This preliminary survey comprises a collection of fluoride concentration data for air, water, soil, vegetation and marine samples obtained both specifically for this paper, and from the hitherto unpublished results of others, in the vicinity of a large aluminum smelter operating at the head of Kitimat Arm, a typical Canadian west coast fjord with high rainfall. The significance of the fluoride distribution and dispersion processes derived from this data matrix and from special leaching tests using water, dilute acids, and aqueous sodium bicarbonate is considered in the light of prevailing temperature, wind and precipitation patterns with regard to the plant, animal, and marine life of the area. The most recent data available are further related to the time of complete installation of dry scrubber emission control devices to determine how ambient air, water, soil, and vegetation concentrations may be responding to the reduced air and water mass emissions rates.

AB  - The ecological importance of saltmarshes has gained increasing attention. This is mirrored in the Schleswig-Holstein State Environmental Act of 1993. According to this Act saltmarshes have a very high ecological value. Hence, they are protected and natural processes must prevail. In order to realise these regulations a saltmarsh management plan was established in co-operation between coastal defence and environmental authorities. This plan contains a common principle for future management, a number of regional management plans as maps, an examination of techniques used and a monitoring programme. Common principle is to preserve existing salt-marshes. Where no saltmarshes exist in front of dikes they must be created.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change constitutes a main challenge for the Wadden Sea. Accelerated sea level rise, increasing temperatures and changing wind climate may strongly alter present structures and functions of the ecosystem with negative consequences both for nature conservation and for coastal risk management. Being aware of these challenges, Schleswig-Holstein State Government decided to establish an integrated climate change adaptation strategy for the Schleswig-Holstein sector of the Wadden Sea. The strategy was adopted in June 2015. It aims at the long-term maintenance of present functions and structures as well as the integrity of the Wadden Sea ecosystem in a changing climate. The strategy was prepared by a project group consisting of representatives from State authorities as well as from nature conservation organisations and local institutions. First outcome of the strategy is that extra adaptation measures will not be necessary in the coming decades. However, pending on the future rate of sea level rise, shoreline erosion and sediment deficits in the Wadden Sea will increase and sooner or later drowning of tidal flats and terrestrial habitats like beaches, primary dunes and salt marshes will start. At the time when management measures to counteract the negative developments become expedient from a nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal risk management, adequate actions with minimized ecological interferences are possible. It is assumed that balancing the sediment deficits as the main adaptation measure may be implemented most efficiently by concentrating sediment suppletion at locations where natural forces organize redistribution in the Wadden Sea. Local technical coastal risk management measures like the strengthening of sea defences will, nevertheless, remain necessary as well.

AB  - The Yellow River delta is one of the most active regions in the world, where wetlands play a significant role in balancing the regional eco-environment. However, in past decades, it has been subjected to severe disturbance by nature and by humans. Thus, it is critical to figure out what changes have occurred during this period and what could be done in this region now to protect the local wetland system. Therefore, in this study, we took Landsat satellite imagery from 9 years (1973, 1979, 1985, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013) as data sources to build wetland thematic databases using the method of visual interpretation. Based on these databases, a Surface Wetland and Construction State Index (SWCSI) was constructed to indicate the state of the land cover. These were combined with Yellow River runoff and sediment data, regional precipitation, local GDP, aquatic product output, and crude salt output. Then, the driving forces and corresponding spatial heterogeneity of wetland variations in the past 40 years in regions of the Yellow River delta were quantitatively analyzed at regional and pixel scales. From this research, we concluded that the area of wetland in the Yellow River Delta declined during the years 1973-2013, accompanied by large-scale conversion of natural wetlands to artificial wetlands and non-wetland. In the past 40 years, the area of natural wetlands decreased by 42.67% (annual reduction of 30.58 km2). In contrast, the area of artificial wetlands increased by 490.52% (annual increase of 24.47 km2). As a result, the total wetland area was reduced by 7.99% (annual reduction of 6.13 km2). The variations of wetland in the Yellow River delta showed high spatial heterogeneities. Wetlands in coastal regions experienced artificial enhancement or wetland degradation, while those in estuarine regions experienced wetland construction and development; however, there were no changes in the western and southwestern traditional farming districts. On the regional scale, GDP was the dominant driving force for wetland variation in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 40 years, intensifying human activities and decreasing Yellow River runoff and sediment made a number of important changes (decreases in natural wetlands, increase in artificial wetlands, and degradation of regional wetlands) more serious. In contrast, a large area of natural wetland was constructed and developed in the estuary of the Yellow River because of the continuous runoff and sediment supply, although there has been an overall decline in these factors during the past 40 years. Therefore, the Yellow River runoff and sediment still played an important role in the evolution of wetlands in the Yellow River Delta, but this role was not very significant because these influences were regionally limited. The influence of regional precipitation on wetland evolution was extremely limited. This was perhaps due to the severe dependence of the regional wetlands on runoff. At the pixel scale, the driving factors of evolution of the Yellow River delta wetlands showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. This was mainly due to the spatial heterogeneity of driving force factors themselves. © 2016, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite that the life histories of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are very well studied, there are still gaps in our knowledge which have consequences for management and conservation of these species. This is of particular importance now that wild populations of Atlantic salmon and anadromous brown trout are decreasing throughout their distribution range. This thesis aims to address some of these gaps in knowledge in life stage specific habitat use and mortality of these two species by bringing together five separate studies. Regular assessment of stock size is one of the most important aspects of fisheries management. Electrofishing techniques are widely used for the estimation of the size of stream dwelling fish populations for both fishery management and scientific study. In contrast to multiple pass, population depletion methods, single pass catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) methods are less time consuming and labour intensive. A possible issue with the commonly used, fixed total time CPUE protocol is that it does not differentiate between the time spent actively fishing and the time incurred while not actively fishing, leading to handling error which is likely related to fish density. This was tested in a comparative field study. I showed that this commonly used technique is systematically underestimating juvenile salmonid numbers at higher densities. In addition this technique is failing to adequately determine fish community structure at low population densities. This work indicates a simple modification to the methodology that will reduce systematic error. Knowledge of the species’ biology and habitat requirements can be linked with habitat data to create a model that predicts the distribution of that species. As salmonids, such as Atlantic salmon, have fairly strict habitat requirements, knowledge of habitat use by salmon can then be used to estimate the potential salmonid production in a given area of certain quality. The accuracy of a habitat grading system currently used by the Loughs Agency was tested. The results suggest that in its current format, the habitat grading system does not accurately describe the abundance of juvenile salmonids. When data was analysed to see which habitat variables best described salmonid density, for 0+ salmon important variables were flow and substrate and for older juveniles the important variables were flow, substrate, depth and percentage of undercut banks. All populations are controlled by density-dependent and density –independent factors. For a species such as Atlantic salmon that has life stages differing in habitat requirements, the relative contributions of these two factors for population regulation on each life stage are likely to vary. Using a long-term data-set on Atlantic salmon migrants returning to the Foyle catchment, Ireland, the role of density-dependent and life-stage specific environmental factors regulating population size was determined. A Ricker density-dependent model showed that the spawning adult population size significantly predicted variation in the resultant filial generation, however a large amount of variation remained unexplained. It was shown that environmental factors were significant in explaining some of the remaining variance and that these influences were linked to specific life stages. Three life stages – spawning and incubation, fry emergence, and marine survival – were shown to be sensitive to environmental effects resulting in changes to the returning cohort strength. It is concluded that these life stage specific environmental effects are likely to contribute to the stochastic variation in population size resulting from the application of traditional stock-recruitment models. Atlantic salmon undertake extensive migrations between freshwater and marine habitats. Smolt migration is associated with high mortality and is thus considered a critical life stage in the Atlantic salmon life history. Smolt migration through standing waters is still mostly an unknown process and it is not known what guides migration during lake migration. Using acoustic telemetry, three hypotheses derived from known principles of migration in rivers were tested: i.) smolts will take the shortest possible route, ii.) smolts will display unidirectional movement and iii.) smolts will be continuously moving. None of these three expectations were supported by the results of this study. Instead evidence was found of smolts moving in a seemingly random fashion, displaying counter intuitive migration patterns and spending relatively long periods effectively static during their lake migration. Brown trout display a great range of life history variation ranging from river residency to anadromy. Unlike Atlantic salmon that migrate hundreds of kilometres to the open ocean to feed, anadromous brown trout often stay within 80-100 km from their natal river in coastal areas. Despite this, very little is still known about their behaviour during this coastal feeding part of the life cycle. It was found that brown trout in the Clyde estuary use a fairly small part of the estuary and seem to move fairly actively. Fish size did not explain any of the movement or residency patterns. The five separate studies presented in this thesis combine field empirical studies from rivers, lakes and the coastal marine environments and historical data analysis studies on two salmonid species. The results presented in this thesis provide tools for managers of anadromous salmonids.

AB  - Due to their dynamic mode of operation, waste treatment pond and activated sludge plant effluents always contain quite large amounts of nitrogen relative to those found in natural lakes, streams, and oceans. Typical activated sludge plant effluents contain 25 mgl -1 N, mostly as ammonia. In most aquatic milieux, concentrations of ammonia > 1 mgl -1 N are potentially toxic to fish and other wildlife. Nitrification and denitrification of activated sludge plant effluent alleviates the ammonia problem at a considerable cost but the discharges still usually contain over 10 mgl -1 NO 3 -N which exceeds the WHO standard for drinking water. A great advantage of waste treatment pond effluents is that nitrogen is normally already present as nitrate or particulate-N (algae and bacteria), and nitrate concentrations are -1 NO 3 -N. However, even 1 mgl -1 of nitrate-N is sufficient to cause eutrophication in unpolluted lakes, streams, and oceans and some of the particulate-N discharged will be recycled to give eutrophication downstream. Where sufficient diluting water is available, these higher effluent concentrations are not a problem. Unfortunately, clean diluting water is becoming a scarce commodity in many areas, particularly the 17 semi-arid states in the USA and in most developing countries where rainfall is needed for drinking water and wildlife support. One solution for nitrogen removal is new design for free surface constructed wetlands which have considerable potential for nitrogen polishing of waste treatment pond effluents. Particulate-N can be removed by using wetlands as large filters but the nitrogen often recycles and is released as ammonia in winter and spring. Denitrification of nitrate to N 2 gas removes the problem permanently. In particular, the relatively low BOD, high nitrate and low ammonia effluent from some stabilization ponds is ideal for nitrate removal (denitrification) by free surface wetlands. Rates of nitrate removal of 200 to over 5,000 mg N m -2 d -1 can be achieved with initial nitrate values of 2-14 mgl -1 NO 3 -N. These rates are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than occur in most natural lake, estuarine or wetlands sediments and can be mostly attributed to denitrification rather than growth of rooted plants. In two weeks 20 mgl -1 NO 3 -N can be reduced to less than 1 mgl -1 . After wetlands treatment the water is suitable for release into water-depleted live streams or lakes where a low eutrophication potential is vital for native biota. It is recommended that pond effluent be routed thorough constructed wetlands whenever possible since both better water quality and wildlife benefits occur.

AB  - Coastal areas are economically vital in terms of population, industry, trade and tourism. The numbers of people and properties at risk will increase as economies grow or develop, while climate change will amplify the likelihood of extreme events, as well as accelerate potential habitat decline. The development of a systematic approach to deliver both a low-risk coast for human use and healthy habitats subject to multiple change factors is envisaged within the European project THESEUS of which this study forms a part. Plymouth Sound to Exe Estuary (UK) is one of several project sites. This site involves complex coastal and estuarine processes; interactions between coastal defence structures, coastal morphology and ecological habitats; and significant economic, social and environmental impacts, which makes a really interesting and challenging site to study. The source-pathway-receptor-consequence or 'S-P-R-C' methodology was adopted to identify the risk of flooding and erosion. This method is a simple conceptual model for representing systems and processes that lead to a particular consequence. Sources, pathways and receptors have been identified and defined in a GIS system, the information for the sources was derived from tide gauges at Plymouth and Exmouth, simulated surge and wave conditions derived from running POLCOMS (over 4 × 30 year time slices) for present conditions and the A1B scenario (short-, mid- and long-term). Pathway information was obtained from a variety of sources but largely from the UK Environment Agency databases. Receptors were defined on the basis of land use obtained from the CORINE database from the European Environment Agency, terrain elevation data and defence type. It is concluded that should the extreme changes for the four main sources (mean sea-level, waves surge and river flow) coincide, the impact would be catastrophic if land usage remains as it is today. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - There has been considerable research into the science of global climate change, however, there is presently little guidance for coastal authorities on accounting for the physical impacts of ongoing climate change in future land use planning and coastal defence policy. For the central south coast of England, this paper briefly identifies 'coastal climate change scenarios'for the next 80 years. A qualitative geomorphological appraisal of the potential impacts of these changes on coastal landforms and processes is presented, based upon generic 'coastal behaviour systems' that take account of the various sensitivities to change of the natural and managed coastline. Functions such as the sensitivity of coastal slopes to increasing effective rainfall, and barrier beaches to increased water levels, are considered. The likely future 'behaviour' of these systems, and in particular the potential for climate-induced changes, are identified. The likely response of the coastal systems then provides an objective framework for evaluating hazard and risk. The levels of risk are strongly linked to the historic pattern of land use and development, which in many cases will not accommodate natural adjustment of coastal features. Without effective management, hazards will increase and coastal communities will be vulnerable and at risk under future climate change. Recommendations are made regarding improving the risk management framework in the face of climate change impacts. Recommendations include issues such as compensation, the planning framework, coastal defence provision, nature conservation, data collection and education. Although the results are specific to the study area, the methodology developed is transferable, offering a valuable model for other coastal managers. © 2002 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Data on the mobile epifauna of the Oosterschelde estuary, collected by beam trawl, were compiled from several studies. Multivariate statistical techniques brought out the fact that the Oosterschelde, when compared with neighbouring areas, has a characteristic epibenthic fauna. Diversity as measured by Hill's diversity numbers N through N + ∞, is higher for the Oosterschelde (N1 = 4.5) than for the Voordelta (N1 = 3.5) and the Westerschelde (N1 = 2.2). Four epifaunal communities can be distinguished within the Oosterschelde, the two most seaward communities being the richest. Annual production is estimated at about 6 gADW m-2 yr-1, annual consumption is estimated at over 25 gADW m-2 yr-1. These results are highly dependent on the assumptions. Over 85% of the epibenthic production and consumption in the Oosterschelde is accounted for by only six species: starfish Asterias rubens, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, bib Trisopterus luscus, brown shrimp Crangon crangon, shore crab Carcinus maenas and dab Limanda limanda. In spite of its abundance, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus contributes little to the production. From the available data it is difficult to assess the impact of the construction of the storm-surge barrier and the compartmentalization dams on the epibenthic fauna. The increase in flatfish in the Hammen area is probably linked to the decrease in current velocities in that area. On the other hand the increase in the gadoids bib and whiting Merlangius merlangus is predominantly due to the stronger year classes in the post-barrier time period. Lower nutrient inputs through the Northern branch, in combination with the increase of the gadoids, may have caused the decline of the brown shrimp in the Oosterschelde. A decrease has also been observed in the sandeel Ammodytes tobianus and the hooknose Agonus cataphractus. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - In view of the features of low temperature and high salt in estuary wetland, two coldtolerance and salt-tolerance strains were separated from the Liaohe estuary wetlands in surface sediments and domesticated HXN-1 and HXN-2, respectively. Two strains are identified as Ochrobactrum sp. and Aquamicrobium sp. In addition, single factor experiments (pH, C/N and petroleum hydrocarbons) were used to study the effect on ammonia oxidation of two ammonia oxidation bacteria. The results showed that the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is significantly inhibited under too high or too low pH, the optimum pH range is 7–9; the efficiency reduced with the increase of C/N, the highest ammonia oxidation efficiency are 88.89% and 90.18% respectively, which is achieved without organic matter. With the increasing concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons enhance the inhibition to ammonia oxidation efficiency. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - The Great Brak is a temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) located on the south coast of South Africa. The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing t he mouth to breach less often. The aim of t his study was to investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH super( +) sub( 4), TOxN [NO super( -) sub( 3) + NO super( -) sub( 2)], SRP) as well as total N and P across the sediment-water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed t hat t he sediment had a net efflux of NH super( +) sub( 4), SRP, TN and TP while TOx N was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and w inter. If the estuary remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the bent hos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing met hods or, more importantly, a n increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.

AB  - Most theories on the equilibrium shape of estuarine basins highlight the dominance of tidal asymmetry in controlling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic feedbacks that ultimately lead to a stable morphological state. This thesis uses field measurements, numerical modelling and sediment deposition records to investigate how waves interact with tidal processes and how these interactions influence sediment transport and the non-linear feedbacks between hydrodynamics and estuarine basin morphology. Numerical modelling experiments were conducted over a series of idealised estuaries representing different stages of infilling, which show that wind and waves are far more efficient than tides at shaping intertidal areas, with the effect being subtly dependent on the depth distribution in the intertidal. Moreover, the wind and wave climate can substantially alter the hydrodynamic regime over the entire estuary and in intertidal areas can exert a much greater control on asymmetry than tidal currents alone, which dominate in the deeper channels. Under the effect of tides alone, currents over intertidal flats are to found to remain flood-dominant as the estuary infills, thus promoting continued accretion until tidal currents become too weak to entrain sediment. Therefore, estuaries with only tidal currents are likely to evolve into in-filled areas of salt-marsh or mangrove with drainage channels, whereas fetch-aligned estuaries (in which wind-waves are common) have a greater probability of attaining deeper hydrodynamically-maintained stable intertidal areas. Although waves have little direct influence on hydrodynamics within the subtidal channel, the tidal asymmetry is controlled by the height and volume of the intertidal areas and therefore is indirectly influenced by wave activity. The higher-energy, infrequent storm-wave events can considerably modify estuarine morphology over short timescales whereas lower-energy but perpetual effects like the tides operate continuously and so the relative contribution of such events in shaping the long-term morphological evolution can be considered on a range of timescales. Within this thesis a combination of hydrodynamic measurements, sediment deposition records and numerical modelling are used to determine the conditions under which observed waves are morphologically significant. Morphological significance is defined as when waves influence tidal and suspended sediment flux asymmetry and subsequently infilling over geomorphological timescales. By comparing a fetch-aligned and a non fetch-aligned mesotidal basin, it is shown that for a sufficiently large fetch, even small and frequently occurring wind events are able to create waves that are morphologically significant. Conversely, in basins with a reduced fetch, wave events are less frequent and therefore of far less morphological significance. The role of tidal range in controlling sediment transport is investigated through consideration of its influence on bed shear stress, tmax. The decrease in bed shear stress associated with greater water depths is compared to increases owing to the larger fetch that accompanies the increased tidal range and the generally stronger currents associated with larger tidal range. Here, it is shown that during neap tides the reduction in water depths around high water and tidal currents are not offset by the reduction in fetch. Thus, it is shown that the basin-averaged tmax is similar during both spring and neap tides in addition to the shorter duration of slack water during neap tides. Consequently, as tmax is lower in the subtidal channel during neaps, the sediment gradient (and hence sediment transport potential) between tidal flats and channels is greater. Thus it is concluded that sediment deposition potential may actually be increased during a neap tide. This result is in sharp contrast to previous observations from microtidal wave-dominated environments, in which differences between spring and neap result in increased erosion during spring tides. Overall, this thesis shows that short period local y enerated waves can be considered a morphologically significant hydrodynamic process within estuaries. With increased fetch, waves become more morphologically significant relative to tides as even low, frequent wind speeds are able to generate waves that are capable of controlling patterns of sediment transport.

AB  - A review is given on the purposes, scope and present state of oceanographic modeling, with reference to existing and potential management applications. Particular attention is paid to predictive numerical models. Forecast models of tides, meteorologically driven surges and waves in shelf seas are perhaps furthest developed, and are particularly relevant to coastal protection, coastal and offshore engineering and navigation. Such models can also be used to improve statistical estimates of extreme and long-term conditions for design purposes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the introduction of the emulsified fuel, ORIMULSION®, to the power generation market in the early nineties, significant work has been undertaken studying the behaviour of response to, and potential cleanup techniques for a possible spill of this fuel. The studies have in particular been carried out by sponsorships funded by BITOR, the producer of ORIMULSION®, but an important part has also been sponsored by US and Canadian government agencies. One of the most recent contributions is the report, “Spills of Emulsified Fuels, Risks and Response” a project under the US National Research Council (NRC). To date there have been no significant spills of ORIMULSION® to enable full scale use, under real life cleanup conditions, of the various conventional and new techniques and technologies, which have been developed and tested for the purpose. However, several developments and tests over the past decade and especially over the past three years, sponsored by BITOR, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG), and Environment Canada (EC), combined with a sound portion of experience with the response to spills of heavy oil, make it most relevant to present a hands-on review of the available response options. Since ORIMULSION® has a surfactant added in the form of its emulsifying surfactant, a spill at open sea may be considered a spill of a pre-dispersed oil. Consequently, the preferred offshore response methodology would be to monitor the naturally dispersed bitumen plume. Therefore, this paper will mainly cover monitoring and response to near-shore and dockside spills in salt-, brackish-, and fresh water, which might call for a clean-up effort, as well as shoreline protection and clean-up.

AB  - An aerial photographic analysis of the beaches of Oahu was conducted for a period of up to 50 yr. The results indicate that the most unstable beaches are on sand bodies projecting from the coastline, such as Kualoa Point, Iroquois Point, and Paiko Peninsula. Beach changes on Oahu can be characterized by the coastline. On the north shore, intermittent erosion occurs when the beach is overwashed by waves of unusual height and force. Aerial photographs record the effects of the Dec. 1-4, 1969, storm, 1946 tsunami, and, possibly, the 1957 tsunami. Beaches facing the northeast trade wind direction are especially dynamic systems. The large, long-term changes at Kualoa, Kailua, and Lanikai beaches are caused partly by variations in sand transport along the shoreline. Erosion problems on the windward coast exist at north Kahuku Golf Course Beach, Kalanai Point, Laniloa Beach, Hauula Beach Park, Swanzy Beach Park, Kaaawa Beach Park, and Waimanalo Beach. Along much of the southern shore, waves break at the seaward edge of a shallow fringing reef. As wave energy is reduced, many of the beaches are relatively stable. Erosion during the 1967 to 1971 interval, however, occurred at Hanauma Bay, east Kahala Beach, and Paiko Peninsula. Sandy Beach, which is not protected by a fringing reef, also eroded during that period. Ewa Beach experienced erosion between 1958 and 1967. West Iroquois Point has been chronically eroding. On the leeward coast, the south end of Kahe Beach and the ends of Maili Beach have a history of persistent erosion. Most other beaches had no apparent long-term change. Nevertheless, periodic damage to the backshore area may occur from large Kona storm waves or refracted North Pacific swell. The sandy shoreline on Oahu has been classified into the following management categories: 1) hazard areas, which are subject to inundation by large winter waves; 2) chronic erosion areas, which have a long-term history that indicates that erosion will continue in the future; 3) unstable beaches, which have an alternating history of unpredictable erosion and accretion; 4) stable beaches, which have had a small net change and range in the position of the vegetation line; and 5) accreting beaches, which have grown continuously seaward. The first three categories are of the greatest concern to coastal managers.

AB  - The Ebre (Ebro) Delta is one of the most important wetland areas in the western Mediterranean. Ca. 40 % of the delta plain is less than 0.5 m above mean sea level and part of the southern margin of the delta is at mean sea level in an area protected by dikes. Both mean rates of secular subsidence in the Ebre Delta and eustatic sea level rise are ca. 1 - 2 mm/yr. Thus, the present annual relative sea level rise (RSLR) rate in the Ebre Delta may be at least 3 mm/yr. Measured accretion rates in the delta range from 4 mm/yr in the wetlands surrounding the river mouth to 99 % of the riverine sediments are retained in the reservoirs and rice fields are losing ca. 0.2 mm/yr. Future management plans should take RSLR into account and include control of freshwater and sediment flows from the river in order to offset negative effects from waterlogging and salt intrusion, and maintain land elevation. This will include the partial removal of sediments trapped behind the Ribarroja and Mequinenca dams. Stocks and inputs of sediments in the corresponding reservoirs are large enough for land elevation of ca. 50 cm in the whole delta plain. Advantages of this solution include (1) new sediments to the delta to offset subsidence (via rice fields) and coastal retreat, (2) enhanced functioning of the delta (productivity and nutrient processing), (3) avoidance of accumulation of sediments in the reservoirs. Hence, it is important to manage river discharges at the dams from an integrated viewpoint, whereas currently only hydropower and agricultural requirements are considered. It is also crucial to maintain periods of high discharge, to have enough river energy to transport as much sediments as possible.

AB  - A better definition of the long term protection strategies against littoral hazards requires evaluating investment, management, and maintenance costs of various interventions on levees and other civil engineering structures, as well as on beaches and dunes. The cost study of coastal protections (Cerema 2018) aims at providing the assessment of the project global cost. Based on the study of a large number of projects completed in France, estimations were produced to enhance the reliability of these calculations at the scale of a site in the littoral zone or of an individual natural or artificial structure. For each structure type, the obtained results are essentially linear, surface, volume or mass costs (initial costs or annual average costs), as well as lifetime and intervention frequency. To obtain this information, the analysis mainly consisted of: - the creation of a typology which crosses « structure type » and « intervention type » which allows establishing homogeneous groups of characteristic operations; - the identification, for every group, of physical parameters influencing the associated costs, which allows the user of the manual to evaluate better the difference between the observed high and low values. This paper presents the context of the study, its methodological process, the progress of the investigations and the analyses, the obtained results, and finally the generic lessons learned.

AB  - <jats:p>This paper produces an integrated concept between mangrove rehabilitation efforts and educational tourismas an innovative solution for disaster mitigation in Sei Pakning from a landscape architecture perspective. The study location is in Pangkalan Jambi, where a "Mangrove Education Center (MEC) has been established. This study aims to design integrated landscape management by considering three existing interests: ecological protection, biodiversity conservation, and economic utilization. Through the stages of inventory, analysis, synthesis, conceptualization, and tourism planning based on local resources, the three interests in the utilization of mangrove forest areas are believed to be realized. The aspect of ecological protection is carried out by setting management boundaries. Aspects of biodiversity conservation are carried out through species enrichment by mangrove nurseries and environmental education to the public. In economic utilization, technical modifications for planting mangrove zones for saline tilapia cultivation are carried out with a silvofishery pattern. Another integrated aspect is mitigating coastal disasters by making "Hybrid Engineering" or modifying the structure of a simple Wave Breaker (APO). The institutional empowerment aspect is inseparable from the design so that the level of benefit for the community can be achieved. In conclusion, the landscape design of the Pangkalan Jambi mangrove forest can be used to manage the area sustainably because it combines many interests without disturbing each other.Keywords: coastal, disaster mitigation, integrated landscape management, landscape design, mangrove</jats:p>

AB  - Wetlands play a number of roles in the water environment, principally water purification, flood control, and groundwater replenishment. In addition to these benefits, United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Ramsar Convention defined wetlands to be of biosphere significance and societal importance in the areas of shoreline stabilisation, storm protection, cultural values, recreation and tourism, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. The function of most natural wetland systems is not to treat wastewater, however, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental scientists who specialize in the area of wastewater treatment. In the past wetlands used to be in place naturally and used to provide ecological benefits to the mankind and environment. Through recognizing their immense benefits, human being started to construct artificial wetlands. Recently, constructed wetlands are recommended as one of the salient features of water sensitive urban design, which play an important role in water management and ecologically sustainable development. These constructed artificial wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to help in treating wastewater effluent. Artificial wetlands provide the ability to experiment with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and flora in order to produce the most efficient treatment process. Constructed wetlands are increasingly being designed and used to treat wastewaters. Majority of constructed wetlands are designed based on steady-state releases of pollutants loading. However, in some cases (i.e. aquaculture ponds) pollutant loadings are not steady-state, rather are intermittent. Pollutants transport analysis based on steady-state release (inflow) will be quite different from an analysis based on intermittent loading/inflow. In the past several studies were conducted on pollutants transport and degradation through wetlands using steady-state inflow of pollutants. In this paper, a simple numerical model is proposed and developed based on conservation of mass principle for the pollutants and transport through a wetland, considering a series of tanks. Tank-in-series approach assumes that the wetland is comprised of several interconnected tanks, each of which can be modeled as a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. As for pollutants, in this study organic matters are considered. Same numerical model can be used for different organic matters, considering different values of degradation rate. Using first-order kinetic equations of pollutants transport and degradation and applying Euler's method of difference equations a numerical model was developed. Developed numerical model can simulate pollutant transport and degradations for steady-state, continuous and/or irregular/intermittent pollutant loadings. Numerical model results were verified with earlier developed analytical solutions for intermittent pollutant loadings, which were applied for aquaculture ponds in Texas (USA). Numerical model results are close to the results derived from analytical solutions for the same condition. Reasons of some primary discrepancies are discussed. Developed numerical model was used to present different scenario using different flow rates, pond volumes and different masses of intermittent pollutants. It is found that all of these parameters have significant impact on outflow pollutants' concentrations. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.

AB  - Much of Australian railway tracks traverse coastal areas containing soft soils and marine deposits. Pre-construction stabilization of soft formation soils by applying a surcharge load alone often takes too long. The installation of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) can reduce the preloading period significantly by decreasing the drainage path length, sometimes by a factor of 10 or more. The analytical solution based on actual radial soil permeability is proposed considering the variation of vacuum pressure, and the Cavity Expansion Theory is employed to predict the smear zone caused by the installation of mandrel driven vertical drains. The predicted smear zone and the effect of drain unsaturation are compared with data obtained from a large-scale radial consolidation tests and the results are explained. When a higher load is required to meet the desired rate of settlement and the cost of surcharge is also significant, the application of vacuum pressure with reduced surcharge loading can be used. In this method, an external negative load is applied to the soil surface in the form of vacuum pressure through a sealed membrane system. The applied vacuum pressure generates negative pore water pressure, resulting in an increase in effective stress and accelerated consolidation, also avoiding the need for a high surcharge embankment. The analytical and numerical analyses incorporating the authors' equivalent plane strain solution for both Darcian and non-Dracian flow are conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements and several selected case histories are analysed and presented. Cyclic loading of PVDs is also examined in the laboratory in a manner appropriate for railway environments. It is shown that short PVDs can dissipate excess pore pressure as fast as they are built up under repeated loading conditions. The research findings verify that the impact of smear and vacuum pressure can significantly affect soil consolidation, and these aspects need to be simulated properly in the selected numerical approach. Finally, the use of native vegetation to stabilise soft soils in railway environment is discussed with the aid of preliminary suction models developed on the basis of evapotranspiration mechanics applied to tree roots. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study clarified the centennial-scale changes in meiobenthic bay ostracod assemblages in Japan over the past approximately 3000 years with relation to various human-induced and natural environmental factors. These factors were inferred via integrated multiproxy methods of high-resolution geological analyses of core sediments obtained from a shallow bay off a coastal plain, along with literature surveys of archeological and historical records. Five intervals were defined based on multivariate analyses of ostracod assemblages. The ostracod assemblage was stable before around the 6th century because of aggradational sedimentation related to gradual increases in sea level. Since then, the composite factors such as the development of a sandy spit near the study site, stable sea level, regional tectonics, regional centennial-scale climatic change possibly related to El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and flood mitigation by human settlement in the coastal plains triggered the formation of tidal flats and subtidal sandy areas with seagrass beds. This has markedly influenced offshore bay ostracod assemblages since around the 12th century. Anthropogenic impacts, such as reclamation and various artificial constructions since the late 20th century caused the disappearance of seagrass beds, input of coarser sediment into offshore bays, and increased nutrient loads. Therefore, ostracod assemblages have changed drastically. Ostracod assemblages near the boundary between land and sea have been affected by multiple complex factors, such as regional climate and depositional and human-induced processes during the Late Holocene.

AB  - Bangladesh through its complex network of river systems drains an area of about 1.76 million sq. km of the catchment of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna of which only 7.5 percent lies in Bangladesh. The Sundarbans is situated in the Ganges catchment area which known as the single largest mangrove forest and a unique ecosystems in the world. It is representing 3.5 percent of the world mangrove and consisting of an area 6017 sq.km. It is a natural shield that protects the coastal area from storm surges and cyclones in pre and post monsoon periods. Since the diversion of Ganges water at Farakka Barrage in India from early 1975, capillary upward movement of soluble salts due to presence flows while the industries are facing serious problems in quality control of the products and disastrous effects on agriculture, fisheries, navigation, hydromorphology, drinking water, wetlands and mangrove ecosystems. Chemical factors like salinity, pH, oxidation reduction, potential mineral contents, marine pollution, sedimentation etc are the major ones which influence the development of management forest. Consequently both siltation and salinity have increased in the Sundarbans region. The dominant Sundari (Heritiera fomes) are affected by top-dying disease which is recognised as key management concern. The Ganges water sharing is not just a geo-techno-political problem it is also a human problem. Interaction is needed between states where it is a common concern. The objectives of this paper is to contribute to formulate a long-term management plan for mangrove wetlands resources through ensure to supply Ganges water into Sundarbans. GIS simulation and modelling would be a proper tools for decision making and make recommendations for the protection of Sundarbans ecosystems. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Within the past 100 years, 25 hurricanes have struck the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Apalachicola, Florida. During the passage of the storms, marginal coastal lowlands were often flooded, passes from coastal estuaries to the sea were heavily eroded, and the size and position of offshore barrier islands suffered significant modification. Not generally observed, however, were changes that took place in the submarine environment. These changes, from a geological standpoint, were equally impressive. Investigations have now confirmed that the passage of Hurricane Elena near Apalachicola Bay, Florida, in 1985, caused severe scouring of the bottom of the bay and also the resuspension and removal of over 80 million tons of sediment from the bay in a period of some 8 to 10 hours. Mobile Bay, similarly, was impacted by Hurricane Frederic, in 1979. The passage of this storm caused an overall deepening of the day of approximately 1.5 feet and the removal of nearly 290 million tons of sediment in a period of 7 hours. This is especially striking when it is realized that this amount of sediment is nearly equivalent to that delivered by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico during one entire year!

AB  - The most important problems with a negative impact for Romanian coast, the erosion phenomen, are given by the numerous conflicts between the development of various economic activities and it is necessary to implement a system for preventing the further deterioration of shoreline. Coastal protection systems can be represented by linear structures perpendicular to the shore, called groynes. The groynes trapping sand on the upstream side and in this way, protect the coast behind the sand filet. The protection depends on the stability of this sand filet under extreme conditions. Groynes can have special shapes and depends the type of protection which is necessary. In this paper we propose to analyze the influence of groynes on the shoreline, including the sediment transport, taking into account the type of coastal zone. We will see the coastal profile, the distribution of the littoral drift in the coastal profile and the evolution of the shore according to different sizes of groynes over a set time period. The erosion problem will be solved only on the upstream side of the groyne for a length and depends on the length of the groyne for the given wave climate. © SGEM2017. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The River Taf forms a small macrotidal estuary impounded by a coastal barrier and opening into a shallow Carmarthen Bay (southwest Wales). Periodic estimates of the sand budget over a ten-year period show that sand is accumulating in the estuary at a mean vertical rate of 0.13 m or more per year. The rise of sand level is two orders of magnitude greater than the present-day rise of sea level. Abundant textural and some mineralogical evidence proves this sand to be of marine origin. The rate of accumulation is related to the frequency of westerly waves which move sand landwards from Carmrthen Bay. This sand is distinctive in its uniformity of texture but multiplicity of sedimentary structures. Neither the mean grain size nor the majority of structures reflect the high energy of the environment. Although the direction of net transport is landwards, most of the small-scale structures face seawards. The tide within the estuary is markedly asymmetrical, the flood being shorter than the ebb. Because sand is infilling the estuary, a spring tide must rise up to 2 m from low water mark before it can enter, and this takes several hours, by which time the flood is well advanced in the bay. Fast flood currents (up to 1.8 m/s), amplified at the constricted estuary mouth, are generated as the tide pours in. Fast ebb currents also develop, particularly when river flow is high, as shoals become exposed and water is confined to the main channels. Circulation varies from moderately stratified to well-mixed. Hence storm waves from the Atlantic are pushing sand into the estuary from Carmarthen Bay, and the accumulating sand in turn dictates the unusual estuarine dynamics. © 1980.

AB  - Extensive Salicornia beds along the Gulf of Kutchchh (northwest) and Tamilnadu (southeast) coasts were investigated with respect to vegetative structure and ambient environmental conditions. The width of the beds varied from approximately 5 in to 1000 in, depending upon the topography and tidal influence. The most extensive and healthy stands occurred in the regularly (20-50 tides month(-1)) inundated intertidal zones. The width of Salicornia beds in the Gulf of Kutchchh was greater than those along the Tamilnadu coast due to greater (0.83-7.2 in) tidal amplitude and flat topography. The sediments from beds of the Gulf of Kutchchh were rich (4.9-16.9% dry weight) in organic matter. The salt content in the sediments from Tamilnadu was relatively very low (0.08-0.1% dry weight) compared to sediments from the Gulf of Kutchchh (0.48-0.78% dry weight). Plant biomass, density, height, and frequency of occurrence in the more frequently inundated regions were greater than in the poorly or less frequently inundated intertidal regions. The average total biomass varied from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) and was mostly comprised of aboveground components. Peak biomass values of Salicornia were observed during September to February in the Gulf of Kutchchh, while along the southeast coast, they were observed during December to March. The growth of the S. brachiata seemed to be influenced primarily by the frequency of inundation, duration of atmospheric exposure at ebb tide, rainfall, and salinity and salt content of the ambient water and sediments, respectively. Average carbon and nitrogen content in the plants were estimated to be 21.7 +/- 1.9% and 0.8 +/- 0.17% (dry weight), respectively. The carbon content increased with increasing age of the plant, while protein content decreased. Constantly increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal wetlands warrant immediate protection of S. brachiata and other obligate halophytes, which are either threatened/vulnerable or endangered.

AB  - A small but diverse assemblage of pollen and spores recovered from marine sediments of the Avon Park Formation (middle Eocene) in west central Florida, represents the oldest land flora described from the state. Twenty‐one pollen taxa from terrestrial plants, are identified from the Dolime Minerals and Gulf Hammock quarries. The presence of mangrove pollen associates such as Acrostichum, Nypa, and Pelliciera associated with seagrass macrofossils, combined with evidence from invertebrate fossils and sedimentary structures, suggest that the sediments of the Avon Park Formation, at these quarry sites, were deposited in a shallow marine lagoon, perhaps near the mouth of a river or stream in a protected area that had some tidal influence. This is the earliest report of terrestrial vegetation and near marine vegetation of Florida and documents the presence of a Florida landmass during middle Eocene time.

AB  - Earthen levees protecting coastal regions can be exposed to compound flooding induced by multiple drivers such as coastal water level, river discharge, and precipitation. However, the majority of flood hazard analyses consider only one flood driver at a time. This study numerically investigates the performance of an earthen levee in Sherman Island, Sacramento, CA, under compound flooding induced by fluvial and pluvial flooding. A finite element model is built for fully coupled 3D stress-flow simulations of the levee. The finite element model is then used to simulate the hydro-mechanical response of the levee under different flood scenarios. Fluvial flood hydrographs for different scenarios are obtained using a bivariate extreme analysis of peak river discharge and peak ocean level while accounting for the significance of correlation between these two variables. Pluvial flooding is characterized using intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves of extreme precipitations for the study area. The fluvial and pluvial flood patterns for different recurrence intervals are used in the finite element model to simulate the hydro-mechanical response of the levee. Results show that considering compound flooding leads to 8.7% and 18.6% reduction in the factor of safety for 2 and 50-year recurrence intervals, respectively.

AB  - In connection with hydraulic studies of a new coastal resort development on the south-east coast of Bali in Indonesia, a three-dimensional (30) physical model study was carried out. The study was aimed at the determination of the wave transformation over a shallow natural reef in front of the resort and for the design of the nibble mound revetments to be built for coastal protection. Due to the heavy wave breaking on the reef, physical model tests were the only viable avenue for obtaining a reliable design of the revetment structures located behind the shallow reef area. The stability of the armour layer as well as the overtopping of the revetments were equally important aspects of this part of the study, since not only should the resort be protected against storm waves, but visitors should also be able to comfortably visit the coastal areas during more normal wave conditions. This paper mainly concerns the wave dynamics on the reef Due to the limited water depth the wave conditions were dominated by heavy wave breaking and the associated release of the bound long-period wave components in the LL ave groups of the incident wave train. These long-period wave components caused a dynamic water level set-up with long-period variations in front of the revetments (surf beats). The depth-limited wave conditions on the reef and the dynamic water level set-lip had major influence on the evolution of damage and overtopping of the revetments and made the design of the revetments particularly complex.

AB  - Abstract. Ljubljana marsh in Slovenia is a 16 000 ha area of partly drained fen, intended to be flooded to restore its ecological functions. The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (~30 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization (CO2 and CH4 production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding (>5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period of 84 d at 15°C and a minimum of 7 d at 37°C, the optimum temperature for methanogenesis. This lag was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H2 and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14–38°C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91%) mcrA (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found. Our results suggest that methane emission can remain transient and low if water-table fluctuations allow re-oxidation of ferrous iron, sustaining iron reduction as the most important process in terminal carbon mineralization.

AB  - Biochar substrates and tidal flow (TF) and intermittent aeration (IA) operation modes have recently been applied to improve the treatment performance of constructed wetlands (CWs), but their roles in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from CWs are still unclear. In this preliminary study, CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes and associated microbial characteristics in four groups of subsurface-flow CWs, i.e., ceramsite CWs (C-CWs), biochar-amended CWs (B-CWs), intermittently aerated B-CWs (AB-CWs) and tide-flow B-CWs (TB-CWs), were comparatively investigated. The results showed that biochar amendment significantly mitigated CH4 and N2O fluxes from the CWs by supporting higher abundances of mcrA and nosZ genes and higher ratios of pmoA/mcrA and nosZ/(nirK + nirS), thus reducing global warming potential (GWP, a decrease of 55.8%), in addition to promoting total nitrogen (TN) removal by 41.3%, mainly by increasing the abundances and activities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The TF mode efficiently improved nitrogen removal, but it greatly increased GHG fluxes since large amounts of GHGs escaped from the empty CW matrix after water draining. IA abated GHG emissions from the CWs, mainly after aeration. TF and IA decreased the abundances of functional bacteria and archaea related to C and N transformation, except nitrifiers, and shaped the microbial community structures. The application of a biochar substrate and IA mode can facilitate the design and operation of CWs in a more ecologically sustainable way. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the global mean sea level rising, coastal regions will be flooded by causing substantial domestic gross losses. In tropical and subtropical regions, coral reefs exist along coastlines around the world. Most of the energy in the waves would be eliminated by coming across the coastal barrier. The extended lagoons and steep flanks of most fringing reefs produce unique surf zone processes and they are the natural ports for the fishmen and the boats with small draft. Using this analytical solution, the global characteristics of the wave propagating over submerged plate barrier considering the geometric and the incident wave parameters are analyzed with great efforts. It shows that the width of the plate barrier and the depth of the shallow water play important roles to eliminate the incident wave. The wave parameters are changed remarkably over the submerged plate barrier besides the wave period or frequency. The wave transmission coefficients are also obtained by contrasting the amplitudes of the incident wave and the diffracted one without breaking. However, the wave breaking plays more significant role to eliminate the incident wave than the submerged barrier. The role of the submerged barrier is mostly under-estimated for reflecting and dissipating incident wave because the wave breaking and the turbulent would dissipate the wave energy. The wave breaking and the turbulent which are not included in this potential fluid model and they should be investigated in detail in the future.

AB  - (1) Simulations of wave action and erosion, using a wave-producing device and a recirculating flume, were established on the Haigang mudflat, in the Yellow River estuary, China, along with the geotechnical-parameter tests of the water content, bulk density, undrained shear strength, penetration strength, and grain-size distribution. Moreover, the variety of seabed morphological characteristics under different wave actions was also observed in field. The experimental results showed that the erodibility of the silty sediment was significantly affected by the cyclic wave loading in Yellow River estuary. The erodibility varied with the changing wave loading and was closely related to the liquefaction and topography characteristics of the surficial sediment, which restricted the physical and mechanical properties of the sediment. Additionally, the wave loading transformed the sediment components and the size grading, which also had a remarkable effect on the erodibility. Increasing the length of the time vibration during wave loading clearly reduced erosion resistivity, although fluctuations appeared in the overall downward trend, consistent with the strength indexes of the silty sediment. The other geotechnical parameters, size grading, and sediment components show the wave's dynamic variation with the changing conditions, but no clear internal relationship could be found between the varying physical parameters and the variation in erosion during the changing conditions of the wave during the experiments.

AB  - California has initiated a new approach to create an objective standard and regulate best achievable protection (BAP) for sensitive shoreline protection from vessel spills. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) and California's Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act (SB 2040) mandate BAP as the standard for preparedness and response. BAP poses the critical response planning questions: "How much response resources should industry provide?" and "In what time frames should those resources be deployed?" Prior California regulations intended to achieve BAP by relying on vessels to identify hazards, trajectories, environmental consequences, and response resource plans, produced less than optimal results in many instances. Though effective in theory, this approach resulted in fuzzy consequences and vague arrangements for adequate response. Because it was neither clear what sites would be protected (and what response resources would be required) nor at what time, and because it was consequentially not clear what response resources would be engaged to execute protection, drilling C-plans became obtuse. This in turn fostered "paper tiger " OSROs and resulted in an uneven playing field for business competitors. In California's new approach, OSPR used many of the original concepts to identify BAP by using the NOAA GNOME oil spill model for generic vessel risk threats for California ports and along the California coast. This paper explains the theory, steps, and details. As a result of this process, BAP has been defined in terms of specific site deployments at specific time intervals and presented in tables in regulation. This new approach provides a number of benefits and solutions to the difficult issues in the former approach, including a standard for BAP.

AB  - Distribution and habitat use are presented on the 50 most abundant fish species captured in shallow nearshore waters (<20 m offshore and < 5 m) deep relative to mean lower low water (MLLW) of southeastern Alaska. Fish were captured with a beach seine at 41 locations from 1998 to 2004. At each location, habitats sampled included sand or gravel beaches with no attached vegetation, cobble beaches with understory kelps (e.g., Laminaria saccharina), soft bottom (sand, silt, or mud) beaches with eelgrass (Zostera marina), and steep bedrock outcrops. A total of 538 seince hauls yielded 449,166 fish. Based on total catch, the three most abundant species were walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). Mean catch per seine haul was greatest in eelgrass for 30 of the 50 most abundant species. Juveniles dominated the catch of all species captured. For example, mean size of walleye pollock, Pacific sand lance, and Pacific herring was less than 100 mm fork length. Distribution patterns were evident for many fish species; some are widely distributed throughout southeastern Alaska (crescent gunnel, Pholis laeta), whereas others are confined to southern waters (kelp perch, Brachyistius frenatus) or more outside coastal waters (black rockfish, Sebastes melanops). Shallow nearshore waters support a diverse and abundant community of fishes, many of commercial importance. Information on distribution and habitat of nearshore fish assemblages will help resource managers identify and protect coastal areas at risk to human disturbance.

AB  - In modelling the transport of phosphorus (P), soil erosion during stormflow events and associated transport of particulates in the hydrological network are usually assumed to be the major processes involved in export from non-point-sources. This simplifying assumption is adopted in the light of the strong affinity of P for the soil solid phase and the high particulate P concentrations generally measured downstream of various agricultural catchments. Recent studies centred on the Lake Geneva catchment show that there is a considerable spatial and temporal variability of P species exported in surface runoff associated with storm-flow events. This variability in P export results from interactions between different types of flow, whose structural and soil moisture conditions (globally driven by seasonal trends) mainly control the water flow pathway on the catchment, and a set of P stocks of variable mobilities and availabilities that are distributed according to land use and topography. P losses from soils do not necessarily imply export at the outlet of the catchment basin, since intervening buffer zones (e.g. field margins, meadows, marshlands, etc.) modify the transfer of P. These buffer zones are capable of storing permanently or temporarily a portion of the transferred P and restoring it at least partially during subsequent storm-flow events, sometimes with transformation of the P species. The hydrographic network (particularly that part associated with sediments and banks) acts sometimes as a sink and sometimes as a source of P. All these compartments modify the quantities exported at the outlet, their speciation, and the timing of export. On this basis, we propose a conceptual model of the transfer of P in small catchments, integrating the role of morpho-pedological pattern and other characteristics of the landscape. For each storm-flow event, the model defines a hydrochemical pattern of outlet P losses, allowing an annual cycle of P emission to be defined, along with the corresponding dominant species of P, and the potential impact on lake waters. This kind of model throws into relief the various scales and components needed for control water quality at the respective scales of agricultural plots, inter-field structures and hydrographic networks, as well as the different human actors involved.

AB  - The behavior of Oregon Inlet, located north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on the Pamlico Sound estuary, and its commercial, ecological, and recreational importance have been the subject of much study and controversy. The construction of a terminal groin on the southern shoulder of the inlet in 1990 served to heighten this interest. Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the NC Department of Transportation (NCDOT) have maintained monitoring programs since that time to study the impact of the terminal groin on the morphology of the inlet and the adjacent shorelines. This paper utilizes data from the USACE and NCDOT programs to examine the relationship between the growth of the Bodie Island spit and the resulting bathymetric changes in the inlet. Data collected are compared with results from the literature. The morphology of Oregon Inlet exhibited changes expected with the stabilization of a single shoulder of a tidal inlet. In contrast, the cross-sectional area of the channel at the minimum inlet width changed little. When analyzed in light of empirical equilibrium conditions reported in the literature, the results supported the conclusion that the inlet had achieved a new equilibrium configuration due to the presence of the terminal groin.

AB  - The Quaternary deposits of the Hanoi area have been investigated in order to provide information required for the design of a groundwater-flow model. Limited sedimentological data exist from 32 destructive drillings carried out previously in the study area. The data base contains hydrographical and hydrogeological observations, but few sedimentological details. This is in contrast with the more seaward regions of the area where the Holocene deposits of the Red River plain has previously been studied. However, a comparison of the results obtained in this study with the previous studies indicates that the Hanoi sediment succession developed in an incised valley under conditions of rapid relative sea-level rise until ca. 7-6 a cal BR The succession consists initially of alluvial floodplain deposits conformably overlain by mud deposited at the head of an estuary which filled with continuing rapid sea-level rise. Once the relative sea-level rise stabilized, fluvial deposition prograded over the adjacent estuarine mud. The development of a groundwater-flow model requires knowledge of the three-dimensional distribution of the various deposits. Despite the paucity of information with respect to sediment description, a model of the entire Quaternary sequence is presented in several lithostratigraphic cross-sections and a panel diagram. The latter forms the basis for the construction of a contour map of the base of the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and for a sequence map of the Quaternary deposits in the study area.

AB  - In this study the use of a hybrid shoreline model, namely the Mike21FM Shoreline Model, has been applied to investigate the effectiveness of three different coastal protection schemes for Palm Beach in Southern Queensland, Australia. The yearly littoral drift on this shoreline is approximately 500,000 m3 to the north. The three coastal protection schemes are: Nourishment, Nourishment plus a submerged control structure and Nourishment plus artificial headlands. The coastal impact due to the three schemes is quantified and compared using the shoreline model. The results assisted the Gold Coast City Council in their decision on which option to bring forward to the detailed design phase.

AB  - Tidal dissipation is a major heat source for the icy satellites of the giant planets. Several icy satellites likely possess a subsurface ocean underneath an ice shell. Previous studies of tidal dissipation on icy satellites, however, have either assumed a static ocean or ignored the effect of the ice lid on subsurface ocean dynamics. In this study, we examine inertial effects on tidal deformation of satellites with a dynamic ocean overlain by an ice lid based on viscoelasto-gravitational theory. Although ocean dynamics is treated in a simplified fashion, we find a resonant configuration when the phase velocity of ocean gravity waves is similar to that of the tidal bulge. This condition is achieved when a subsurface ocean is thin (<1 km). The enhanced deformation (increased h sub(2) and k sub(2) Love numbers) near the resonant configuration would lead to enhanced tidal heating in the solid lid. A static ocean formulation gives an accurate result only if the ocean thickness is much larger than the resonant thickness. The resonant configuration strongly depends on the properties of the shell, demonstrating the importance of the presence of a shell on tidal dissipation. Key Points * We examine inertial effects on tidal deformation of icy satellites with a solid lid * A resonance occurs when a subsurface ocean is thin * The resonant configuration strongly depends on the properties of the icy shell

AB  - In accordance with the current Russian normative documents, determining wave loads and impacts on hydraulic structures should be calibrated by field measurements and laboratory studies. However, it is problematic to satisfy this norm, because there are no measured wave parameters for the main coastal areas. Moreover, the equivalent virtually designed waves cannot be compared directly with the measured real ones. The situation may be improved by the method of reanalyzing meteorological conditions for the region within 30-50 years and then modeling dangerous storms. The method of reanalysis has been applied for the coastal zone in Imeretinskaya Lowland in Sochi to develop the coastal protection structures. The calculated waves have been compared to the existing buoy measurement (Gelendzhik) and coastal wave station's measurement (Sochi). It is advisable to take field measurement of waves with near-bottom pressure gauges. They are acceptable for complicated conditions. Surface waves are calculated by wave theory.

AB  - The number of marine species at risk of extinction is rising. Understanding the threats that contribute to extinction risk in the seas is thus critical to conservation. When major threats to marine, estuarine, and diadromous species on the US Endangered Species Act and IUCN Red lists were ranked according to the number of species they affect, strong consensus in the ranking of threats across species and between institutions emerged. Overexploitation is the most frequent threat to vulnerable marine species, with approximately half of threatened species caught as bycatch in fisheries. Habitat degradation, the primary threat to terrestrial species, ranks second in impact on marine species. Loss of listed marine species would probably affect ecosystem function and delivery of ecosystem services because many of these species are strong interactors, including ecosystem engineers, taxa that provide important nutrient links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and a disproportionate number of high trophic-level predators.

AB  - Introduction: This study focuses on the policy response of six study states—California, Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington—to restore or protect four critical and threatened habitats: oyster reefs or beds, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses. These coastal ecosystems, which exist in salt, fresh, and brackish waters along coastlines, provide structurally complex nurseries, shelters, and habitats for a myriad of commercially and culturally significant aquatic species, and other important ecosystem services (Barbier 2013). The study examined the selected six states to capture the diversity of geography, restoration and protection policies, and sources of environmental degradation across the country. The study examined the four coastal habitats because of their historic and current extent along the coastal United States, economic and cultural relevance, and importance in maintaining key ecosystem services including food provision, recreation, coastal resilience, and more.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a study of the use of bioengineered erosion control structures on Alaskan streams and rivers. Field investigations of hydraulic and vegetation conditions at 11 study sites around the state of Alaska were conducted to determine the performance of these structures. Root wads, live staking, brush layering, and coir logs were the primary bioengineering methods used for erosion control at the study sites. A one-dimensional numerical computer model was applied at each site to estimate the magnitude of average bed and bank shear stresses (tractive force) apparent to the erosion control structures at the 50- and 100-year design flood levels. Discharge records and field flood indicators were checked to correlate structure condition to flow history. Damage at existing structures was attributed to flowing ice, undermining of toe protection, buoyancy effects, and failure of construction fabrics. Root wad structures in good condition were located in areas with high boat wake occurrence but low channel tractive forces. The findings of the study suggest that the types of bioengineered erosion control structures studied have not been proven to offer reliable bank erosion protection during flooding conditions on channels with high tractive forces.

AB  - Neighborhood pond associations have proven to be an especially effective force in the protection and enhancement of local coastal ecosystems. Environmental managers who are wise enough to forge partnerships with these local organizations will be rewarded with the energy, commitment, and passion reserved for issues that hit close to home. With the vigilance and dedication of a Neighborhood Crime Watch, local pond associations are the eyes and ears that sound the first alerts of environmental pollution. With the efficiency of local Minutemen, they rally to the cause as volunteer environmental advocates who offer financial commitment, a wealth of expertise, and effective political organization. The environmental accomplishments of neighborhood groups on Martha's Vineyard are impressive. The Edgartown Harbor Association funded a water quality study resulting in the establishment of a free sewage pump-out facility for boaters. The Friends of Sengekontacket (Pond) provided the leadership to coordinate a local, state, and federal partnership to complete a major dredging project that restored filled shellfish habitat and nourished an eroding barrier beach. The Lagoon Pond Association funded a court battle to limit pier construction. The Tisbury Great Pond Think Tank and Tisbury Waterways, Inc. have addressed farm and roadway runoff with fencing, buffer strips, and innovative catch basins. All have conducted successful public education programs, water quality monitoring studies, and fundraising activities designed to protect shellfish habitats and water quality. Many have advanced protective zoning initiatives.

AB  - The existing knowledge on the sources, distribution, and composition of marine debris worldwide and its impact on marine wildlife as well as the economy, were reviewed by bringing together most of the relevant literature published so far. Marine debris (or marine litter), defined as any manufactured or processed solid material that enters the marine environment, is a greatly underestimated component of marine pollution. Although there are various types of litter, plastics (synthetic organic polymers) make up most of the marine debris worldwide. The important properties (light, strong, resistant to degradation, and low-cost) that make plastics so widely used are also the reasons why plastics are a serious hazard to the marine environment, where they gradually accumulate and may persist for decades. Most marine debris originates from land-based activities, and the main sources include storm water discharges, municipal landfills located near the coast, riverine transport of waste from landfills and other sources, discharges of untreated municipal sewage, the plastic industry and other industrial facilities, unregulated disposal of litter due to absence of waste services or landfills, tourism, all types of vessels, offshore oil and gas platforms, and aquaculture installations. Litter may concentrate on the seafloor and reaches very high densities, especially in coastal areas but also in some accumulation zones in the open sea. Densities that reach many thousands or even millions of items per hectare have been reported on the seafloor or along beaches. Marine debris is a serious threat to marine life and may negatively affect the populations of many species. The entanglement of marine species, especially marine mammals, seabirds, turtles, fish, and crustaceans has been frequently described as a serious mortality factor. Marine species may ingest debris items (mostly plastics), presumably mistaking them for prey, which has many harmful effects on their physical condition and survival. Toxic contaminants like PCBs may enter marine food chains through ingested plastics with potentially very negative effects. Drift debris can increase the distribution range of certain marine organisms and assist in the invasion of alien species, which is a primary threat to global biodiversity. High marine litter densities have a potential effect on the structure of benthic communities by altering the characteristics of the local biotope, and may act as the means for the invasion of many hard-substratum species that could displace indigenous fauna due to competition or predation. Marine debris, especially derelict fishing gear, causes substantial damage to coral reefs and coral facies. Marine debris has a considerable economic impact, mainly due to lost tourism, reduction of commercial fish and crustaceans stocks due to ghost fishing, the time and expense of rescue operations for entangled or damaged vessels, costs of clean ups of beaches and coral or rocky reefs, and increased conservation costs of endangered marine species. The effect of marine debris on both marine fauna and the human economy is expected to become a more prominent issue in the future as marine debris concentration in the marine environment continuously increases. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Japan has been constructing long coastal defense since the storm surge disaster with a loss of 5,000 lives by Typhoon Vera in 1959. The defense is designed for the storm water level including the storm surge of the standard typhoon based on Typhoon Vera. Stochastic typhoon model, simulating various typhoon track and intensity with Monte Carlo method, is one of useful tools to estimate the return period. According to recent research output the return period of the storm surge of the standard typhoon is near 100 years or more at three major bays in Japan. But there is uncer-tainty by some of parameters and models in the stochastic simulation. Sea surface drag coefficient under high wind speed and future change in typhoon intensity and track are critical to extreme values of the storm surges.

AB  - Following the Painted Cave Fire of 25 June 1990 in Santa Barbara, California which burned 1214 ha, an emergency watershed protection plan was implemented consisting of stream clearing, grade stabilizers and construction of debris basins. Research was initiated focusing on hydrological response and channel morphology changes on two branches of Maria Ygnacio Creek, the main drainage of the burned area. Research results support the hypothesis that the response of small drainage basins in chaparral ecosystems to wildfire is complex and flushing of sediment by fluvial processes is more likely than by high magnitude debris flows. During the winter of 1990-1991, 35-66 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 10 cm per hour for a five-minute period were recorded with a seasonal total of 100% of average (normal) rainfall (average = 63 cm/year). During the winter of 1991-1992, 48-74 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 8 cm per hour were recorded with a seasonal total of 115% of normal. Even though there was moderate rainfall on barren, saturated soils, no major debris flows occurred in burned areas. The winter of 1992-1993 recorded total precipitation of about 170% of normal, annual average intensities were relatively low and again no debris flows were observed. The response to winter storms in the first three years following the fire was a moderate but spectacular flushing of sediment, most of which was derived from the hillslopes upstream of the debris basins. The first significant storm and stream flow of the 1990-1991 winter was transport-limited resulting in large volumes of sediment being deposited in the channel of Maria Ygnacio Creek; the second storm and stream flow was sediment-limited and the channel scoured. Debris basins trapped about 23000 m3, the majority coming from the storm of 17-20 March 1991. Sediment transported downstream during the three winters following the fire and not trapped in the debris basins was eventually flushed to the estuarine reaches of the creeks below the burn area, where approximately 108000 m3 accumulated. Changes in stream morphology following the fire were dramatic as pools filled with sediment which greatly smoothed longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. Major changes in channel morphology occur following a fire as sediment derived from the hillslope is temporarily stored in channels within the burned area. However, this sediment may quickly move downstream of the burned region, where it may accumulate reducing channel capacity and increasing the flood hazard. Ecological consequences of wildfire to the riparian zone of streams in the chaparral environment are virtually unknown, but must be significant as the majority of sediment (particularly gravel necessary for fish and other aquatic organisms) entering the system does so in response to fires. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Based on present rates of accelerating land loss, restoration of coastal wetlands in Louisiana will be compromised if offshore exploration does not locate sufficient compatible sand and suitable sediment for restoration of coastal Louisiana in general and barrier islands in particular. Presently, exploration for sand and mixed sediments is guided by project-specific protocols. Better planning and management of multiple-user-conflicts requires regional understanding of sediment resources that would result in a more beneficial approach. Regional sediment management, which helps protect, preserve, and properly distribute sand and mixed sedimentary deposits, would best be achieved by inter-agency coordination so that identified sediment resources would not be subsequently traversed by oil and gas pipelines or infrastructure. Integration of sediment management plans are needed because sediment budgets are not independent systems. Instead of looking at project specific needs, it is posited that a programmatic approach be adopted to effectively manage the demand for large sediment volumes needed to restore sustainability in the Louisiana coastal zone.

AB  - Khalil, S. M.; Finkl, C. W., and Raynie, R. C., 2013. Development of new rRestoration strategies for Louisiana barrier island systems, northern Gulf of Mexico, USA The rapid degradation of Louisiana's barrier island (BI) systems adversely impacts the vitality of strategic economic and biological resources (including aquatic habitat). Louisiana's BI systems have undergone landward migration through BI rollover, area loss and island narrowing as a result of complex interactions among land subsidence, sea-level rise, wave processes, inadequate sediment supply, and intense human disturbance. Consequently, the structural continuity of the BI shorelines has weakened as the islands narrowed, fragmented and, in some cases, submerged. Several multipronged restoration strategies are currently underway to develop effective interdisciplinary restoration projects that mitigate degradation of the Mississippi River delta plain and compensate for coastal land loss. Restoration of the BI systems requires strategies that protect interior wetlands and bolster the first lines of storm defense in a post- Hurricane Katrina-Rita-Gustav-Ike-Isaac and post-Deep Water Horizon era. Coastline degradation would have continued were it not for a series of massive barrier island restoration projects. Such efforts commonly consist of beach nourishment on the Gulfside and marsh creation on the bayside of barrier islands. Regionalizing monitoring, maintenance, and data management efforts support the still evolving scientific and engineering aspects of rebuilding BIs.

AB  - Long-term variation of mean sea level has been considered the primary exogenous factor of vegetation dynamics in salt marshes. In this study, we address the importance of short-term, wind-induced rise of the sea surface in such biogeographic changes. There was an unusual opportunity for examining field data on plant species frequency, sea-level variation, and sedimentation acquired from the Skallingen salt marsh in Denmark since the 1930s. The environmental and floristic history of Skallingen was summarized as (1) continuous sea-level rise with temporal variability (2.3-5.0 mm yr-1), (2) continuous sedimentation with spatial variability (2.0-4.0 mm yr-1), (3) increased frequency of over-marsh flooding events, and (4) contemporary dominance of Halimione portulacoides, indicating little progressive succession toward a later phase. Conventionally, recent eustatic sea-level rise was believed to drive the increased frequency of flooding and such retarded succession. Skallingen, however, has showed more or less equilibrated yearly rates between sea-level rise and surface accretion. This implies that the long-term, gradual sea-level rise alone might not be enough to explain the increased inundation frequency across the marsh. Here, we suggest an alternative chain: Recent trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation index toward its positive phase have led to increased storminess and wind tides on the ocean surface, resulting in increased frequency, duration, and depth of submergence, and hence, waterlogging of marsh soils, which has retarded ecological succession. To conclude, we stress the need for a multitemporal perspective that recognizes the significance of short-term sea-level fluctuations nested within long-term trends.

AB  - The deltas at Nakdong Estuary may experience environmental impact because of the construction of Busan New Port. There are several physical properties which can influence the bathymetrie change at the area. The effect of the New Port on the future bathymetrie changes of the deltas was examined in three main directions: the tidal current, wave and wave-induced current, and river flood. This paper describes the tidal current environment and the consequent bathymetrie change before and after the construction of the Busan New Port and the Nakdong Tidal Barrage. The model results show that the new port will reduce the tidal current speed around the construction site, but not significantly influence the flows around the river mouth area.

AB  - Korea has achieved both economical and socio-cultural developments in recent years, and in the midst of these changes, the issue of beach erosion has been recognized as one of the most important and controversial coastal problems in the country. Hence coastal protection is required which they have to be designed, constructed and maintained efficiently (Pilarczyk and Zeidler, 1996). This case study on beach erosion was conducted at Haeundae Beach in Busan, located in the south coast of Korea. Haeundae Beach is regarded as the most popular and beautiful urban beach in Korea. One of the main purposes of this study is to take comprehensive countermeasures to mitigate the beach erosion problem at Haeundae Beach. The historical investigations, field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted to understand the problems and to obtain solutions for countermeasures. The laboratory experiments of 3D hydraulic model tests qualitatively reproduced erosion patterns and rip currents that were shown in numerical simulations. The results of laboratory experiments showed improvements in the countermeasure plan using both beach nourishment and submerged breakwaters from erosion.

AB  - There are several arguments to be discussed for the probability of hazards due to the storm surge. One is a common point of describing the uncertainty of extreme events, and another point is for the special case due to the storm surge. 1) Return level is one of the important results by extreme value analysis, and the confidence interval also serves us an useful and desirable information for uncertainty. Is it true? The answer is negative. Return period is right, and important. But the confidence interval, in this case, is shown for return level which is the constant value that is significant after the repeating encounters of the exceedance levels over very long period. But it is of our interest to know which value is the successively occurring level in the future return period, which is a stochastic variable. It is not a constant value but unknown even for the God. The prediction interval should be employed for the next realized value of our interest.

AB  - This study focuses on sediment exchange dynamics in Mwache Creek, a shallow tidal mangrove wetland in Kenya. The surface area of the creek is 17 km2 at high water spring. The creek experiences semidiurnal tides with tidal ranges of 3.2 m and 1.4 m during spring and neap tides, respectively. The creek is ebb dominant in the frontwater zone main channel and is flood dominant in the backwater zone main channel. During rainy season, the creek receives freshwater and terrigenous sediments from the seasonal Mwache River. Heavy supply of terrigenous sediments during the El Niño of 1997-1998 led to the huge deposition of sediments (10(60 tonnes) in the wetland that caused massive destruction of the mangrove forest in the upper region. In this study, sea level, tidal discharges, tidal current velocities, salinity, total suspended sediment concentrations (TSSC) and particulate organic sediment concentrations (POSC) measured in stations established within the main channel and also within the mangrove forests, were used to determine the dynamics of sediment exchange between the frontwater and backwater zones of the main channel including also the exchange with mangrove forests. The results showed that during wet seasons, the high suspended sediment concentration associated with river discharge and tidal resuspension of fine channel-bed sediment accounts for the inflow of highly turbid water into the degraded mangrove forest. Despite the degradation of the mangrove forest, sediment outflow from the mangrove forest was considerably less than the inflow. This caused a net trapping of sediment in the wetland. The net import of the sediment dominated in spring tide during both wet and dry season and during neap tide in the wet season. However, as compared to heavily vegetated mangrove wetlands, the generally degraded Mwache Creek mangrove wetland sediment trapping efficiency is low as the average is about 30% for the highly degraded backwater zone mangrove forest and 65% in the moderately degraded frontwater zone mangrove forest.

AB  - The Beresford shoreline, Australia, is subject to a complex interaction of coastal processes and associated erosion. In support of the design of a coastal protection scheme a SWASH model has been set up capable of accounting for all the complex processes at hand. The model has successfully been validated against measured wave and current conditions. In the design process the validated SWASH model proved to be a valuable tool to assess the impact of various coastal protection schemes like groynes on the wave-driven current patterns and associated sediment pathways.

AB  - To protect and restore coastal ecosystems, scientists and managers need reliable, up-to-date information on how and why these systems are changing. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft offer cost-effective means for determining the rates and causes of ecosystem changes. The U. D. Center for Remote Sensing has been developing remote sensing techniques for observing changes of landscape-level, coastal environmental indicators, including wetland size, biomass, fragmentation; invasive species; riparian buffers; estuarine suspended sediment and chlorophyll concentrations. One particularly useful result is a method for detecting changes of wetland and upland vegetation using biomass as an indicator. By employing a vegetation index (MSA VI) which is locally normalized, we minimize the effects of atmospheric, weather and seasonal differences between images in a time series. This model is applied to a time-series of medium resolution (30 m) Landsat/TM images in a GIS to identify and “flag” areas where significant change has occurred. Only the “flagged” areas are then examined in more detail with more expensive high-resolution (1 - 4 m) IKONOS satellite or aerial imagery.

AB  - The various aspects of Great Swamp effluent management system (EMS) in South Carolina's Low Country are discussed. The Great Swamp EMS includes about 194 ha of riverine floodplain wetlands along the New River. The Great Swamp EMS is permitted under the US National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) surface water discharge permit. The permit allows the use of swamp forest for management of reclaimed water subject to strict requirements related to protection of water quality and ecological functions. The Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority (BJWSA) has added the program of wetlands mitigation to the effluent management concept.

AB  - Carbonaceous cherts in Proterozoic carbonate sequences provide an exceptionally clear record of early microbial life, but one that is significantly biased with respect to the range of environments inhabited by contemporary organisms. Many of the best preserved Proterozoic microfossil assemblages come from microbial mats and organicrich muds that accumulated in protected coastal areas where a combination of high productivity, limited water circulation, and, often, hypersalinity limited post mortem degradation. The close distributional relationship between early diagenetic silica and organic matter can be explained in terms of a model developed by Leo and Barghoorn for the silicification of wood. Three factors appear to control the distribution of early diagenetic chert in Proterozoic sequences: sediment permeability, availability of silica in ground water solution, and locally high concentrations of organic matter in near-surface sediments. Of these, organic content appears to impose the major environmental bias. In terms of their excellent preservation, geochemistry of formation, and limited environmental coverage, Phanerozoic silicified peats bear comparison with their Proterozoic counterparts. Swamp dwellers may be the plants most likely to be preserved exceptionally well, but they may also be the plants least likely to give rise to new populations that will become ecologically widespread and evolutionarily important in subsequent periods. Allochthonous elements in permineralized peats may be unusually important to palaeobotany because they combine the exceptional preservation conferred by peat permineralization with ecological representation of floodplain and upland evolutionary cradles rather than swampland museums.

AB  - Salt marsh plants are effective in stabilizing eroding shorelines in many sheltered coastal areas. Exceptional results have been achieved in a variety of intertidal environments at a fraction of the cost required for comparable structural protection. Techniques are available for the efficient propagation of several marsh plants for use in shore stabilization. This report provides a method for determining site suitability, establishes guidelines for planting marshes to control erosion, and compares the costs of vegetation to structural methods of erosion control.-Authors

AB  - Morphological and biogeographical evidence suggests that the heavy-metal ecotype of Armeria maritima (Mill.) Willd. has evolved from a hybrid group between the subspecies maritima from salt marshes and the subspecies elongata from sandy soils. As part of a study on the ecotypic differentiation in A. maritima, Zn resistance was compared in populations from these three ecotypes. To study the long-term growth response to elevated Zn concentrations, an artificial soil was made from ion-exchange resin embedded in an inert sand matrix, in which metal ions were buffered by an ion-exchange system as in natural soils. In contrast to hydroponics, this artificial soil systems is suitable for long-term cultivation and it provides more reproducible growth conditions than a soil system. The long-term growth response in the artificial soil system was compared to the growth response to elevated Zn concentrations in a sand nutrient-solution system. In short-term tests, populations from non-metalliferous soils were more sensitive to Zn concentrations of 1.0 mmol I -1 than the heavy-metal populations. However, in long-term tests, the growth of adult plants from all populations was not inhibited by Zn concentrations up to 2.8 mmol kg -1 dry soil (equivalent 26% of cation-exchange capacity). The Zn resistance of all populations could therefore be sufficient for their survival on Zn mine soils. The discrepancy between long-term tests and short-term tests is discussed with respect to the hypothesis that 'sensitive' populations may differ from 'resistant' populations in the expression of Zn-resistance mechanisms.

AB  - To protect shorelines from erosion, Ontario Hydro is using armourstone at various Generating Stations along the perimeter of the Great Lakes. Armourstone is carefully evaluated prior to usage to ensure as far as possible that the material is suitable to withstand the effects of freezing-thawing, wetting-drying and erosion by water, wind and ice. Laboratory tests include unit weight, relative density, porosity, water absorption, freeze-thaw soundness and sonic velocity. Inspection and acceptance of armourstone is undertaken at the quarry prior to shipment. In an effort to determine the longevity of armourstone in service under severe climatic conditions, specimens of various rock types were assessed and marked at Nanticoke TGS in 1971. Results of a reassessment, which was undertaken twenty years after the original evaluation, are discussed.

AB  - Northfield Ponds, a 35-acre park, is part of Denver's Stapleton Redevelopment Project, as a new mixed use `New Urbanist' community. Engineers originally conceived the site as a storm water detention and water quality facility with little enhancement beyond the typical concrete pipes and structures, erosion control, and proposed grass seeding. The proposed design opened the area to public use yet provided native plant and wetland habitat that would contribute to the area's natural resources. The facility is organized into three `cells' for storm water management and accommodates 1600 cfs of inflowing runoff from 460 acres of commercially developed land. A river delta typology for landforms and water courses, complete with meandering braided streams and droplet shaped islands of varying sizes, were proposed for the design. Forebays and drainage structures were designed as attractive architectural elements in the landscape. The `delta' design concept was emphasized and enhanced with the planting design of herbaceous and woody plant material native to the West's high plains. Plantings were carefully field located to follow mapped and observed groundwater contours so that plants will sustain themselves through droughts typical to the Denver area. Bioengineering practices where used on the downstream side of the forebays with the intent of spreading water across outlets to reduce the concentration of flows that would cause channelization of the run-off. Northfield Ponds is a successful example of blending the needs of storm water management with sustainable ecological goals, creating an aesthetic and useful passive park for users to observe urban wildlife.

AB  - As a component of the Masonville Dredged Material Containment Facility (DMCF) project, the Maryland Port Administration (MPA) was required to develop a compensatory mitigation package to offset impacts associated with filling approximately 130 acres of open water in the Patapsco River, which is a major tributary to the Chesapeake Bay. The mitigation approved for the project is a comprehensive package of inwater and upland environmental restoration projects totaling over $20 million, primarily located adjacent to the DMCF in 90 acres of open water and 54 acres of uplands that comprise Masonville Cove. The projects serve to enhance the environment and provide improved habitat and increased wildlife use of the area, in addition to remediating contamination from historical industrial usage and dumping. The projects discussed in this paper include over 2 miles of shoreline restoration and stabilization using created fringe marshes with sandy beaches and living shorelines behind offshore rock breakwaters, 90 acres of reef creation and substrate improvement, 15 acres of creation and enhancement of tidal and non-tidal wetlands, and 30 acres of upland capping of contaminated soil. Design development concepts for these projects are presented along with reports on the completed construction that describe practical measures used to achieve the goals of the restoration. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The White Sea of Russian Arctic is characterized by extreme diversity of enclosed estuarine systems that are often sites of unique biota. The present study focuses on surface sediments from representative restricted exchange environments of the inner part of Kandalaksha Bay, adjacent to the Karelian shore of the White Sea. The TOC and n-alkanes distribution study revealed the major input of terrestrial organic matter into the sediments from higher plants and minor presence of autochthonous microbial sources. Metal (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb) forms study showed that metals in sediments occur mainly in a biogeochemically stable mineral-incorporated form, which comprises up to 98% of total metal content, while labile (acid soluble) and organically bound (alkali soluble) forms make up to 3-11% and 2-12% of total metal content, respectively. Presumably, the major part of both acid soluble and alkali soluble forms is comprised of metals associated with easily soluble amorphous Fe-oxides and bound to sediment organic matter. According to sediment quality guidelines, all trace-metal contents were below the threshold levels. Among sites studied, the heightened contents of bioavailable metal forms are related to sediments enriched in organic matter and/or located within the sea-fresh water barrier zones. The elements studied may be arranged in the following decreasing sequence according to their potential bioavailability: Cu > Zn > Mn > Fe > Cr > Pb. The present study can serve as a basis for comprehensive environmental assessment of the region and objective anoxia prognosis in Arctic ecosystems, while the role of microbial community in element speciation in sediments needs special attention.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina did massive damage because New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were not appropriately protected. Wherever natural disasters threaten the government-in its traditional role as public goods provider-must decide what level of protection to provide to an area. It does so by purchasing protective capital such as levees for a low-lying city. ("Protection" also consists of prohibiting projects that raise risk levels such as draining swamps.) We show that if private capital is more likely to locate in better-protected areas as would be expected then the marginal social value of protection will increase with the level of protection provided. That is the benefit function is convex contrary to the normal assumption of concavity. When the government protects and the private sector invests there may be multiple Nash equilibria due to the ill-behaved nature of the benefit function. Policy makers must compare them rather than merely follow local optimality conditions to find the equilibrium offering the highest social welfare. There is usually considerable uncertainty about the amount of private investment that will accompany any level of protection further complicating the government's choice problem. We show that when deciding on the level of protection to provide now the government must take account of the option value of increasing the level of protection in the future. We briefly examine but dismiss the value of rules of thumb such as building for 1000-year floods or other rules that ignore benefits and costs. © Springer Science + Business Media LLC 2006.

AB  - The paralic sediments of Delaware's Atlantic coast and estuary include a continuous depositional record of Holocene sediments from 11 000yr BP. These sediments were deposited in landward migrating environments of the Holocene marine transgression superimposed and eroding into a trellis-like topography of the ancestral Delaware River (circa 15 000). Tidal waters fringed with salt marsh sediments first intruded into the inner shelf area 12 000-14 000 BP. As sea level rose, the tributary valleys were inundated by tidal waters beginning 10 000-11 000 BP at 30m below sea level. These tidal marshes extended along the ancestral drainage system up to 100km inland from the projected early Holocene Atlantic shoreline.By 7000 BP, a lagoon-barrier coastal system had developed on the adjacent Atlantic coastal inner shelf area. This system has migrated landward by shoreface erosion and upward by rise in relative sea level to its present coastal position. -from Authors

AB  - The adequate initialisation of spatially varying grain size distributions of bottom sediment is one of the prime restrictions in coastal morphodynamic modelling often due to a lack of appropriate field data. Commonly, a uniform distribution in the model domain is chosen based on the author's judgement on the limited data available. In this study, a process-based morphodynamic numerical model is set up evaluating the fate of single non-cohesive grain size fractions (ranging from 100 - 2000 mu m) to determine grain size characteristics of bottom sediment based on consideration of the local hydrodynamics and morphodynamic processes. The study site is the natural barrier-enclosed meso-tidal lagoon of Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. The mean grain size values predicted by the model in the immediate inlet area are compared to values derived from a previous sampling campaign in 1978. Results indicate the potential of this approach to predict grain size distributions, provided the governing processes are adequately represented by the model.

AB  - Establishing a marine reserve constitutes one of the most important objectives for the conservation of marine environment and protection of the marine life. Palm Islands situated north Lebanon was declared as National Reserve by an official Declaration law in 1992. These three uninhabited small rocky islands situated at 6 miles offshore Al-Mina-Tripoli, constitute the only insular reserve on the Levantine coast. Amongst the seven small islands, the largest three: Palm Island, Sanani, and Ramkine, are suitable for a settlement of a marine reserve. They are distant about 800 m from each other and separated by shallow water 10-12 m with rocky bottom platform formed during the Miocene era. The rocky bottom surrounding the islands is covered with sandy, muddy sediments and gravel: The total area of the islands is 270.000 m(2) and the highest point in Ramkine is 12 m above sea level. The land is swampy with few freshwater wells and few small vegetation (flowers and herbs) The islands were classified as International Bird Area by the Life Bird International; since they constitute a refuge for seabirds and landing station for migratory birds. There is a nesting community for several seabirds from genus Larus. West and SW coasts are of rocky eroded feature and exposed to the strong wind and heavy waves, Intertidal and infralittoral zones are covered with dense and diversified algae meadows. The East and NE sandy beach are formed at 90% with shells wrecks and organic particles. Temperature of seawater ranges between 16 degrees C in February and 30 degrees C in August. Flora which is highly diversified includes all species of microalgae and macroalgae Fauna, although poor in standing crop, shows a high taxonomic diversity; all groups and species of Zooplankton, Nekton, Fishes, Micro and Macrozoobenthos inhabiting the Levantine Basin are found in this area. Palm Islands which are considered as a National Protected Area is a nice place for ecotourism and a natural laboratory for education, scientific research and recreation. Fishing and wild picnics are strictly forbidden and visits are organized and managed by Ministries of Environment and Tourism

AB  - Soil bioengineering is an appropriate approach to deal with erosion problems and shallow seated landslides especially in developing countries such as Nepal. This technique is a cost-effective solution using locally available materials and low-cost labour. Furthermore, this approach allows the involvement of the local population in the management and maintenance aspects. As an example for prevention of soil erosion and increased slope stability by means of vegetation, a landslide in the Middle Mountains of Nepal was selected for an innovative approach of rescheduling the implementation of soil bioengineering stabilisation works into the dry, winter season, testing plants for their suitability and using cut bamboo (Bambusa nutans G. C. Wall.) for the construction of vegetated crib walls. This paper deals with investigation, design, construction and monitoring over a period of 32 months. Soil bioengineering solutions for erosion control and shallow slope instabilities in the Middle Mountains proved to be highly successful and all plants, in particular Salix tetrasperma Roxb. and Alnus nepalensis Don., seemed to be suitable for winter plantation.

AB  - Since 1982, large-scale coastal protection works have taken place on the Danish North Sea coast. The subject of the first part ofthis paper is the coastal protection policy, the engineering approaches to erosion and flood control and the results achieved. An important tool for coastal protection has always been and still is nourishment. In the second part of the paper, the effect of the nourishment will be evaluated with focus on the positioning of the nourishment in the profile and on the use of coarse materials.

AB  - Hervey Bay City Council is a medium sized local government authority with management responsibility over 60km of coastline. At a small coastal village to the north of the main urban area in Hervey Bay, Australia, persistent coastal erosion and poor planning decisions over the past 50 years has left private property at immediate risk of loss. Hervey Bay City Council identified the need to undertake coastal protection works at this location and initiated a project to better understand the physical processes shaping the coastline and to prepare various options to address the conflict between the eroding beach and the developed shoreline. This paper examines the challenges faced by local government in selecting and implementing shoreline protection strategies in Queensland, whilst attempting to manage the diverse pressures from the community, Elected Officials and State Government Agencies. It recommends improved integration and consultation between State Government Agencies and with Local Government to ensure improved delivery and streamlined timelines for coastal protection works for Local Government.

AB  - Coastal zones are productive areas that serve as nursery grounds for a large number of marine species. However, the processes involved in survival success during the juvenile phase are not well-known. Some authors suggest that the availability of prey is important to support the production of pre-recruit fish whose fitness is enhanced through optimal feeding conditions. Accordingly, recruitment is limited by the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. In contrast, other authors state that the carrying capacity of the nursery grounds is not fully exploited, suggesting that there is no effect of food limitation. This study combines an overview of the literature, focused on flatfish that are especially dependent on coastal and estuarine nursery grounds, an extension to other marine fishes and a modelling approach on growth and survival of juvenile fish to explore the controversy of food limitation in their nursery grounds. We demonstrate that the relative lack of growth limitation observed for young marine fishes at the individual scale is related to an observational bias: fish have been affected by size-selective mortality linked to food limitation, but only surviving individuals are observed. As the population is skewed towards the faster-growing juveniles, the growth of survivors remains close to optimal, even when food resources are limited. Food limitation is of major influence in determining the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. To sustain marine fish populations and related fisheries, management action is needed to protect coastal and estuarine areas and maintain or restore nursery productivity.

AB  - The Mekong River delta plays an important role in the Vietnamese economy and it has been severely impacted during this century by a series of unusually large floods. In the dry season the delta is also impacted by salinity intrusion and tides. These effects have caused severe human hardship. To mitigate these impacts, a large number of engineering structures, primarily dykes and weirs, have been built in the delta in recent years and are still being built, mainly to control floods and saltwater intrusion. These control measures are still being upgraded. A GIS-linked numerical model shows that the flood levels in the delta depend on the combined impacts of high river flows in the Mekong River, storm surges, sea level rise, and the likely, future siltation of the Mekong Estuary resulting from the construction of dams in China as well as many other dams proposed throughout the remaining river catchment. The model suggests that the engineering structures in the delta increase the flow velocities in the rivers and canals, increasing bank erosion, and cause the water to be deeper in the rivers and canals. This increases flooding in the non-protected areas of the delta and increases the risk of catastrophic failure of the dykes in the protected areas. The model also predicts that a sea level rise induced by global warming will enhance flooding in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, and that flooding may worsen in the long term as a result of estuarine siltation resulting from the construction of dams. At the scale of the Mekong River basin, a multinational water resources management plan is needed that includes the hydrological needs of the delta. At the scale of the delta, a compromise is needed between allowing some flooding necessary for agriculture and preventing catastrophic flooding to alleviate human suffering.

AB  - The State of Louisiana (LA) Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) conducts extensive analytical modeling and project evaluations across an expansive coastal region along the Gulf of Mexico as part of updates to the State’s Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast (CMP) on 5-year recurring intervals. The 2017 CMP includes a combination of 45 risk reduction and 79 coastal restoration projects with projected construction and implementation over a 50-year period through 2065 at a projected cost of $50 billion dollars. Risk reduction includes 13 structural and 32 non-structural projects. Structural risk reduction projects consist of continuation of new construction and maintenance of an extensive system of earthen levees, flood walls, flood gates, and pump stations. Non-structural projects consist of a combination of acquisition, elevating, and flood-proofing of residential and commercial structures within projected coastal storm flood risk areas. The Lake Pontchartrain Barrier structural risk reduction project has projected one of the highest cost-effectiveness (CE) values of all CMP projects. This paper will focus on hydrodynamic and risk reduction modeling performed to evaluate a series of conceptual design alternatives for the Lake Pontchartrain Barrier (LPB).

AB  - Managed realignment - The deliberate process of realigning river, estuary or coastal defences - Is increasingly seen as a key element to sustainable long term flood and coastal management in the UK and other parts of the world, given current trends of sea level rise, and increasing costs of flood and coastal defence. This paper presents results of an extensive consultation of key stakeholders in England and Wales on what they consider to be the main drivers, of and obstacles to, managed realignment. It reveals why managed realignment has not taken place on a larger scale so far, and suggests new directions for a long-term strategic approach to river and coastal flood management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The availability and plant uptake of heavy metals was evaluated from contaminated dredged material placed in flooded and upland disposal environments using a solid-phase plant bioassay. The objective of the study was to verify previous dredged material research results and to develop a plant bioassay procedure that could indicate phytotoxicity and bioaccumulation of heavy metals in contaminated dredged material. The plant bioassay indicated more uptake and bioaccumulations of cadmium and, to a lesser extent, zinc when contaminated dredged material was placed in an upland environment where the sediment was allowed to air-dry. Placing the contaminated dredged material in a flooded (reduced) environment lowered the availability and plant uptake of cadmium and, to a lesser extent, zinc. Factors that influenced the availability and plant uptake of heavy metals from contaminated sediments included sediment oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter content, total sulfur content, and pH. The plant bioassay showed phytotoxicity and bioaccumulation of arsenic under a flooded environment. Placing the arsenic-contaminated sediment in an upland environment reduced both the phytotoxicity and bioaccumulation of arsenic in the freshwater marsh plant Cyperus esculentus .

AB  - The extreme sea level due to storm surge and future sea-level rise (SLR) in the year of 2050 and 2100 are estimated by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extreme value analysis (EVA) with long-term sea level records in and around the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, an adaptive data analysis method, can separate the tidal motions and the non-linear trend from the sea level records to reconstruct the storm surge levels, and then the reconstructed storm surge levels are applied to statistical model, EVA, to obtain the extreme storm surges at 95% confidence interval in the target return periods. The SLR trend at Tokuyama in the Seto Inland Sea obtained from EEMD is 3.58 mm/yr over 1993-2010, which is slightly larger than the recent altimetry based global rate of 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr over 1993-2007. The resulting SLR in 2050 and 2100 estimated are 0.18 m and 0.49 m, respectively. The 30-, 50-, and 100-yr return levels at Tokuyama obtained by EVA are 1.30 m, 1.43 m and 1.64 m. Therefore, the extreme sea level in 2050 and 2100 due to future SLR and storm surge with 100-yr return level would be 1.82 m (1.35 m ∼ 2.26 m with 95% confidence intervals) and 2.13 m (1.75 m ∼ 3.10 m with 95% confidence intervals), respectively. The SLR is not only due to mass and volume changes of sea water, but also due to other factors such as local subsidence, river discharge and sediments, and vegetation effect. The non-linear trend of SLR, which is the residue from EEMD, can be regarded as a final consequential sea level after considering those factors and their nonlinearity. The combined EEMD-EVA method can be useful tool not only for the extreme sea level estimation under climate change, but also for many cases in coastal engineering and hydrology.

AB  - In order to protect coastal facilities mainly from wave and current actions, the self-locking eco blocks constituting elements of protecting shore structures against scouring were designed. These blocks are adapted to the sloping bottom, coastal dunes, and submerged coastal pipelines, counteracting the destructive and erosive impulse action. A series of laboratory experiments has been conducted to investigate the reflection of water waves over and against a train of protruded or submerged shore structures and compare the reflecting capabilities of incident waves including wave forces. In this study the hydraulic model experiment was conducted to identify the performance of newly designed water affinity eco blocks to keep the coast slope and bottom mound from scouring by reduction of the wave reflection and to convince stability of the block placement. Revised design of each block element was also tested for field conditions. From the result of experiments, the field applicability of the developed blocks and placement was discussed afterward.

AB  - ABSTRACT Wetlands are among the most sensitive of habitats to oil spills. A field experiment was conducted on a salt marsh in Atlantic Canada to determine the significance of bioremediation by nutrient enrichment in enhancing wetland restoration. Six experimental treatments were monitored: (1) unoiled control (2) unoiled control + nutrients, (3) oil with no treatment (natural attenuation), (4) oil + nutrients, (5) oil + nutrients with plants cut back, (6) oil + nutrients with disking (tilling) to enrich oxygen penetration. Remediation success was quantified by determining changes in the composition and concentration of the residual oil, plant recovery and reduction in sediment toxicity. The experimental results advocate natural attenuation as the clean-up strategy for the ecotype under study. Within the untreated plots, significant recovery of the predominant plant species within the marsh (Spartina alterniflora) was observed after 20 weeks and approximately 90% of the resolved n-alkanes and 70% of the pa...

AB  - Biological processes and physical characteristics associated with seagrass can greatly affect acoustic propagation in coastal regions. An important acoustical effect is due to bubble production by the plants, which can have significant impact on both object detection and bottom mapping sonars by increasing clutter through reflection, absorption, and scattering of sound. In addition to photosynthesis bubbles and gas-bearing leaf tissue in the water column, the plant rhizomes also contain aerenchyma (gas-filled channels), which allow for diffusion of oxygen into the surrounding sediment. To study these effects, in situ acoustic measurements were conducted in a bed of Thalassia testudium in east Corpus Christi Bay, TX. Direct measurements of sound speed and attenuation were obtained in the water column above the seagrass canopy, inside the seagrass canopy, and at discrete depths within the sediment. A complimentary set of measurements were obtained in a bare sediment region located a few meters away. In addi...

AB  - ABSTRACT Several studies conducted in Prince William Sound during 1989 were directed at assessing short term biological effects of treatment methods considered or employed for treating oil contaminated beaches. The four treatment alternatives evaluated in this paper are: low pressure warm water wash (LP-WW); high pressure hot water wash (HP-HW); the dispersant Corexit 7664; and the beach cleaner Corexit 9580 M2. Effects on the biota were assessed primarily on the basis of changes in the abundance of dominant taxa and the magnitude of selected community attributes (such as percent cover by algae or animals, and number of taxa). Significant reductions in one or more community or population attributes, and increases in the percent of dead mussels were observed in response to all types of treatment but the strongest and most consistent effects were observed following high pressure hot water treatment, which was also accompanied by heavy mortality in rockweed. Generally, the programs were not designed to discriminate among the potential causes of damage. However, available data suggest that neither chemical nor LP-WW treatments caused significant thermal impacts in the intertidal biota. In contrast, temperature appeared to cause significant mortality in the dominant plants and grazing and filter-feeding animals in HP-HW treatment sites. Observations of displacement and mortality for clams and mussels suggest that physical effects may be substantial in some cases. Of the types of treatment examined, dispersant and beach cleaner treatments appeared to be accompanied with the smallest number of significant changes in abundance; however, this conclusion is weak because the LP-WW wash accompanying chemical applications during the tests was sometimes less rigorous than when performed by itself. LP-WW treatment was accompanied by an intermediate level of changes whereas HP-HW treatment was accompanied with the highest percentage of changes, nearly all of which were decreases. Based upon long term surveys in the area, HP-HW treatment caused severe and persistent effects that remained conspicuous as late as July 1992. The long term consequences of dispersant and beach cleaner applications have not been evaluated.

AB  - A monitoring programme has been established for the 351 km of the UK Southern North Sea Coast (between the Humber and Thames estuaries). This has produced over 3300 beach profiles captured to a clear specification at 1 km intervals in summer and winter since 1991. The analysis of this data has been previously linked to specific flood defence and coastal protection engineering schemes. The first analysis on a region wide basis has now been undertaken to provide some strategic insight into how the coast is evolving on an Integrated Scale. The analysis provides quantification of the change at the coast, and demonstrates that simple analytical tools combined with geomorphological interpretation can provide meaningful information for coastal management.

AB  - Oysters are ecosystem engineers that create biogenic reef habitat important to estuarine biodiversity, benthic-pelagic coupling, and fishery production, Prevailing explanations for the dramatic decline of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) during the last century overlook ecosystem complexity by ignoring interactions among multiple environmental disturbances. To explain oyster loss, we tested whether (1) mortality of oysters on natural oyster reefs varies with water depth (3 m vs. 6 m), (2) harvesting by oyster dredges reduces the height of oyster reefs, and (3) bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia and reduction in reef height through fishery disturbance interact to enhance mortality of oysters in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. The percentage of oysters found dead (mean +/- 1 SD) during a survey of natural reefs in May 1993 was significantly greater at 6-m (92 +/- 10%) than at 3-m (28 +/- 9%) water depth. Less than one season's worth of oyster dredging reduced the height of restored oyster reefs by similar to 30%. During stratification of the water column in summer, oxygen depletion near the seafloor at 6 m caused mass mortality of oysters, other invertebrates, and fishes on short, deep experimental reefs, while oysters and other reef associates elevated into the surface layer by sufficient reef height or by location in shallow water survived. Highly mobile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) abandoned burrows located in hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters but remained alive in shallow water, Our results indicate that interaction of reef habitat degradation (height reduction) through fishery disturbance and extended bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia caused the pattern of oyster mortality observed on natural reefs and influences the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrate species that utilize this temperate reef habitat. Interactions among environmental disturbances imply a need for the integrative approaches of ecosystem management to restore and sustain estuarine habitat.

AB  - In 2017, the Texas General Land Office (GLO) released the first Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan, an ambitious coastal planning effort to restore, enhance and protect more than 367 miles of coast and some 3,300 miles of bays and estuaries for the State of Texas. The lynchpin of the planning effort is its emphasis on shoring up the coast by using the latest coastal technology backed by research on Texas coastal environments, coastal hydrodynamics and morphology, and sediment supply, among others, in conjunction with federal, public, and private entity coordination. By championing a statewide Plan to guide the future of coastal management, the GLO will assure that Texas continues to restore, enhance, and protect its coastlines and communities. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - A comprehensive investigation of Canadian boreal forest fires was conducted using NOAA-AVHRR. Algorithms were developed for detecting active fires (hotspots), burned areas, and smoke plumes, which employ single images and 10-day Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. The hotspot algorithm was applied to four years (1994-97) of imagery, producing a daily fire mask for Canada. Almost all fire events were detected, but cumulative hotspot area was significantly smaller (/spl sim/30%) than burned area reported by fire agencies. To provide more accurate estimates of burned area, a burn mapping algorithm was developed that synergistically combines the hotspot product with anniversary date NDVI composites. The hybrid technique produced estimates of Canada-wide burned area that were within 5 percent of official statistics. A neural-network classifier was also developed that allows smoke plumes to be effectively separated from cloud cover at a regional scale.

AB  - Vegetation and soil properties were described across a well-dated sand-dune chronosequence bordering northern Lake Michigan to document patterns and rates of primary succession and forest ecosystem development, and to determine environmental constraints that potentially drive succession and regulate species diversity. The site experienced frequent and continuing formation of 72 shore-parallel dune ridges over the past 2375 yr. Across the chronosequence represented by the youngest 13 dune ridges aged 25-440 yr, there were clear patterns of species turnover and community convergence as well as successional changes in species diversity, aboveground biomass, aboveground litter production, net ecosystem production, nutrient pools, and nutrient cycling. Dune-building species were replaced by evergreen shrubs and bunchgrass within 100 yr, which in turn, were replaced by mixed pine forest within 345 yr. Plant-species richness increased to a peak in developing forest at 285 yr but thereafter decreased as early-successional species disappeared from the communities. Rates of species addition peaked between 95 and 145 yr as forest species invaded, whereas rates of species loss peaked between 345 and 440 yr as early-successional species were lost from the developing forest. Development of the forest ecosystem required similar to 300 yr (i.e., 145-440 years). Total ecosystem carbon increased in a logistic manner to 128 Mg C/ha, with net ecosystem production peaking at 30 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) in developing forest. Aboveground biomass and O horizon mass increased to similar to 137 Mg/ha and similar to 79 Mg/ha, respectively, whereas aboveground litter production increased to 3.5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) at 440 yr, but thereafter varied between 175 and 350 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1). Total carbon and total nitrogen in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil and O horizon accumulated to similar to 42 Mg/ha and similar to 1.36 Mg/ha, respectively. Estimated average rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation over 440 yr of ecosystem aggradation were 23.2 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for carbon and 0.38 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for nitrogen. Because nitrogen-fixing plants are rare on the upland dune ridges, ecosystem aggradation depends largely on atmospheric nitrogen inputs. Following colonization by conifers, soil acidification resulted in rapid leaching losses of calcium and magnesium, whereas phosphorus and potassium were cycled more tightly. The dune chronosequence represents a complex gradient of changing environmental constraints that differentially reduce the survival, growth, and reproduction of plant species. Young dune ridges near the lake shore are characterized by strong winds, sand burial and erosion, high insolation, high rates of evaporation, and low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. These conditions ameliorate with increasing dune age as wind velocities and sand movement diminish with distance from the lake, as accumulating organic matter improves the moisture-holding capacity and nitrogen availability of the soil, and as mineral weathering mobilizes soil phosphorus. However, in developing forest, light and cationic nutrients may become limiting, and decreased light availability, cool soil temperatures, and accumulation of a thick forest floor may limit recruitment from seed for many species. These numerous potential environmental constraints suggest a considerable complexity in this ostensibly simple ecosystem.

AB  - <jats:p>Close to ninety percent of Guyana‟s population live along a low lying coastal plain, which is below sea level and very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While the national government has not yet developed a comprehensive climate policy, the potential impacts of climate change is considered in several sectoral policies, much of which emphasize mitigation, with little focus on adaptation. This research examined the current priorities for adaptation by a review of the policies within the natural resource sector to identify opportunities for adaptation, especially ecosystem based adaptation. A Diagnostic Adaptation Framework (DAF) was used to help identify approaches to address a given adaptation challenge with regards to needs, measures and options. A survey questionnaire was used to support the policy reviews and identified four key vulnerabilities: coastal floods; sea level rise; drought and extreme weather events. The application of the DAF in selecting an adaptation method suggests the need for more data on drought and extreme weather events. Coastal flooding is addressed, with recognized need for more data and public awareness for ecosystem based adaptation</jats:p>

AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted.) In 1993 and 1998, at the beginning and toward the end of Zhu Rongji's tenure as China's economic czar, plummeting global crude oil prices precipitated macroeconomic crises and eroded the profitability of domestic oil companies. Each crisis exposed the high opportunity costs of supporting state-owned enterprises (SOEs); yet the central government's responses differed dramatically in each case. In 1993, Zhu Rongji relaxed the ministerial division of labor and devolved strategic and financial decisions to individual SOEs. He also leaned on two powerful levers of the planned economy-central government pricing and tax authority-to balance the conflicting interests of the oil and petrochemical producers. In doing so, he deferred an opportunity for substantial restructuring. In 1998, Zhu Rongji went in the opposite direction. He pushed for the recentralization of control over state assets through Western forms of corporate organization and the consolidation of SOEs' share of the national market, coupled with significant liberalization of the pricing and trade regimes. The combined effect was the decisive dismantling of the "Plan" as the dominant means of governing the oil and petrochemical industries. What were the political and economic factors leading to these divergent responses? As a top global oil producer, China was remarkably insulated from transnational oil politics in the first decade and a half of post-Mao reform. With the country largely self-sufficient in domestic supply and demand up to 1993, the State Council kept the oil industry wholly nationally owned and subservient to the broader rapid developmental goals of the post-Mao era.1 Yet, even in autarkic (not reliant on imports) or highly protected sectors operating under regulated prices, global price shocks create pressures on domestic interests that feel acutely the opportunity costs of economic closure.2 I argue that the differences in outcomes in these two episodes stemmed from the intervening impacts of the general macroeconomic and industry-specific aggregate supply and demand imbalances. These "disequilibria" altered the relative interests and capabilities of Chinese central bureaucrats, local states and industrial entities to adjust to global price shocks within the decentralized framework. In particular, two major disequilibria cleared the way politically for radical enterprise reform in the late 1990s. The first came in 1996, when the Chinese economy crossed a critical threshold of economic transition-from a postsocialist shortage economy into a surplus economy marked by overcapacity in industrial production and by deflationary pressures. This macroeconomic disequilibrium knocked the political wind out of the early beneficiaries of decentralization, as failing firms and fiscally endangered local states were unable to adjust to price shocks. In contrast, in 1993 these interests had been capturing rent from the post-1992 economic boom, and hastened to marshal financial and political resources to resist Zhu Rongji's efforts to take back central control. The second disequilibrium came in 1997 as depressed global crude prices and a flood of cheap imports from Southeast Asian producers hit by the Asian Financial Crisis led to widespread failures of both the upstream and downstream interests-the oilfields and the refineries. This was not the case in the early 1990s, when the downstream interests consistently benefited from domestic price controls at the expense of the upstream. As a result, the persistent conflict of interest between the oil and petrochemical industry dissolved temporarily, creating a window of opportunity to change the pricing mechanism fundamentally. In short, by 1998 the broad coalition of local governments, enterprise managers and central ministerial interests in support of the decentralized framework of reform had neither the interest nor the resources to continue defending the status quo. …

Dune enhancement or reconstruction is considered to be a solution to avoid the negative effects on the ecological and aesthetic values of the coast by those engineering structures. Two field experiments were conducted for dune building at the Tainan coast in Taiwan. Experimental sets, including artificial vegetation, sand fence deployment and the bulldozed dunes with different surface pavements, were set up to re-build the foredune that have been previously damaged. A small natural remnant dune was chosen as the comparison set for evaluating the effectiveness of the sand accumulation and vegetation growth. The dune reconstruction processes were observed by monitoring the changes of dune profiles, surface sand grain size, and the vegetation density. The experiment results are used to suggest an appropriate dune rehabilitation procedure for this area. The results reveal that a bulldozed dune can raise the height immediately, and putting oyster racks on the bare surface can help the accumulation of sand and the colonization of vegetation that will quickly stabilize the artificial foredune. Sand surface covered with oyster shells may avoid wind erosion at the beginning, but it also hampered the vegetation colonization. Muddy sand surface formed a hard crust to reduce the wind erosion, but it also hindered the infiltration process that two gullies were found on the dune after a heavy rain. Sand fence should have an appropriate fence porosity to be effective.

AB  - Abstract. In recent years, lake eutrophication caused a large of Cyanobacteria bloom which not only brought serious ecological disaster but also restricted the sustainable development of regional economy in our country. Chlorophyll-a is a very important environmental factor to monitor water quality, especially for lake eutrophication. Remote sensed technique has been widely utilized in estimating the concentration of chlorophyll-a by different kind of vegetation indices and monitoring its distribution in lakes, rivers or along coastline. For each vegetation index, its quantitative estimation accuracy for different satellite data might change since there might be a discrepancy of spectral resolution and channel center between different satellites. The purpose this paper is to analyze the spectral feature of chlorophyll-a with hyperspectral data (totally 651 bands) and use the result to choose the optimal band combination for different satellites. The analysis method developed here in this study could be useful to recognize and monitor cyanobacteria bloom automatically and accrately. In our experiment, the reflectance (from 350nm to 1000nm) of wild cyanobacteria in different consistency (from 0 to 1362.11ug/L) and the corresponding chlorophyll-a concentration were measured simultaneously. Two kinds of hyperspectral vegetation indices were applied in this study: simple ratio (SR) and narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), both of which consists of any two bands in the entire 651 narrow bands. Then multivariate statistical analysis was used to construct the linear, power and exponential models. After analyzing the correlation between chlorophyll-a and single band reflectance, SR, NDVI respetively, the optimal spectral index for quantitative estimation of cyanobacteria chlorophyll-a, as well corresponding central wavelength and band width were extracted. Results show that: Under the condition of water disturbance, SR and NDVI are both suitable for quantitative estimation of chlorophyll-a, and more effective than the traditional single band model; the best regression models for SR, NDVI with chlorophyll-a are linear and power, respectively. Under the condition without water disturbance, the single band model works the best. For the SR index, there are two optimal band combinations, which is comprised of infrared (700nm-900nm) and blue-green range (450nm-550nm), infrared and red range (600nm-650nm) respectively, with band width between 45nm to 125nm. For NDVI, the optimal band combination includes the range from 750nm to 900nm and 700nm to 750nm, with band width less than 30nm. For single band model, band center located between 733nm-935nm, and its width mustn’t exceed the interval where band center located in. This study proved , as for SR or NDVI, the centers and widths are crucial factors for quantitative estimating chlorophyll-a. As for remote sensor, proper spectrum channel could not only improve the accuracy of recognizing cyanobacteria bloom, but reduce the redundancy of hyperspectral data. Those results will provide better reference for designing the suitable spectrum channel of customized sensors for cyanobacteria bloom monitoring at a low altitude. In other words, this study is also the basic research for developing the real-time remote sensing monitoring system with high time and high spatial resolution.

AB  - The objective of this study is to describe the methodology and key results of an assessment of the impacts of extreme wave events on Basque coast (Gipuzkoan coast) via flood risk maps. The risk of marine flooding during extreme events has been calculated along the coast, by combining the action from high sea level and waves and using numerical modeling. The extreme wave flood level was integrated with a high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (using airborne topographic LiDAR) to produce flood-risk maps. The impacts on land use and biological communities have also been assessed by overlaying the flood-risk maps with detailed coastal habitat classification. The results were compared to the impact expected from sea level rise by the end of the 21st century. In contrast, the areas expected to be impacted by sea level rise, are concentrated in protected low-lying areas especially within the inner estuaries (with terrestrial and artificial habitats being the most affected) and extend over 111 ha.

AB  - ABSTRACT The objective of this experiment was to assess the effectiveness of a new Type III chemical dispersant on stranded, lightly weathered crude oil and emulsified medium fuel oil (mousse). The oils were applied to field plots on contrasting sediment shorelines (salt marsh and sand flat), where both oils had been shown to be persistent. On the salt marsh, dispersant-treated oils usually were detected at lower sediment total hydrocarbon (THC) concentrations than were the untreated oils. However, clear trends were not visible until heavy rain removed the oiled, dead vegetation. Subsequently, the THC concentrations measured in the treated crude plots were reduced by half, and stable, lower concentrations were measured in the mousse plots. On the sand flat, the dispersant-treated mousse was detected at consistently lower THC concentrations than was the untreated mousse. The crude-oil-treated plots showed more temporal variability than the mousse-treated plots. Dispersant-treated crude ultimately was detected at half the concentration found in the untreated crude plots. Although on the salt marsh both dispersant-treated oils were more damaging in the short term to the plant community, the longer-term effects of higher untreated oil concentrations may prove more destabilizing to the salt-marsh habitat as a whole. After erosion, untreated oil may be resuspended to form oil slicks, when public interest in the original spill and the sense of responsibility for its cleanup have all but disappeared. Under the slightly higher-energy conditions of the sand flat, dispersant use did not dramatically alter the fate of most of the oil. The approximately 10% that remained in the beach was less obvious visually and was removed faster than the untreated oil. The practical implication of this is that if the cleanup authorities can resist amenity and conservationist pressures to disperse the residual oil, such tidal flats will eventually self-clean. Earlier formulations of chemical dispersant either have been relatively ineffective or have increased contamination on low-energy sediment shores. Several explanations may be advanced for the effectiveness of this dispersant on both oil types. First, it helped prevent the formation of surface oiled pavements and, thus, the burial of oil layers. Second, the contact time of oils and dispersant (>2 hours pre-tidal coverage) may have contributed to the reductions in oil concentrations. Third, at both sites there was sufficient energy input to assist dispersion.

AB  - More and more coastlines are changing into urban structures. This change is marked by the application of a wide variety of different materials as revetments, often creating a hard substrate. The realization of such substrates can have large consequences for the flora and fauna inhabiting the coastal areas. Elastocoast registered is such a new coastal protection material, made from rocks and polyurethane. It is a hard substrate but with an open structure and a smooth surface. This study examines the first phase of the recovery and growth of the algal community during the storm season of 2007-2008 on a dike in the Netherlands that was refurbished with Elastocoast registered , and it describes a short term algal colonization experiment in the laboratory. In the field, 25 weeks after the construction of the Elastocoast registered top layer, dike vegetation has returned, though strongly zonated and leaving large patches without any vegetation. Main algal species are Enteromorpha minima and Fucus spiralis. It is expected that the algal community will fully resemble typical hard substrate communities (as e.g. growing on basalt) when given enough time. The laboratory experiment showed that colonization by micro-algae is not hindered by the smooth surface and can be fast and substantial under favorable circumstances. Elastocoast registered therefore seems to be a material which allows algal community recovery to be fast and according to the typical vegetation growing on hard substrates.

AB  - Marine biological invasions have been regarded as one of the major causes of native biodiversity loss, with shipping and aquaculture being the leading contributors for the introductions of alien species in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, five aquatic alien species (one mollusk, three crustaceans and one fish spe- cies) were detected during dives, shore searches and from the fisheries on the coast of the Delta do Parnaiba Environmental Protection Area, in the States of Piaui and Maranhao, Northeastern Brazil. The species were the bicolor purse-oyster Isognomon bicolor, the whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the Indo-Pacific swimming crab Charybdis hellerii and, the muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus. Ballast water (I. bicolor, C. hellerii, and O. punctatus) and aquaculture activities (L. vannamei and M. rosenbergii) in adjacent areas are the most likely vectors of introduction. All exotic species found have potential impact risks to the environment because they are able to compete against native species for resources (food and habitat). Isognomon bicolor share the same habitat and food items with the native bivalve species of mussels and barnacles. Litopenaeus vannamei share the same habitat and food items with the native penaeids such as the pinkspot shrimp Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis, the Southern brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus subtilis, and the Southern white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti, and in the past few years L. vannamei was responsible for a viral epidemics in the cultivation tanks that could be transmitted to native penaeid shrimps. Charybdis hellerii is also able to cause impacts on the local fisheries as the species can decrease the populations of native portunid crabs which are commercialized in the studied region. Macrobrachium rosenbergii may be sharing natural resources with the Amazon River prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum. Omobranchus punctatus shares habit with the native redlip blenny Ophioblennius atlanticus and other fishes, such as the frillfin goby Bathigobius soporator. Some immediate remedial measures to prevent further introductions from ballast water and shrimp farm ponds should be: (i) to prevent the release of ballast water by ship/vessels in the region; (ii) to reroute all effluent waters from shrimp rearing facilities through an underground or above-ground dry well; (iii) to install adequate sand and gravel filter which will allow passage of water but not livestock; (iv) outdoor shrimp pounds located on floodable land should be diked, and; (v) to promote environmental awareness of those directly involved with ballast water (crews of ship/vessels) and shrimp farms in the region.

AB  - Soluble organic matter derived from exotic Pinus species has been shown to form stronger complexes with iron (Fe) than that derived from most native Australian species. It has also been proposed that the establishment of exotic Pinus plantations in coastal southeast Queensland may have enhanced the solubility of Fe in soils by increasing the amount of organically complexed Fe, but this remains inconclusive. In this study we test whether the concentration and speciation of Fe in soil water from Pinus plantations differs significantly from soil water from native vegetation areas. Both Fe redox speciation and the interaction between Fe and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were considered; Fe - DOM interaction was assessed using the Stockholm Humic Model. Iron concentrations (mainly Fe 2+) were greatest in the soil waters with the greatest DOM content collected from sandy podosols (Podzols), where they are largely controlled by redox potential. Iron concentrations were small in soil waters from clay and iron oxide-rich soils, in spite of similar redox potentials. This condition is related to stronger sorption on to the reactive clay and iron oxide mineral surfaces in these soils, which reduces the amount of DOM available for electron shuttling and microbial metabolism, restricting reductive dissolution of Fe. Vegetation type had no significant influence on the concentration and speciation of iron in soil waters, although DOM from Pinus sites had greater acidic functional group site densities than DOM from native vegetation sites. This is because Fe is mainly in the ferrous form, even in samples from the relatively well-drained podosols. However, modelling suggests that Pinus DOM can significantly increase the amount of truly dissolved ferric iron remaining in solution in oxic conditions. Therefore, the input of ferrous iron together with Pinus DOM to surface waters may reduce precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides (ferrihydrite) and increase the flux of dissolved Fe out of the catchment. Such inputs of iron are most probably derived from podosols planted with Pinus.

AB  - ABSTRACT A release of approximately 6,561 barrels of crude oil from a Texaco pipeline into Lake Barre in May 1997 injured marsh, birds, and aquatic fauna. Texaco was proactive in dealing with the trustees in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) process and stayed directly involved throughout; resulting in a cooperative assessment. The trustees focused quickly on the key injuries that required assessment. There was early agreement to conduct a cooperative, restoration-based NRDA, and to design field studies for the injured marsh to provide inputs for scaling using habitat equivalency analysis (HEA). It also was agreed that for this incident, field studies to assess bird and aquatic faunal injury would not be cost-effective or likely improve the accuracy of injury estimates. Although agreement on a common quantification approach for faunal injury was not reached, the two sides agreed on how much restoration was appropriate. The parties developed an extensive list of restoration alternatives, and although the trustees retained the final decision making authority, there were no significant disagreements on how various alternatives ranked according to restoration selection criteria. The selected project is planting saltmarsh vegetation on a platform of dredged material placed on East Timbalier Island by the Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) program. No CWPPRA funds were available for planting. In scaling the restoration, Texaco will only get credit for the ecological services provided by their planting above that which would occur in the absence of planting. Factors such as erosion rates expected with and without planting and the rate of natural colonization of marsh in the absence of planting were considered in the scaling calculations. The trustees and Texaco jointly briefed attorneys for both sides throughout the NRDA process, but were not active participants in meetings regarding technical matters. These briefings ensured a quick transition from the injury assessment and restoration project selection process to settlement negotiations. A consent decree was lodged with the court in September 1999. Texaco will implement the restoration and the monitoring plan, and pay all trustee assessment and restoration oversight costs as part of the settlement.

AB  - Three beach and spit systems have been studied in northern Galicia, along the northwest coast of Spain, within the regional context of sea level rise and coastal erosion. Each system forms part of an estuary's mouth complex within the inner part of the Ortigueira, Barqueiro, and Viveiro rias. Erosive processes along the coast have been characterised and been found to affect cliffs, beaches, and archaeological sites. To compare both long-term (decadal) and short-term (annual) erosion and accretion trends among estuaries, we analysed the morphodynamic characteristics, the degree of human occupancy, and the historical evolution of each system and monitored two profiles at each beach. Dynamic parameters - dimensionless fall velocity and relative tidal range - were calculated for the characterisation of beaches, and maritime climate data - significant wave height (Hs), peak period (Tp), wave fetch direction, and wave period were obtained, and wave height reduction was estimated for all estuaries. Detailed analysis of the three systems shows that, having originated under similar geomorphic and natural dynamic conditions, they have evolved in totally different ways: balance or slight accretion at Ortigueira, erosion at Barqueiro, and strong modification of dynamics at Viveiro. Anthropogenic activity has been identified as the most influential factor, particularly because structures were made without considering the dynamic characteristics of the natural environment in the sites studied.

AB  - Mangroves have long been known as the important ecosystem for being home to aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, as well as fisheries resources. It is also considered an efficient carbon pool in tropical regions such as Indonesia. However, recent developments in the coastal areas of Bengkulu City in Indonesia could potentially alter and erode mangrove functions, in particular, mangroves as a carbon sink. Previous studies on the role of mangrove forests concerning global warming in the area have not illustrated the distribution of biomass and carbon and its uncertainties. Hence, this study aimed to assess mangrove richness, biomass and carbon content to provide the current state and distribution and its role in climate change mitigation. Six sampling locations were determined reflecting area distribution and its status (conservation and non-conservation). A total of 60 nested quadrat plots were employed for the trees and saplings category. Above-and below-ground biomass was estimated by using the allometric model. The findings showed that a total of nine species were observed. The average biomass and carbon stocks were 302.27 t ha-1 and 135.02 t C ha-1, respectively, over seven-fold higher than the previous studies. Pantai Panjang station was the highest storing carbon at 235.95 t C ha-1, while the lowest was in Teluk Sepang (74.61 t C ha-1 ). These findings also suggest that non-protected mangrove forests also played a key role, similar to the conservation mangrove forests, regarding the climate change mitigation. It is, therefore, urgently required to enhance the strategy and program in order to maintain the current mangrove ecosystems within and beyond the conservation areas. © 2022, BIOFLUX SRL.

AB  - An extensive pore water data set has been gathered in the Great Marsh, Delaware over various seasons, salinities, and tides. The data all point to a complimentary redox cycle for sulfur and iron which operates seasonally and tidally. Surface oxidizing conditions prevail in summer, with more reducing conditions at depth during the winter. During the spring tides which flood the marsh, pyrite oxidation occurs releasing excess dissolved iron (II) and sulfate to the porewaters, and precipitating authigenic solid iron phases. The redox conditions in the porewaters of the upper zone during the summer is poised between mildly oxidizing and mildly reducing conditions as shown by pE calculations. This redox environment and intermediate iron-sulfur redox species may be important for the stimulation of plant growth (photosynthesis) and sustenance of a viable microbial community (heterotrophy and chemoautropy).

AB  - To characterize the distribution of nitrogen in the sediment of Taige south river estuary, column samples of sediments were collected and analyzed in April, 2012. Our results revealed that a synchronized trend existed among the levels of ammonium nitrogen (NH super(+) sub(4)-N), organic nitrogen (Org-N) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface layer of sediment. The NH super(+) sub(4)-N positively correlated with TN and Org-N significantly (P < 0.05) while TN highly significantly correlated with Org-N (P < 0.01). Org-N was the major form of nitrogen, comprising 93.38% of total nitrogen (TN) averagely. Both horizontal and vertical distribution of nitrogen in sediments apparently changed along the distance to stream outlet. In the horizontal dimension in sediments, Org-N and TN decreased progressively as forwarding into the lake in the extending direction of the main stream, while showed a "W"-type fluctuation in the diverged direction away from the main stream. The level of NH super(+) sub(4)-N decreased rapidly within 100 m to the stream outlet and remained constantly at a lower level beyond 100 m. However, the level of nitrate nitrogen (NO super(-) sub(3)-N) stabilized within 0-800 m and increased greatly beyond 800 m. In the vertical dimension in sediments, the level of NH super(+) sub(4)-N increased with increasing depth. As the distance to the stream outlet increasing, the enrichment of NO super(-) sub(3)-N was enhanced in surface layers rather than in lower subsurface layers. Alternatively, the enrichment of Org-N and TN were reduced in surface layers but enhanced in subsurface layers.

AB  - The impact of runoff from sulfuric soils in the heavily drained Cudgen Lake floodplain, eastern Australia on water quality and downstream coastal lake sediments has been examined. The oxidation of sulfidic soils and the transformation into sulfuric soils leads to changes not only in the upper soil profile but also affects drainage water quality and the chemistry of bottom sediments in receiving waters. Oxidation transforms the soil from a sink for sulfur and metals to a significant source for downstream environments. Sulfuric soils within the Cudgen Lake catchment contain 9.18 x 10(5) Mol H+ per hectare as well as elevated concentration of metals (e.g. Al, Fe, Mn) and sulfate. These products of sulfidic soil oxidation are transported efficiently from the soil profile by the constructed drainage network and into the downstream lake system. The acid volatile sulfur (AVS), chromium reducible sulfur (CRS), total sulfur, organic carbon, and reactive iron contents present in the solid phase of the lake sediments are reported. The AVS/CRS, DOP and DOS values observed in the lake sediments show that natural monosulfide formation in the near surface sediments has been enhanced due to increased inputs of organic matter, sulfate, ferrous iron and other metals following development of the catchment. There are elevated concentrations of metals (e.g. As, Al, Cd, Cr, Hg, Zn and Pb) in the upper layer of monsulfidic lake sediments compared with the underlying pyritic sediments some of which exceed sediment quality guidelines. These metals could be released by dredging or through re-suspension during high flow conditions or enter the food chain. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change of cities is currently becoming one of the key points in the planning processes. Adaptation contributes to preservation/improvement of the quality of life and human well-being. It should be an integral part of SMART Cities. Implementation of adaptation measures frequently faces numerous problems, including insufficient awareness of manifestations of climate change or importance of different measures. On an example of the urban district Brno-Novy Liskovec, the paper demonstrates possible approaches that play a supporting role in planning and implementation of adaptation measures. To promote further development of nature-based solutions, the paper presents an economic assessment of existing measures, including an assessment of their benefits. The results indicate that the implementation of a park with a wetland in the densely built-up area has brought high social benefits greatly exceeding the costs.

AB  - Baird harnessed the latest technology to improve the beach while minimizing environmental impacts and improving habitat wherever possible at a west coast location in Barbados. Baird used an Echoscope to precisely map bathymetry, living reef, and voids in relic reef. Following numerical and physical modeling, underwater structures for beach stabilization were specifically designed to accommodate coral transplants and lab grown corals. This first phase of shoreline stabilization creates new opportunities for enhancement, training, and education. Subsequent monitoring of biodiversity will measure the rate of reef recovery. Turbidity monitoring, as well as rainfall and surface run-off rates, will provide much needed information regarding the relative impacts of wave sediment resuspension and surface run-off on coral health.

AB  - High water levels on Lake Michigan during 1985 and 1986 created substantial erosion of the shoreline. Four coastal engineering projects were designed and constructed during this time. Artificial beach units stabilized by offshore breakwaters were used as the main component of each project. Physical hydraulic model studies were used to determine the orientation, size, and spacing of breakwaters and artificial beach units. Model predictions of beach profiles and plan shapes compare closely with prototype surveys. Surveys completed since construction demonstrate the stability of the beaches and support their use as effective, low maintenance shoreline protection.

AB  - Nine study sites of the reef crest along the entire length of a 15 km-long bank-barrier reef off the southeast coast of Barbados indicated that the surface is composed of mostly reworked fragments of Acropora palmata covered with macroalgae, crustose coralline algae and turf algae. Known as Cobbler's Reef, this feature had no live colonies of A. palmata at our study sites and supported only small scattered colonies of corals, mainly Diploria spp., Porites astreoides and the hydrocoral Millepora complanata. Eleven of 29 surface-sample radiocarbon dates plot above the western Atlantic sea-level curve between approximately 3,300 to 4,500 cal yrs (calibrated, calendar 14C years) ago. This suggests that the reef complex was extensively damaged by a series of severe storms during this period. A reduced number of in situ framework dates follow that period and plot at acceptable depths of growth below this sea-level curve. The most recent dates are 320 and 400 cal yrs old. The lack of coral framework recovery and final demise of this reef are probably related to a number of disturbances. Although white-band disease, bleaching, and recruitment limitations could have played a role, a lack of herbivory in this area of constant heavy wave action probably allowed heavy algal growth that prevented the re-establishment of a vigorous coral reef following the period of severe storm activity. Finally, the turbidity associated with the clearing of land for sugarcane agriculture in the mid-1600s likely killed the last of the sediment-sensitive A. palmata on Cobbler's Reef. The more recent almost complete loss of A. palmata from other reefs off Barbados is probably related to storm damage and nutrient runoff and construction associated with tourism development. This is an expanded report of an earlier publication of this study, with descriptions of sampling sites and documentation of the demise of A. palmata island wide.

AB  - Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus) is an invasive aquatic plant introduced to North America from Eurasia in 1897. Flowering rush can grow either submersed or emergent from wet soil habitats to waters that are up to 5 m deep. Flowering rush was first observed in the Detroit Lake system in the 1960s, causing significant impact to shoreline and recreational use. Flowering rush is currently found in five basins of the Detroit Lake system: Big Detroit, Little Detroit, Curfman, Sallie, and Melissa Lakes. Submersed treatments with diquat were used during 2012 on an operational scale to control the nuisance impacts of flowering rush in waters from 0 to 1.3 m deep. We evaluated the response of native plant communities with the use of a point intercept method on 30 or more predetermined points in each of nine treatment plots, with four untreated reference plots. Treatment plots were sampled before treatment (June), and 4 wk after each of the two treatments. We also sampled 20 biomass cores (0.018 m(-2)) in each of four treatment and four untreated reference plots. Although some species declined after treatment, most native species did not change significantly after treatments compared to untreated reference plots. Treatments with diquat not only significantly reduce flowering rush distribution (60%) and aboveground biomass (99%), but also significantly reduced belowground biomass (82%) and rhizome bud density (83%). As flowering rush is an herbaceous perennial that propagates predominantly by rhizome buds, reductions in rhizome bud density indicate that this approach can be used for long-term reduction in flowering rush populations.

AB  - Urban wetlands are continuously being exploited by human activities and natural disasters. Many of these degraded wetlands have been converted to natural assets by Green-Blue interventions for resilience and sustainability. Use of appropriate natural systems and soft landscape as per the contextual demand are widely practiced and tested design principles to achieve resilience. Incorporating these principles in parks and promenade are being popular as green intervention for protection, conservation and management of such valuable wetlands. Through extensive case studies, an attempt is made to review successful water front developments and identified suitable nature based solutions for design development of wetland parks and their adaptability in urban infrastructure planning.

AB  - Risks: The 26 km long international stretch of the Alpine Rhine River between the confluence of the River 111 and the estuary into Lake Constance was canalised at the end of the 19th as well as at the beginning of the 20th century in order to alleviate the problems caused by severe major floods in the preceding years. The river alterations enabled an economic as well as an agricultural boom in the lower Rhine River valley. Today approx. 300'000 people live and work within this region due to the rectification work by the International Rhine Regulation IRR. Within the last decades the geotechnical as well as the safety standards have changed along with ecological restoration issues. Due to the significant increase of urban areas, the potential risk and vulnerability have increased tremendously. Flood control as a main goal: The main objective for the Alpine Rhine Project is an improvement of the current flood protection system. The design discharge of the project is 4'300 m 3/s (equivalent to a 300-year flood), while also taking into account an extreme event of 5'800 m3/s. In order to achieve this goal, heavy construction measures with new levees and widening of the existing riverbed are necessary. All measures must fulfil today's requirements of both neighbouring countries Austria and Switzerland. This includes an improvement of the ecological situation, the preservation of the existing drinking water supply and a minimal impact on the environment during construction. Ecology and flood protection-a double win: According to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) the lower stretch of the Alpine Rhine River is considered to be "heavily modified". In order to fulfil the WFD the river needs to be ecologically restored. According to the Swiss Water Protection Act the natural river state must be achieved as far as possible. However, all parties involved agree that the original historic morphology of the Rhine River can never be fully restored. Therefore the main goal of the project is to allow as much lateral river widening as feasible. A wider cross section of the Alpine Rhine River allows both ecological restoration and the required flood protection level. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

AB  - Forelands are an important part of the coastal protection system at the German coast because they significantly reduce the wave load on the dike, i.e. on the main protection element. The effectiveness of forelands in wave damping was analysed using transmission coefficient for a site at the coast of SchleswickHolstein, Germany, on the basis of field measurements, numerical modelling with SWAN and additional physical model tests in the large wave flume GWK of the University of Hannover, Germany. Besides of the influence the ratio of water depth and wave height the transmission coefficients strongly depend on the width of the foreland. With a width of more than 325 m the foreland provides maximum damping of the incoming wave field.

AB  - Throughout the world, critically eroded shorelines pose a myriad of social and environmental concerns. As an increase in natural geologic and climatic events (e.g., coastal earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, weathering) occur to facilitate erosion of the Earth's coasts, shore protection becomes critically important as a preventative measure against catastrophic environmental and socio-economic damage. However, as more and more offshore sand resources are either used up or contaminated with pollutants (e.g., crude oil sub-buoyant plumes settling at the benthic interface), there is an imperative effort to explore alternatives to more traditional sand sources. One alternative involves the use of recycled glass cullet as coastal beach fill in erosional 'hot-spots'. The cullet is obtained by processing any type of glass product (e.g., bottles, containers, tanks, etc.) in such a way that it will closely match the grain size of the current native beach sediments. This specific type of recycled processing has been successful in adequately matching natural said grains. However, before the recycled glass can be directly applied to the shoreline, a series of analyses had to occur in order to determine the suitability of the cullet for a natural beach environment. This paper is a concise review of the geotechnical, biological, and abiotic analyses conducted on the recycled glass cullet for coastal protection.

AB  - The 67 km long Belgian North Sea Coast is a recent sand-barrier coast, consisting of a narrow dune and beach belt, which is the primary natural defence system against flooding of the 200.000 ha of coastal-plain lowlands, commonly called the "polders". For about a century both waterfront and polder- lowlands knew an intensive urban and resort development, combined with hard coastal defence structures and protruding seadikes, turning it into a "squeezed coast" with little or no space left for any ecological, economical or residential developments anymore. Moreover, a large part of all 240 coastal sections are subject to structural erosions of beach and dune systems resulting in an insufficient flood protection against extreme storm-events. In the same period, it appeared that the old-tech "hard coastal protection systems"-seawalls, groynes and revetments-have proved a poor efficiency, if any, in achieving a sound coastal protection, being unable to deliver safety against flooding. Moreover, these cannot be considered as sustainable anymore, because they don't cure the cause and are not capable to integrate the unknowns about future climate change and sea-level rise. The main cause of the poor sedimentological health of the beach and dune barrier in the erosive sections seems to be a chronic shortage of sand in the system. This shortage of sand causes the seaward-slope to progressively steepen, and prevents the free play of the coastal morpho-dynamics which provides the resilience for coastal protection. Protruding seawalls and shrinking sand-reserves in the system result in a "squeezed coast". In the early 90-ies, a first "morphological beach and dune restoration "was executed, which proved to be a costefficient and sustainable solution for the 10km long coastal stretch centred around De Haan. This large full-scale coastal protection scheme-unique in its kind-inspired the concept for a safe and streamlined coastline as part of the vision -plan 'Flanders Bays': it integrates various functions of the beach, including extreme storm-event response and resilience, touristic beach developments, drink and food facilities, ecosystem functions, eventfacilities,... etc. The engineering design of these "smart beach and dune nourishments" is based on the observation of natural morpho-dynamics and achieved reclamations and by replicating these natural processes: a replica of the beach morphology and the natural beach sand. Basically a "smart beach and dune nourishment" consists of: A "shore-face nourishment" with which the LW-breaker bar is reclaimed in order to tackle any further steepening of the sub-tidal beach and the sand-demand of the submerged part of the beach; the selected sand-granulometry for reclamation is compliant with the original sand of the Low Water -breaker bar; A "profile nourishment" of the tidal beach between Chart Datum + 1m and Chart Datum + 5m, in which the sand is profiled in compliance with the anticipated equilibrium slope of the beach in order to minimise resuspension and subsequent losses due to tidal and wave-induced currents; the selected sand -granulometry for reclamation is compliant with the original beach-sand; A wide "upper-beach platform" at CD + 8m, above storm-surge level, prevents any form of whitewater or blue-water wave-overtopping, providing a buffer for extreme storm-event flash-erosions and a platform for various beach developments Flexible and removable wind-screens on the supra-tidal beach in order to capture/fix the eolian sand during the winter months. "Smart beach and dune nourishments" are presented here: as such, these were integrated in the proposed visionplan "Flanders Bays" for long-term, opportunity-building and sustainable coastal protection via a streamlined and dynamic coastline. "Flanders Bays" has been integrated in the Flemish Governmental Plan in 2011.

AB  - This coastal region of North and South Carolina is a gently sloping plain, containing large riverine estuaries, sounds, lagoons, and salt marshes. The most striking feature is the large, enclosed sound known as the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System, covering approximately 7530 km2. The coast also has numerous tidal creek estuaries ranging from 1 to 10 km in length. This coast has a rapidly growing population and greatly increasing point and nonpoint sources of pollution. Agriculture is important to the region, swine rearing most notably increasing fourfold during the 1990s. Estuarine phytoplankton communities in North Carolina are well studied; the most important taxonomic groups are diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, and cyanobacteria. Several major poorly flushed estuaries are eutrophic due to nutrient inputs, and toxic dinoflagellates (Pfiesteria spp.) may reach high densities in nutrient-enriched areas. Fully marine waters are relatively oligotrophic. Southern species enter in subsurface intrusions, eddies, and occasional Gulf Stream rings, while cool water species enter with the flow of the Labrador Current to the Cape Hatteras region. The Carolinas have a low number of endemic macroalgae, but species diversity can be high in this transitional area, which represents the southermost extension for some cold-adapted species and the northernmost extension of warm-adapted species. In North Carolina the dominant seagrass, Zostera marina, lies at its southernmost extension, while a second species, Halodule wrightii is at its northermost extent. Widgeon-grass Ruppia maritima is common, growing in brackish water or low-salinity pools in salt marshes. Seagrasses are now much reduced, probably due to elevated nitrogen and increased sedimentation. In sounds, numerically dominant benthic taxa include bivalves, polychaetes and amphipods, many showing gradients in community type from mesohaline areas of the eastern shore to near marine salinities in western parts. The semi-enclosed sounds have extensive shellfisheries, especially of blue crab, northern quahogs, eastern oysters, and shrimp. Problems include contamination of some sediments with toxic substances, especially of metals and PCBs at sufficiently high levels to depress growth of some benthic macroinvertebrates. Numerous fish kills have been caused by toxic dinoflagellate outbreaks, and fish kills and habitat loss have been caused by episodic hypoxia and anoxia in rivers and estuaries. Oyster beds currently are in decline because of overharvesting, high siltation and suspended particulate loads, disease, and coastal development. Fisheries monitoring which began in the late 1970s shows greatest recorded landings in 1978-1982; since then, harvests have declined by about a half. Some management plans have been developed toward improving water quality and fisheries sustainability. Major challenges include; high coliform levels leading to closures of shellfish beds, a problem that has increased with urban development and increasing cover of watershed by impervious surfaces; high by-catch and heavy trawling activity; overfishing which has led to serious declines in many wild fish stocks; and eutrophication. Comprehensive plans limiting nutrient inputs are needed for all coastal rivers and estuaries, not only those that already exhibit problems. There is a critical need to improve management of nonpoint nutrient runoff, through increased use of streamside vegetated buffers, preservation of remaining natural wetlands, and construction of artificial wetlands. Improved treatment processes, based on strong incentive programs, should also be mandated for present and future industrial-scale animal operations.

AB  - The accurate and precise mapping of Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) plays a key role in the management of a region. In particular the knowledge of areas close to rivers and / or estuaries is fundamental to prevent flooding preserving the integrity of artificial structures and natural flora and fauna. Actually the mapping is performed by processing remote sensed data with a typical GSD of 0.5m. The survey is expensive and the presence of clouds could invalidate an entire survey. This kind of survey is perfect for a monitoring over a long period while is not appropriate for a quasi real time imagery. The adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a proper solution owing to the low cost and the reduced time for the setup, but it lacks of a complete view of the area. The reason is the presence of canopy that occludes the view. We integrate the images acquired by an UAV characterized by a GSD of 0.03m with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that collects images of the river from different point of view enhanced by an RGB-D sensor. The change detection algorithm applied to the collected data is based on a innovative hybrid classifier that fuses the benefit of pixel and object based approaches mapping the changes over a well defined temporal horizon.

AB  - The paper discusses the problems associated with the loss of coastal resources, which is often the result of applying traditional coast protection measures in densely developed areas. It is recommended to distinguish clearly between coast protection, as measures mainly securing the coastline, and shore protection, as measures protecting also the shore and the natural coastal resources. The planning concepts Shoreline Management Planning and Management Unit Master Planning have been discussed, in which connection the importance of obtaining broad consensus for a management strategy and for cost sharing has been highlighted. The importance of preserving the coastal resources by working with the nature has been illustrated and innovative shoreline protection principles have been proposed for different types of coastal classifications. New types of environmentally optimized coastal structures have been proposed and an overall comparison of various protection measures has been made.

AB  - Mano, A., IIda, T., Udo, K., and Tanaka. H., 2013. Breaking process and mechanism of coastal levees on Sendai Bay Coast hit by 2011 mega tsunami The 2011 mega tsunami induced by the East Japan Earthquake, Mw 9.0 hit the Sendai Bay Coast, overtopped the coastal levees and intruded deeply onto the Sendai and Ishinomaki plains by flushing people, houses, trees, etc. The levees with 6 to 7 m height had been constructed along 65 km-long sandy beach to protect the hinterland from the storm surges and wind waves. Eighty percent of the levees were broken by the tsunami in various degrees ranging from scatter of the surface blocks to the complete disappearance. The government decided to rebuild the levees with the target of the local major hazards as the storm surges but in a durable way even for the tsunami overtopping. Based on this background, this study aims to find the breaking process and mechanism of the coastal levees especially for the destructive cases. We conducted field survey, and collected aerial photos, tsunami records and videos, blue prints of the levees, etc. We integrated information of the tsunami records and videos, and matched the spatial information of the various data by GIS. These analyses enabled well understanding on the breaking process and mechanisms composed from two steps: (1) The impact of the leading bore with the maximum amplitude of 6 to 7m broke weaker parts like structural joints, parapets, landward soil slopes. (2) Return flow concentration to the broken parts in the first step or to the channels and swamps expanded erosion to make tsunami channels and bays and to lead levee breach.

AB  - The role of wetland on water quality of rivers was estimated in a natural lake, Grand-Lieu (5600 ha), discharging to the Loire estuary. Inputs of its two tributaries, budgets and retention within the lake for particulate matter (PM), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were compared during the inflow period (Oct–May), by an input-output study, in two hydrologically contrasted years, 1993–94 with high inflow (292 106 m3), and 1995–96 with low inflow (76 106 m3). Globally the loads per ha were similar for the two tributaries for the same year, with higher values at the beginning of the flows, and total inputs markedly higher in 1993–94. During this year, average loads for the main tributary were 154 kg ha-1 PM, 40 kg ha-1 total N and 1.35 kg ha-1 total P. In the two tributaries, NO3 represented 80% of total N for the two years, and PO4 65% and 44% of total P. Total inputs, total outputs and storages are highly related to annual inflow, with large differences between elements. The highest change of inputs occur for NO2, PO4 and PM, and the lowest for NH4. Storage and outputs of the lake were also much higher in 1993–94, the most important annual differences concerning P storage, and outputs of PM and all forms of nitrogen except NH4. However, only the retention rate of total P doubled with the high outflow of 1993–94 (40% against 18%), while those of PO4 and NH4 were equivalent (79–72% and 72–66% respectively). In contrast the retention rate of all the other elements was lower with the large flow of 1993–94: 61 against 86% for NO3, 85–90% for NO2, 32–60% for total N, and 14–20% for PM. Globally, this wetland received important discharge of inorganic nitrogen from its catchment area, trapping or converting most of it (62–85%) into organic matter, while it exported a large amount of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen (16 g m-2 y-1 in 1993–94 and 4.5 in 1995–96), 2.6 and 1.9 times more than it received. The exportation of organic N per m2 and retention of total N (9.9–14.5 g m-2 y-1) represent record values. This seems mainly due to the importance of water flow, juxtaposition of habitats with different degree of closure, plant biomass and resuspended endogenous, organic sediments in exportation. The lake is not able to counterbalance the dramatic increase of agricultural and sewage inputs, that induce its eutrophication and silting up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Larval source management (LSM) may help reduce Plasmodium parasite transmission in malaria-endemic areas. LSM approaches include habitat modification (permanently or temporarily reducing mosquito breeding aquatic habitats); habitat manipulation (temporary or recurrent change to environment); or use of chemical (e.g. larviciding) or biological agents (e.g. natural predators) to breeding sites. We examined the effectiveness of habitat modification or manipulation (or both), with and without larviciding. This is an update of a review published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: 1. To describe and summarize the interventions on mosquito aquatic habitat modification or mosquito aquatic habitat manipulation, or both, on malaria control. 2. To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of mosquito aquatic habitat modification or mosquito aquatic habitat manipulation, or both, on malaria control. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was from January 2012 to 30 November 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non-randomized intervention studies comparing mosquito aquatic habitat modification or manipulation (or both) to no treatment or another active intervention. We also included uncontrolled before-after (BA) studies, but only described and summarized the interventions from studies with these designs. Primary outcomes were clinical malaria incidence, malaria parasite prevalence, and malaria parasitaemia incidence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized intervention studies. We used a narrative synthesis approach to systematically describe and summarize all the interventions included within the review, categorized by the type of intervention (habitat modification, habitat manipulation, combination of habitat modification and manipulation). Our primary outcomes were 1. clinical malaria incidence; 2. malaria parasite prevalence; and 3. malaria parasitaemia incidence. Our secondary outcomes were 1. incidence of severe malaria; 2. anaemia prevalence; 3. mean haemoglobin levels; 4. mortality rate due to malaria; 5. hospital admissions for malaria; 6. density of immature mosquitoes; 7. density of adult mosquitoes; 8. sporozoite rate; 9. entomological inoculation rate; and 10. HARMS: We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each type of intervention. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Six used an RCT design, six used a controlled before-after (CBA) study design, three used a non-randomized controlled design, and one used an uncontrolled BA study design. Eleven studies were conducted in Africa and five in Asia. Five studies reported epidemiological outcomes and 15 studies reported entomological outcomes. None of the included studies reported on the environmental impacts associated with the intervention. For risk of bias, all trials had some concerns and other designs ranging from moderate to critical. Ten studies assessed habitat manipulation (temporary change to the environment). This included water management (spillways across streams; floodgates; intermittent flooding; different drawdown rates of water; different flooding and draining regimens), shading management (shading of drainage channels with different plants), other/combined management approaches (minimal tillage; disturbance of aquatic habitats with grass clearing and water replenishment), which showed mixed results for entomological outcomes. Spillways across streams, faster drawdown rates of water, shading drainage canals with Napier grass, and using minimal tillage may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes (range of effects from 95% reduction to 1.7 times increase; low-certainty evidence), and spillways across streams may reduce densities of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (low-certainty evidence). However, the effect of habitat manipulation on malaria parasite prevalence and clinical malaria inci ence is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies assessed habitat manipulation with larviciding. This included reducing or removal of habitat sites; and drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs. It is uncertain whether drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs reduces malaria parasite prevalence compared to no intervention (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.83; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies assessed combination of habitat manipulation and permanent change (habitat modification). This included drainage canals, filling, and planting of papyrus and other reeds for shading near dams; and drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches. Studies did not report on epidemiological outcomes, but entomological outcomes suggest that such activities may reduce the density of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (relative risk reduction 0.49, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.50; low-certainty evidence), and preventing water stagnating using drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes compared to no intervention (ranged from 10% to 55% reductions; low-certainty evidence). Three studies assessed combining manipulation and modification with larviciding. This included filling or drainage of water bodies; filling, draining, or elimination of rain pools and puddles at water supply points and stream bed pools; and shoreline work, improvement and maintenance to drainage, clearing vegetation and undergrowth, and filling pools. There were mixed effect sizes for the reduction of entomological outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence). However, filling or draining water bodies probably makes little or no difference to malaria parasite prevalence, haemoglobin levels, or entomological inoculation rate when delivered with larviciding compared to no intervention (moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Habitat modification and manipulation interventions for preventing malaria has some indication of benefit in both epidemiological and entomological outcomes. While the data are quite mixed and further studies could help improve the knowledge base, these varied approaches may be useful in some circumstances.

AB  - ABSTRACT Martin-Prieto J.A., Roig-Munar, F.X., Pons G.X., Rodriguez-Perea A., Alvarado, M. and Mir-Gual M. 2013. Description of erosion processes in Spratt Bight (San Andres Island, Colombia) using Sequential End Point Rates (EPR). San Andres is a coral island located in the Colombian Caribbean, 700 km northwest of the main land. Twelve kilometers in length and three kilometers in width, it is one of the most populated islands with 2.612 inhabitants per square kilometer. Its economy is based on tourism. Despite being protected from storms and hurricanes by a chain of reefs that stretches across the north and east of the island, beaches suffer significant erosion. Spratt Bight is the biggest and the most important beach of the island. Temporal evolution of Spratt Bight was analyzed and the End Point Rate for several periods (from the year 1984 to 2010) has been calculated. Although beach nourishment between 1984 and 1990, erosive processes are dominant all over the beach. Erosion rates reach up to 35 m wit...

AB  - Two mangrove sites in the tropical island of Catanduanes in Bicol Region, Philippines (Lat.13.5 degree -14.17 degree N and Long. 124.1 degree -125.5 degree E) are described here using a paradigm for mangrove habitat restoration of mangroves that considers anthropogenic degradation and restoration following natural disturbances within the concept of climate change solution initiatives. What remains unclear for restoring the mangroves in this island are the needed (a) specific tools for land and sea-use zoning as well as integrated coastal management and ecosystembased management concepts; (b) information [e.g. existing stressors or resistant areas] on managing mangroves for resilience to climate change; and (c) designs and ways on how to present these climate programs to the local coastal dwelling communities vis a vis sea level rise, typhoons, tidal or storm surges and tsunamis. Obstacles encountered by the local people are the (a) inappropriate political intervention at the municipal/provincial levels; (b) lack of knowledge, expertise and baseline data about the biophysical conditions of the mangrove areas; and (c) differing and diverse intents on the mangrove resources leading to communication gaps. Climate biology studies assessing plant and animal responses to the effects of changes in typhoon patterns are needed. Finally, mangrove restoration programmes may use the Vulnerability and Adaptation (V & A) approach and address the notion that highly vulnerable coastal villages must evolve within the notion of "coastal management as a basic service of local government".

AB  - Mangrove forest conservation, rehabilitation and restoration (or ‘mangrovization’ as used in this paper) is practiced throughout the island province of Catanduanes in Luzon, Philippines to halt deforestation and degradation of coastal ecosystem and biodiversity. This study critically assesses mangrovization practices within the discourses on mangrove destruction and rehabilitation practices in this island using the lens of political ecology and Moscovici’s theory of social representations emphasizing institutional arrangements and the community dynamics. Analysis was based on interviews with 61 respondents from four municipalities of Virac, San Andres, Caramoran and Baras having intact mangroves covered in the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) – National Agriculture and Fisheries Extension System (NAFES) funded program SURMABIOCON of the Catanduanes State University (CSU). A huge majority of the population in the island live along the low elevation coastal zone and are experiencing and exposed to the effects of climate change and disasters as shown in typhoon occurrence, windiness, landslide, and tidal surges. The coasts of Catanduanes are predominantly shaped coastal changes, mangrove flora and beach forest vegetation which together provide protection against coastal erosion and trap sediments resulting in coastal accretion. Results of the study shows how formal and informal institutions created by both distinct stakeholder relations can lead to some success in mangrovization. There appears to be overlapping situations and inconsistencies in the implementation of science-based and community-based mangrovization programs in support of the overall coastal resource management (CRM) as outlined in local governance. Then need for state universities to be involved in mangrovization programs/projects/activities which center on decision-making power regarding science-based and community-based initiatives on how, where, and when mangrovization should be carried out, specifically on the location of replanting or restoring mangroves in the island. The strong LGU-community-academe institutional arrangement in the island provides better contribution to the success of mangrovization. Contemporary narratives from two progressive mangrovization projects having collaboration, cooperation, and monitoring schemes with the state university is central to the notion that these projects could lead to successes. The study demonstrates how weak stakeholders can become stronger in the implementation of mangrovization initiatives that begins with capacity building and strengthening academe-mangrove association partnerships thus leading to effective coastal governance, particularly on mangrove biodiversity conservation and mangrove rehabilitation and restoration in this island of Catanduanes. © 2021, BIOFLUX SRL.

AB  - Major parts of agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid regions of India are affected by soil salinity and waterlogging in canal command area and outside. Waterlogging is caused by a rising water table and poor drainage conditions.  Stress due to waterlogging and salinity are serious to plants in all stages from seed germination to active growth and maturity. Unmanaged affected agricultural lands turn into low productive marshlands in the long run. Physical provision of surface or sub-surface drainage structures can rescue in such a situation. Yet, high skill and investment are required in the installation and maintenance of such structures. Alternatively, biodrainage method has been evolved as an effective method recently world over. In biodrainage, plants are raised over a larger area, which can transpire and remove an enormous amount of water from the soil. Plants having adequate adaptive traits and tolerance mechanisms are desirable to mitigate waterlogging and salinity. Biodrainage is suitable in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Planting of right plant species in optimum population and geometry decides the efficiency of biodrainage. Further, combining biodrainage with the conventional drainage can improve land and water productivity. Eucalyptus is the most suitable tree species for biodrainage as it has well performed in versatile environments. It possesses appreciable tolerance to salinity, sodicity and waterlogged conditions of the soil.  Fast-growing with a straight trunk, deep rooting ability, low shading effect and high transpiration capacity are promising characteristics of this tree.  Prominent woody species like Acacia nilotica, Dalbergia sissoo, Hardwickia binata can also be grown for high profit.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE Charleston Conference Start Date: 2018, Oct. 22 Conference End Date: 2018, Oct. 25 Conference Location: Charleston, SC, USA This paper is focused on topic of exploration structural health monitoring which serve for several purposes. However, optimization of design and construction of MFARs considering civil and environmental engineering means is poorly investigated. The aim of this paper is to describe define structural monitoring capabilities which were implemented to creation of Multifunctional artificial reefs (MFAR). Prospective reef will be capable to perform as a potential tool for marine biodiversity restoration and rehabilitation, coastal protection to prevent erosion of a shore line and a scientific platform with various sensors able to self-monitoring and sensing ambient environment. Main efforts have been dedicated to review of existing state of the art on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods for offshore systems and computations of fluid-structure interaction to validate possible approaches. Suggestions in optimization of future sensors integration for monitoring structural health and environmental variables have been provided based on data from state of the art and simulation results. Delivered artificial reef design will serve as a base for future manufacturing of the artificial reef modules to help provide insight in how human-made construction may affect marine and coastal ecosystems.

AB  - For two centuries the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (CE) has been developing high-performance concretes. In the 1840s, various Corps of Engineers’ officers, including Robert E. Lee, developed concretes that could be placed underwater for construction of coastal defense facilities. General Q. A. Gillmore, whose device for measuring time of setting of cement paste is still used, published a book in 1863 on hydraulic cement and mortar. In 1871, he published a book on concrete, which introduced concrete technology from France that was significantly higher-performance than that then used in the United States. Contemporary development of high-performance concrete began in 1935 at the CE Concrete Laboratory at Eastport, Maine, in support of the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power project. The objective was to develop concrete able to resist twice daily immersion in sea water and freezing in the winter when the tide went out. That objective was achieved. In 1970, when confronted with the problem of severe abrasion-erosion damage in stilling basins below dams, a solution was found in the development of concretes having strengths greater than 100 MPa. This was done using silica fume and high-range water-reducing admixtures. Similar and higher-strength high-performance concretes have also been developed for defense purposes as part of the protective-structures portion of the U.S. military research and development (R&D) program. When stronger concrete or concrete that must resist a more severe exposure is needed, the Corps of Engineers’ concrete R&D capability has been able to develop it, and I expect it will continue to be able to do so. ©American Concrete Institute.

AB  - Submerged breakwaters are one of the most fundamental structures to protect coastal areas from wave action. To ensure the stability of a whole structure, it is primarily important to determine the required mass of armor units accurately. This study aims to evaluate the armor block stability based on a flow field calculated by a numerical wave flume. The flow field was calculated by using a 2D VOF-type numerical wave flume. The wave force acting on an armor block was calculated using the Morison formula. Drag, inertia and lift coefficients for the Morison formula were determined by using an exact 3D VOF-type numerical model. The resultant stability of the armor block was judged from a comparison between the wave force and the stabilizing force originating from the mass of the armor block. An evaluation method for the critical condition of armor block stability of submerged breakwaters is proposed. Parameters for the evaluation were calibrated through comparisons between experimental and numerical results. An impact wave force with short duration acted when the water depth above the breakwater was shallow. In such a situation, even if the peak value was large, the impulse was not so large. To estimate the displacement of the block, the equation of the motion of the block was solved. The agreement between predicted and experimental stability was improved by using the fluid force coefficient corresponding to an individual water depth condition. That is to say, the applicability of the model was shown to have improved.

AB  - ABSTRACT On September 27, 1996, the T/V JULIE N inbound with a cargo of 8.8 million gallons of #2 fuel oil struck the Million Dollar Bridge, spanning Portland Harbor between Portland and South Portland, Maine. The incident resulted in a spill of approximately 180,000 gallons of oil, which spread throughout a large area of Portland Harbor. The marine and coastal resources of Portland Harbor and the Fore River, including water resources, shellfish, wetlands, sediments, and birds were exposed and/or injured by the oil. The spill also had an adverse impact on several different public use services. The natural resource trustee agencies (including the State of Maine, NOAA, and the Department of the Interior) and Amity Products Carriers, Inc. (Responsible Party, RP) conducted a cooperative natural resource damage assessment to assess and restore natural resources exposed and/or injured by the spill. The trustees and RP operated under an initial verbal agreement to cooperate until a written agreement was executed over a year after the incident. The cooperative process and lessons learned are described in the paper. Particularly positive components included cooperative data collection and active collaboration on study design and endpoints. The trustees expended $782,860 in assessment costs. The RP expended an additional $169,101 in cooperative laboratory and field investigations, as well as $364,720 in consultant costs. The total assessment costs were $1,316,681. The trustees and the RP were then able to successfully negotiate a $1 million dollar settlement for the purpose of planning, implementing, and overseeing selected restoration projects. These projects included reducing the discharge of PAH's into the Fore River, wetland and bird habitat restoration, and construction of a recreational trail along the Fore River. The RP sought compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund under the limitation of liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Compensation included expenses beyond statutory liability for response, NRDA assessment, and damages to natural resources among others.

AB  - ABSTRACT In 1993, an incident involving three vessels near the entrance to Tampa Bay, near St. Petersburg, Florida, resulted in a discharge approximately 300,000 gallons of No. 6. fuel oil into the waters off Egmont Key. The oil contacted the shores from Egmont Key to locations approximately 14 miles to the north. Oil also entered Boca Ciega Bay through John's Pass and impacted four small islands that supported mature overwash mangrove forest. A cooperative damage assessment process was developed between the Responsible Parties (RPs) and the trustees for the natural resources: the state of Florida, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Through the cooperative process, several alternatives for primary and compensatory restoration were developed. In considering alternatives to compensate for impacts to epibenthic communities, fish and bird habitats, wetlands, and mangrove communities, the trustees and the RPs considered purchase of shoreline habitat and restoration of mangrove forest at several sites. The RP developed a proposal to purchase and deed into public ownership in perpetuity, a 10.67-acre parcel of land on the west bank of Cross Bayou in Boca Ciega Bay that had been used as a disposal site for dredge spoil in the past. This site consisted of approximately 5.0 acres of uplands, 4.4 acres of mangrove forest, and 1.4 acres of nonmangrove intertidal and subtidal habitat. The objective of the project was to establish a typical Tampa Bay mangrove forest and a roadside buffer free of exotic plant species. The secondary goals were to establish a typical Tampa Bay salt marsh dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina spp.) as a successional precursor to mangrove recruitment by seeds and seedlings. Tidal exchange through the site was reestablished to improve water quality and increase export of mangrove detritus and import of high-quality tidal waters. The project was designed and constructed by the RPs with the approval and supervision of the trustees. The project was completed and title transferred to Pinellas County, Florida in summer 1999. A monitoring program was developed and performance criteria established by trustee representatives and the RPs. The monitoring program currently is being conducted and has met performance criteria to date. This project demonstrates the positive result of trustees and the RPs working together to provide compensation to the environment.

AB  - Cootes Paradise is a coastal wetland, adjacent to Hamilton Harbour at the western tip of Lake Ontario. The marsh has been considerably degraded due to the excessive sediment and nutrient input from sewage treatment plants (STPs), marsh tributaries and Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs). Although there has been reduction in nutrient loadings from external sources, high nutrient levels, and a prolific algal growth remain a problem in Cootes Paradise. To assess the importance of external versus internal nutrient loadings to the marsh, nutrient fluxes from sediments were estimated using porewater profiles at three locations from 2001 and five additional sites from 2002. The fluxes varied between 0.27 and 5.25 mg P m-2 day-1, with sites receiving outfalls of STP and CSO having highest fluxes (∼5mg Pm-2day-1). Mean phosphorus release rate of 2.02 mg P m-2 day-1 was calculated from the spatial distribution of the non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAI-P) in sediments, employing a relationship between the NAI-P and P fluxes. The results confirm that sediment P geochemistry is important in regulating the P pool in porewater which, consequently, governs the P fluxes from sediments. © 2006 Springer.

AB  - Mangrove forests exist in intertidal areas of tropical zones and most are characterized by their complex root systems, which attenuates flow energy. Among the mangrove species, Rhizophora species is the most common one, representing approximately 90% of the world mangrove distribution (Ohira et al., 2013). In addition, this species is used in the majority of restoration projects. Rhizophora plants are characterized by their aerial roots, which form a network above the substrate. Although several studies have been performed in the last decade to characterize flow interaction with mangrove trees (e.g.: Zhang et al., 2015), there is still a lack of knowledge of the forces exerted on the trees and the attenuation produced under waves, currents and waves and currents flowing simultaneously action.

AB  - This paper highlights the geotechnical challenges faced during reclamation of a soft soil site for an international container shipping terminal in Southern Vietnam. The terminal incorporates a pile-supported wharf with a barge quay and a 60-hectare (150-acre) upland development for container storage. This paper focuses on the settlement and slope stability challenges associated with reclamation of the upland portion of the terminal. Prior to development, the site comprised an intertidal salt marsh with ground surface elevation ranging from about -1 to +3.5 meters (-3.5 to +11.5 feet). Geotechnical exploration and testing indicated that the site was underlain by up to about 45 meters (150 feet) of very soft to stiff, highly compressible clay soils overlying medium dense to very dense sand deposits. In order to accommodate the design tidal range, development plans called for raising site grades to an average elevation of +6 meters (+19.5 feet). Settlement analyses indicated that consolidation settlement in excess of 3 meters (10 feet) could occur in the area of the container yard when site grades were raised and working loads applied. In order to reduce post-construction settlement, a preloading program using closely spaced prefabricated vertical drains was undertaken. Slope stability analyses indicated that placing fill over the weak clay soils would destabilize the waterside slope. Through a series of iterations of geotechnical design and collaboration between the civil/structural and geotechnical engineers, a buttressing system using a thickened section of blanket stone and armor stone was constructed to maintain the stability of the slope. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Phytoremediation, the use of green plants to treat and control wastes in water, soil, and air, is an important part of the new field of ecological engineering. In situ and ex situ applications are governed by site soil and water characteristics, nutrient sustainability, meteorology, hydrology, feasible ecosystems, and contaminant characteristics. Phytotoxicity and mass transport limitations or bioavailability tend to be critical in applications. Most applications are inexpensive due to the reliance on sunlight and recycling of nutrients in situ but treatments over large land areas and longer times for treatment are usually limited to root zones and shallow water. Applications of wetlands, grasslands, crops, and tree plantations have been successful for a variety of wastes, usually present in low concentrations that are not acutely phytotoxic. Organic and inorganic wastes include metals and metalloids, some xenobiotic contaminants, and salts leachate, sewage, sludge, and other conventional wastes. Some redundant or back-up treatment may be necessary depending on the acuteness of toxicity to offset the variability of biological systems. However, very few phytoremediation techniques have been optimized for sustainability using the fundamental principles of ecological engineering. Applications of monocultures of hybrids and sometimes alien species, and simple ecosystems of plants and microorganisms are feasible but difficult to apply in some cases. Self-engineering and self-design need to be explored and used to apply sustainable ecosystems to manage wastes. The key to applying sustainable ecosystems is the knowledge of the genetic and proteomic diversity necessary to select plants and other organisms with optimal activities to transform or accumulate pollutants. Most of the proteomes of plants (approximately 10 000 proteins for all species) have not been adequately explored to optimize and understand the range of possible phytoremediation applications. Furthermore, the metabolism or degradation of the approximately 200 000 secondary plant metabolites needs to be understood. If the structure and activity of a xenobiotic chemical are similar to that of a secondary metabolite, there is a good chance that a sustainable phytoremediation application is possible. Because some xenobiotic compounds may not be analogous to any secondary metabolite, some genetic engineering may be necessary to sustainably manage these unusual wastes. Plants seem to be the optimal organism in which to transplant (1) microbial genes to achieve more mineralization of organic contaminants and (2) mammalian genes that may have greater activity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 1993 the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project (SMBRP) established the Public Involvement and Education (PIE) Fund to support programs that creatively and effectively educate Los Angeles County residents about ways to 1) restore and protect Santa Monica Bay, and 2) maintain a health ecosystem for the region. The SMBRP funds numerous outreach programs developed both by and for government and other public agencies, educators, environmental organizations, trade groups, business professionals, artists, etc. These projects represent the efforts of those who are committed to protecting coastal and inland resources such as aquatic, marine and coastal habitats; drinking water sources; wetlands; beaches/intertidal zones; etc. A specific project funded through the PIE program is highlighted in this paper -- it addresses the need for providing a tool to help cities and industries educate themselves about storm water-related issues. The tool, a workshop module, was developed to do just this; it's a step-by-step manual that outlines the procedures to successfully host a storm water educational workshop.

AB  - <jats:p><p>With climate change becoming more widely understood, we are beginning to see how this phenomenon is impacting on our ability to live coastally. Coastal properties represent some of the most expensive real estate in the country, however these properties are being battered by increasing storm surges causing coastal erosion and decay to the land on which they sit. This is resulting in people fighting to keep their homes out of the water, along with an increasing need for a solution to keep the water out of their homes. In Raumati, sea walls began appearing in the 1950s with people blocking their individual properties from the ocean with wooden log walls. These walls have continued to get larger, higher and more solid until they have become the rock accumulation, stone path and concrete walls that stand today along almost the entire length of the Kapiti Coast.  The impact of such walls is that, while they protect the land immediately behind them, they cause greater issues further down the coast, causing sections of the coastline to deteriorate at a far more accelerated rate. The aim of this project will be to put an end to the Kapiti sea wall by addressing the site at the southern end of Raumati where this erosion is becoming increasingly evident. Here, the delicate sand dunes are being eaten away by heightened storm surges and an ever-increasing sea level.  Rather than looking at it as a negative effect, this thesis will explore the opportunities that are opened by this decay. The project proposes the reinstating and re-wetting of the once drained wetlands that lie behind the natural dunes. Above these wetlands, a ranger’s hut will act as a home, embassy and church within Queen Elizabeth Park. This allows for a greater sense of custodianship, with more people coming, going and staying within the park. The project outcome will be a building that combines public and private spaces. It will allow for the fluctuation in sea levels to interact with and become a part of the building, rather than being excluded through traditional approaches to dealing with climate change on coastlines. Hence, this ranger’s hut will put an end to the sea wall.</p></jats:p>

AB  - The Boscombe Reef is a multipurpose reef structure designed primarily for the enhancement of surfing amenity at Boscombe, Poole Bay, England. The reef was designed to maximise the small and generally poor-quality surfing wave climate of the eastern English Channel coast. The reef was constructed from 54 large, sand filled geotextile containers ranging in size from 1 to 5 m diameters and 15 to 70 m long with a total volume of approximately 13,000 m3. Construction of the reef began in the summer of 2008, was suspended during the following winter and was completed in the late summer of 2009. The reef is now in service and provides a high intensity right hand surfing ride of up to 70 m and a shorter left hand ride of up to 30 m. Although the reef was not designed as a coastal protection structure, monitoring of the morphological response supports that the reef promotes shore protection through the formation of an inshore salient.

AB  - Coastal cities face flood-related hazards exacerbated by climate change and sea level rise, including erosion, storm surge, high wave events, and increased flood frequencies. In order to minimize flood damage and prolong the use of coastal lands, nature-based infrastructure and living shorelines can provide habitat, dissipate wave energy, and maintain people’s connection to the water. In this chapter, the living shorelines approach to planning, designing, and evaluating resilient coastal communities is described and evaluated for two different communities on the island of O’ahu, Hawai’i. One is a rural, high energy wave environment, Sunset Beach, while the other is a medium wave energy, urban resort district, Waikiki Beach. After identifying flood risks over time, site-specific restoration of coastal sand dunes, vegetation (groundcover, shrubs, trees), and coral reefs are proposed through interactive visualization methods alongside supporting case studies. The principles, tools, and techniques for planners, designers, and practitioners involved in coastal hazard mitigation and adaptation are described. Future research needs are identified such as quantify flood mitigation effectiveness; measure costs and benefits; and enact policies to require consideration and ease implementation of living shorelines. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper presents the results of exhaustive experimental work focused on evaluating the efficiency of two devices as wave energy converters and as coastal protection alternatives. The first device is a wave amplifier that by means of overtopping stores water in a reservoir where potential energy can be used to produce power. The second device, the Blow-Jet, is a novel proposal that gathers together the operation of a tapchan and a blowhole to generate an intermittent jet that can easily feed a turbine. Results show that for both devices there is a strong dependency on the wave climate but that there is a possibility of optimizing geometric designs. Transmission coefficient values obtained for the Blow-Jet point to a real chance for its use as a multi-purpose coastal structure.

AB  - Over the past fifty years, the intensive use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture (both inorganic fertilizers and liquid manures) as well as the increase in urban emissions has significantly boosted the terrigenous inputs of nutrient substances into the aquatic environment. In many parts of the world, this enrichment in nitrate (resulting mainly from the leaching and washing out of arable soils and land), as well as in ammonium (very abundant in urban waste emissions) and phosphate (coming from urban wastes and arable soils erosion), has caused a change in the nutrient balance of aquatic environments, called eutrophication. This phenomenon is expressed by a superabundant algal production often followed by a drop in dissolved oxygen levels prejudicial to fauna, and a modification of the algal biodiversity. Eutrophication initially affected lakes with very slow renewal, but then spread to many major rivers, and finally, over the last thirty years, to some large estuaries and bays. The phenomenon of lethal anoxia can occur in summer over vast areas of shallow seas influenced by the inputs of large rivers. The French coasts are generally little affected by the phenomena of massive eutrophication owing to the tidal currents in the English Channel-Atlantic region and the rapidly increasing water depths of the Mediterranean. However, there are some local cases of very disturbed sites, some displaying a proliferation of green macroalgae ("green tides" in Brittany), and others affected by a rapid multiplication of phytoplankton (bays of the Vilaine, Seine and Somme). In fresh water, phosphorus is the main limiting nutrient and the factor controlling plant production (Schindler et al., 1978). In marine environments, by contrast, phosphorus maintains this key role only in the brackish waters of river plumes, and this is only observed in spring: along with silicon, phosphorus can control the intensity of the spring diatom bloom. But summer blooms, in particular those involving dinoflagellates (several of which are toxic) and species generating hypoxia at the bottom in stratified seas, remain controlled by nitrogen, in the same way as the coastal "green tides" caused by green seaweed (Ulva, Enteromorpha, Monostroma, etc.). Mathematical modelling studies of these two types of eutrophication (caused by phytoplankton or macroalgae) help improve our understanding of the respective roles of nitrogen and phosphorus in causing these harmful effects and improve the quality of recommendations for their mitigation. Retrospective simulations of the past thirty years show that, by strongly decreasing the urban and industrial phosphorus emissions, but without decreasing the agricultural nitrogen inputs, we have certainly reduced the spring blooms of diatoms. However, at the same time, we have enhanced the competitiveness of prymnesiophyte nanoflagellates, which are able to grow in waters almost exhausted in phosphorus: this explains the importance of coastal foams of Phaeocystis that affect the shorelines in May from the Baie de Somme to the German Bight.

AB  - Analysis of data from four extensive fish surveys in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary indicated that splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus, endemic to the Central Valley of California, declined by 62% over a 13-year period. Splittails are now found mostly in the estuary, a fraction of their former range. In a gill-net survey in August 1994, 50% of the splittails taken in the estuary were from the Suisun Bay area, and 50% were just upstream in shallow, well-vegetated areas. Splittails migrate into freshwater to spawn, and river outflow carries juveniles into productive, shallow, low-salinity areas downstream. The high correlation of abundance of young with river outflow (average r super(2), 0.60) and a weak stock-recruitment relationship (r super(2) = 0.22) indicate that spawning success depends on favorable environmental conditions created by high outflows, such as the number of days that lowland areas remain flooded in the spring. A repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that splittails prefer shallow, low-salinity habitats. The reductions in splittail abundance and range and the movements and habitat preferences of splittail young and adults correspond to trends and habits of two other species characteristic of the estuary, delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys. The largest threats to these three species are changes in water management and increases in water diversions that reduce spawning and rearing areas and other low-salinity habitats in Suisun Bay.

AB  - Recent studies showed that one third of the Belgian coastline is not sufficiently protected against severe storm events. Therefore coastal protection plans are set up to assure a minimum safety standard for the entire coastline. Flood risk calculations constitute the main input parameter for the concept and planning phases. Since 100% safety can never be guaranteed, contingency plans are constructed to reduce the remaining flood risks. Flood risk calculations are a powerful communicative and operational instrument to use between engineers and experts on the field, thus forming the link between coastal management and disaster planning.

AB  - Jamaica Bay, located within the Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, covers 67.3 square kilometers and opens into the Atlantic Ocean via Rockaway Inlet. In the early 1900's, Jamaica Bay was an extensive estuarine ecosystem that sustained large expanses of salt marsh. Over the last century, urban and industrial development has modified the natural environment surrounding the marsh islands through activities such as dredging and filling, construction, pollution, and over-harvesting or eradication of native plant and animal species. Based on aerial photography interpretation of Jamaica Bay, the New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC), estimated that approximately 567 hectares of tidal salt marsh have been lost since 1924, with the rate of loss rapidly increasing in recent years. At Elders Point between 1994 and 1999 an estimated 89 hectares of salt marsh were lost at a rate of 17.8 hectares per year. It is estimated that if this trend continues, all remaining salt marsh within Jamaica Bay may be lost over the next three decades. Our work involves a multi-agency group led by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to restore the tidal wetlands of Elders Point East and consists of the placement of fill, regrading the site to appropriate elevations for the target community, and planting with native coastal plant species. This design was based on the approximate extent of the 1974 marsh coverage as reported by NYSDEC. Restoration efforts have included extensive monitoring to ensure worthwhile ecological goals have been provided and are a long term sustainable benefit to Jamaica Bay. Challenges that need to be overcome include compaction, subsidence, and erosion of placed material. Additionally, accretion of material and plant survival will require monitoring. The sustainability and plant survival will be an ongoing challenge with physical, chemical, and biological stresses present in the bay. Monitoring data to date have indicated that the project has provided much of the anticipated benefits with minimal erosion or deposition of sediment and Spartina alterniflora has exhibited a growth rate consistent with the control marsh at JoCo. The sustainability of Elders Point East will have important implications regarding future salt marsh restoration efforts (e.g., Elders Point West) and likely serve as a benchmark for similar projects. © 2011 ASCE.

AB  - Examples of nutritional stress in conifer seedlings caused by competing ericaceous species (e. g. Calluna andKalmia), have been reported in several parts of the world. Nutritional stress (primarily N deficiency) has been reported in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations growing in association with an ericaceous species, salal (Gaultheria shallon), in coastal British Columbia. Nutritional interference by salal was investigated on a chronosequence of sites up to 10 yr after clearcutting and slashburning. No direct evidence for an allelopathic contribution to the N stress was obtained. However, the rapid accumulation of salal fine roots and rhizomes, and the nutrients contained therein, provides a partial explanation for the observed stress symptoms. Soil analyses and seedling bioassays demonstrated a reduction in fertility in the period 8 to 10 yr after clearcutting and slashburning in comparison to the period 2 to 4 yr, which is believed to impose further nutritional stress on Sitka spruce. It is concluded that the nutritional stress in these Sitka spruce plantations is caused by a combination of (1) salal competition for nutrients and their subsequent immobilization in salal biomass, and (2) declining site fertility caused by the termination of the flush of nutrients (the “assart period”) that occurs in the immediate post-clearcutting and slashburning period. Sustaining good growth of plantations under such circumstances will require site nutrient management as well as vegetation management.

AB  - Examples of nutritional stress in conifer seedlings caused by competing ericaceous species (e.g. Calluna and Kalmia), have been reported in several parts of the world. Nutritional stress (primarily N deficiency) has been reported in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations growing in association with an ericaceous species, salal (Gaultheria shallon), in coastal British Columbia. Nutritional interference by salal was investigated on a chronosequence of sites up to 10 yr after clearcuttmg and slashburning. No direct evidence for an allelopathic contribution to the N stress was obtained. However, the rapid accumulation of salal fine roots and rhizomes, and the nutrients contained therein, provides a partial explanation for the observed stress symptoms. Soil analyses and seedling bioassays demonstrated a reduction in fertility m the period 8 to 10 yr after clearcutting and slashburning in comparison to the period 2 to 4 yr, which is believed to impose further nutritional stress on Sitka spruce. It is concluded that the nutritional stress in these Sitka spruce plantations is caused by a combination of (1) salal competition for nutrients and their subsequent immobilization in salal biomass, and (2) declining site fertility caused by the termination of the flush of nutrients (the “assart period”) that occurs in the immediate post-clearcutting and slashburning period. Sustaining good growth of plantations under such circumstances will require site nutrient management as well as vegetation management.

AB  - ABSTRACT The intentional release of an estimated 11 million barrels of oil during the 1991 Gulf War was the largest oil spill in history. An assessment of the physical, chemical, and ecological impacts of this spill shows that, 12 years later, oil residues and habitat modifications continue to have toxic effects on intertidal communities. As of 2003, there are an estimated 8 million cubic meters of oiled sediment remaining along the 803 km of impacted shoreline in Saudi Arabia. Of this volume, 45% occurs in muddy tidal flats and 23% in salt marshes and mangroves. Much of the oil in these sheltered habitats occurs as oiled crab burrows, with liquid oil remaining in the burrows to depths that exceed 50 cm. These habitats show the lowest degree of ecological recovery since the spill, with 87% of the upper intertidal zones of mangroves and marshes and 71 % of muddy tidal flats having reduced species richness and a disturbed community structure. Those habitats exposed to the greatest amount of wave activity contain the smallest amount of residual oil; however, on outer sand beaches, the oil is commonly buried to depths exceeding 1 m. The factors that affect the ecological recovery of the intertidal habitats include: 1) The chemical toxicity of the oil residues; 2) the physical toxicity of heavy and hardened oil residues; 3) other physical barriers that affect seed germination of plants, settlement of larvae, and burrowing; 4) limited sources for recruitment of biota; 5) reduced hydrological functioning of tidal channels. This study shows the importance of oil removal as the first phase of habitat recovery. It also indicates the potential for large-scale damage by blatant acts of eco-terrorism.

AB  - ABSTRACT In 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard developed an Incident Action Plan (IAP) to remove oil and hazardous materials from nine foreign-owned tuna longliner vessels grounded on the reef flat within Pago Pago Harbor, American Samoa. This plan involved the construction of rock and trestle causeways and rock working platforms to access the clusters of vessels, and partial removal of the vessels to access the oil and hazardous materials onboard. A natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) study was conducted to quantify the injuries associated with the response action and scale emergency restoration alternatives. A rapid field assessment program was implemented to characterize the benthic habitats around the grounded vessels and in the footprints of the proposed rock and trestle causeways and working platforms. Likely impacts to the dominant habitat types (coral, algal turf, and Halimeda/algal turf communities) from the proposed response actions were: (1) crushing and mortality in areas of fill deposition; (2) partial crushing in spillage zones around fill areas; (3) damages to the reef flat rock platform and framework due to collapse and fracturing; (4) physical injury from remobilization of residual materials remaining on the flat after fill removal; (5) water quality impacts from increased suspended sediment levels during fill placement, use, and removal; and (6) shading impacts to biota under trestles. These injuries were quantified in terms of the dimensions and degree of mortality and/or reduced function for different impacts. Habitat recovery rates for physical crushing and shading were developed, as well. Emergency restoration options were identified and scaled in terms of habitat credits, with one of the preferred options being complete removal of the vessel hulls followed by reef stabilization.

AB  - The sand dune habitats found on barrier islands and other coastal areas support a dynamic plant community while protecting areas further inland from waves and wind. Foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats common to most coastal dunes have very different vegetation, likely because of the interplay among plant succession, exposure, disturbance, and resource availability. However, surprisingly few long-term data are available describing dune vegetation patterns. A nine-year census of 294 plots on St. George Island, Florida suggests that the major climatic drivers of vegetation patterns vary with habitat. Community structure is correlated with the elevation, soil moisture, and percent soil ash of each 1 m(2) plot. Major storms reduce species richness in all three habitats. Principle coordinate analysis suggests that changes in the plant communities through time are caused by climatic events: changes in foredune vegetation are correlated with temperature and summer precipitation, interdune vegetation with storm surge, and backdune vegetation with precipitation and storm surge. We suggest that the plant communities in foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats tend to undergo succession toward particular compositions of species, with climatic disturbances pushing the communities away from these more deterministic trajectories.

AB  - The paper shows through 4 schemes (four circles) the way of coastal protection practices in France. Since a few years, the French way in coastal protection against sea erosion has been seriously modified. The very critical glance on coastal works and practices has brought into question the power of Corps of Engineers and the capacity they have to understand what was the best way. As a consequence, a series of texts purpose a new definition of coastal protection policy.Original Abstract: Depuis quelques annees, la France comme la plupart des pays d'economie developpee, a renforce sa legislation en matiere de protection du littoral. D'une facon particuliere, la lutte contre l'erosion marine a fait l'objet de deux demarches. D'une maniere indirecte, l'Etat a cherche a eviter la protection en freinant l'urbanisation du lineaire cotier. D'une maniere directe - mais sous la pression des associations de protection de la nature - il a ete conduit a de nouvelles propositions sans pour autant changer la legislation en vigueur. !l l'a fait de facon aussi globale que possible, montrant ainsi la capacite du corps des ingenieurs a toutes les critiques portees contre des usages qui illustrent parfaitement des pratiques sociales autour d'un probleme de nature que le texte formalise a travers 4 de decision.

AB  - Background: Sewage treatments are not efficient to eliminate enteric microorganisms. Viruses are able to persist and are discharged into the marine environment with treated effluents. Few data are now available on the magnitude and the contributive processes of marine viral contamination. This work evaluates the relationship between the magnitude of rainfall and the viral contamination of the marine environment during winter epidemics of gastroenteritis in human coastal populations. Methods: A RT-PCR method was used to detect enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk-like virus, astrovirus and rotavirus in shellfish, harvested monthly between August 1995 and July 1998. The frequency of virus detection in shellfish was expressed as an Index of Viral Contamination. Acute gastroenteritis in the population was estimated using the French Sentinel System for Monitoring of Communicable Diseases. Rainfall effects on the efficiency of sewage treatment were assessed using an estimated staving time of sewage effluents in the plant. Results: The results indicate that the highest viral contamination occurs in winter. Maximal indexes of viral contamination were respectively 70% in January 1996, 100% in January 1997 but only 31% in January 1998. Viral contamination variations seemed to follow the pattern of the winter epidemic of acute gastroenteritis in the local population in 1996 and 1997 These observations should be linked to the winter rainfalls. Heavy mins on short periods of time could create fin hydraulic overload in the sewage treatment plant, reducing the staying time of the sewage effluents and thus the efficiency of the disinfection process. Conclusion: The magnitude of the viral contamination of shellfish seems to result from the simultaneity between the winter epidemics of acute gastroenteritis in the coastal population and heavy rainfall. To prevent public health hazards associated with shellfish consumption, the monitoring of microbiological quality in shellfish harvesting areas should include accompagning survey of viral epidemic in the coastal population, and of sewage outputs in the coastal environment.

AB  - Traditionally, coffee is cultivated under a shading canopy of native trees in tropical areas of the world. Within the U.S., coffee is cultivated only in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Shade coffee plantations are a simplified but stable agro-ecosystem. Their shading canopy provides most of the ecological functions of natural environments such as nutrient recycling, habitat for native, endemic and migratory birds, and shelter for many plant and wildlife species including endangered species. In Puerto Rico, shade coffee plantations have played a critical role in protecting biodiversity by providing habitat and reducing sedimentation during a time period when the landscape was severely deforested. During these times, coffee plantations served as refugia for many species and protected marine environments by reducing runoff and pollution. Now, shade coffee has a similar or even more important role than it did during the first half of the 20th century. With the ever-increasing human population and associated development and the fact that coffee became Puerto Rico's principal agricultural crop, these plantations are a vital component of any conservation initiative in tropical United States. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Partners for Fish & Wildlife Program in the Caribbean focuses on the restoration of the native shading canopy in coffee plantations. This is the only shade coffee restoration effort currently occurring within the U.S. Of the ~10,000 hectares of coffee in Puerto Rico, less than 40% are under shade. We developed simple habitat restoration procedures in order to protect Federal trust resources in tropical U.S. We use native vegetation in spatial arrangement that provide important habitat for wildlife and reduces erosion and runoff, while maintaining the agricultural value and the acceptance of landowners. In only five years, we started the program and have restored more than 600 ha. The Service's efforts with shade coffee restoration projects provide a model to be used as a management tool for private lands around tropical forest reserves in the U.S. and elsewhere protecting not only upland areas but also enhancing the health of coastal ecosystems. These practices are also an economical incentive for a sustainable way of farming which protects the environment and conserves the traditional way of cultivating the land in tropical environments.

AB  - The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30-500 m. The result highlights that about 60.33% of the total transects of the study area was eroded, but only 24.99% of the total transects experienced accretion, and 14.68% of the total transects depicted stability. The scientific study will benefit coastal managers and policymakers in formulating action plans for coastal zone management, natural resilience, and sustainable future development.

AB  - Extreme heat events cause patchy mortality in many habitats. We examine biophysical mechanisms responsible for patchy mortality in beds of the competitively dominant ecosystem engineer, the marine mussel Mytilus californianus, on the west coast of the United States. We used a biophysical model to predict daily fluctuations in body temperature at sites from southern California to Washington and used results of laboratory experiments on thermal tolerance to determine mortality rates from body temperature. In our model, we varied the rate of thermal conduction within mussel beds and found that this factor can account for large differences in body temperature and consequent mortality during heat waves. Mussel beds provide structural habitat for other species and increase local biodiversity, but, as sessile organisms, they are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions. Identifying critical biophysical mechanisms related to mortality and ecological performance will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these vulnerable ecosystems.

AB  - Pitcher plant bogs, also referred to as hillside seepage bogs or hillside bogs, are extremely restricted on the West Gulf Coastal Plain. The number and extent of extant bogs is in the low hundreds, comprising no more than a few thousand hectares of habitat. These bogs support a large number of plant species of significant conservation concern. Threats to existing bogs include: land use changes, silvicultural impacts, fire scarcity, vehicle damage, negative feral hog (Sus scrofa) impact, and ground water regime alterations. Two pitcher plant bogs on the Angelina National Forest were subjected to severe damage from vehicular impacts that eliminated herbaceous vegetation, disturbed the soil to substantial depths, and initiated severe erosion. A restoration effort that replaced lost soil, reduced erosion, and allowed subsequent revegetation was implemented. Approximately four years post-treatment, bogs are intact, soil erosion is controlled, revegetation is complete or progressing, and at least some species of conservation concern are present in the revegetated areas. These restoration projects have demonstrated that degraded pitcher plant bogs that have suffered severe damage due to vehicular impacts can be substantially restored if sufficient resources are available. However, pitcher plant bogs on the West Gulf Coastal Plain continue to be threatened by uncontrolled off-road vehicles and other impacts. The most insidious threat may be the widespread lack of sufficient fire required to preclude or reverse succession to communities dominated by woody vegetation and the subsequent loss of the herbaceous bog species.

AB  - Coastal foredunes are natural features, reflecting interaction among geomorphological, biological and ecological processes. Their formation depends on a wide range of spatially and temporally variable environmental factors, but is usually associated with strong and prevailing onshore winds, an ample supply of sediment for aeolian transport and the presence of vegetation to trap sand. Foredunes can, however, be found under more complex wind regimes where offshore winds are common such as the UK East coast, Northern Ireland, and New Zealand. This paper documents the evolution of the foredunes along the North Lincolnshire coast, and in particular at two sites, one characterized by a wide beach and the second by a small vegetated embryo dunefield on the upper beach. Historical ortho-images from 1953 to 2009 were generated from vertical aerial photographs. These were combined with an analysis of historical climate and oceanographic external forcing factors to attempt to explain the spatial and temporal variability in foredune evolution. The medium-term foredune tendency indicates a mean seaward migration of 2 m year -1 along this coastline. The general evolutionary pattern of the accretional coastal foredunes reflects the impacts of the forcing factors and suggests rapid recovery following storm-surges.

AB  - Shallow water flow models are an important tool for forecasting storm surges and predicting the effects of human interventions in estuaries. The accuracy of shallow water flow models is mainly determined by the accuracy of its inputs, such as depth, friction coefficient and the tide at the so called open boundary. In order to obtain accurate model results, the model has to be calibrated, which means that the model input is adapted so that the model results fit the available measurements more closely. For this purpose an automatic calibration method, based on the adjoint method, has been developed to estimate the uncertain parameters in an efficient way. The parameters are adapted in a way to increase the similarity between the measured waterlevels and the computed waterlevels. Recently the shallow water flow models are being used increasingly to provide the input for pollutant and sediment transport models. This change in use has resulted in a demand for more accurate current predictions. For this purpose, the calibration method has been extended to improve the current predictions of the shallow water flow models.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2015 - Genova Conference Start Date: 2015, May 18 Conference End Date: 2015, May 21 Conference Location: Genova, Italy Since the early ages tropical insular societies have lived on the oceans edge depending on it for essential functions ranging from transportation and nourishment to recreation. These services are also accompanied by the risk posed by hazardous winds, waves, currents, storm surge and tsunamis. In recent times coastal societies have also faced the risk of losing valuable services provided by the ocean due to anthropogenic disturbances. Technological and scientific advances have made possible to detect and even predict with reasonable accuracy almost all major threats coming from the ocean. Moreover, although the timing of events like tsunamis cannot be predicted their potential impact can be assessed. Under the US Integrated Ocean Observing System, the Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System (CariCOOS) faces the challenge to provide decision making support required for improving the safety of coastal communities and marine operations, enhance the economy through enhanced efficiency of the latter and by and protecting the environment. Major achievements toward the above goals include the deployment of data buoys and meteorological stations at representative areas and the operational implementation of high resolution wave and weather models capable of accurately filling observational gaps and providing accurate wind and wave and nearshore breaker height forecasts. A storm surge atlas is now in use by state and federal agencies. An assessment of the chronicity of sediment inputs to sensitive coral reefs, utilizing remote sensed ocean color data is available to resource managers. Below we discuss approaches and strategies followed implementing the system as well that to be followed for its further development.

AB  - Renewed interest in tidal energy in the UK has triggered new debates about the possible benefits of constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary and several other estuaries and bays in England. This paper explores the use of analogues to provide an initial picture of the likely responses. It describes the critical elements of the responses identified in the analogues and highlights the pathways that are responsible for observed changes. The analogues used can be applied to a range of structures; from tidal energy barrages to tidal fences and tidal reefs, as well as to tidal lagoons within estuaries. The critical relationship that emerges is that between sub-tidal depositional environments and the effects of wind-driven wave erosion within the inter-tidal zone. Erosion by winddriven waves leads to sediment suspension and subsequent deposition in deeper sub-tidal water where reduced tidal propagation also limits re-mobilisation that is needed to return sediment onto inter-tidal environments during sediment-building phases. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The population biology and ecology of scallops in Greater Omaha Bay (a semi-oceanic bay) and Kawau Bay (a estuarine bay) was quantified by observation and experiment. Information was collected to extend the knowledge base on northern New Zealand scallop population dynamics, and for application to potential scallop enhancement in the region. Contagious scallop population organisation was found at all spatial scales examined, ranging from bay wide through to individual bed patchiness, down to the scale of inter-animal distances. Such clumping has strong implications for a range of population processes, including fishing susceptibility and fertilisation success. Monitoring of adults found two main spawning events to occur; in late October and in mid January. Changes in the gonado-somatic index (GSI) were well synchronised between individuals within populations. Subsequent monitoring of spat-fall in artificial collectors documented two main recruitment events, probably the outcomes of the two local spawning events. These spat-fall events occurred on collectors separated by 1Os of km. However, substantial density variations occurred between sites, indicating that local hydrodynamics may have played a significant role in modifying local spat-fall intensities. Smaller spat-fall events were also present between the two major events. The number of spat collected at a number of combinations of site and time were sufficient to support commercial spat catching operations, although problems were encountered with spat detaching at sizes too small to be retained by the collectors. In the 1993/94 summer a large algal bloom event completely eliminated scallop recruitment to collectors for the first three months of that season. Mass mortality events were a major contributor to overall benthic scallop population mortality. Probable causes included intensive scallop harvesting (commercial and recreational), a major storm episode, and a large algal bloom. These effectively eliminated scallop populations from Greater Omaha Bay. The adjacent Kawau Bay was not affected by any of these particular events, but populations there did not survive long after reaching adult sizes. Estimates of M (natural mortality) were higher for all scallop populations than have been previously documented in New Zealand studies. Growth trajectories were reasonably consistent in waters shallower than 19 m, but a progressive decline occurred in both maximal size reached and average growth rates with increasing depth after this point. Food limitation may have been the mechanism involved, which is likely to vary significantly for other locations depending on local environmental conditions. Average time to recruitment to the fishery (100 mm shell width) was three years for the shallower populations. A slight reduction in average size of adults at higher densities was found for some populations, indicating a possible density-dependent effect. Examination of a high density scallop bed found animals to display distinctive substratum preferences over small spatial scales, with higher abundances occurring on coarser materials such as shell gravel, marl and grit. Mud was not favoured as a habitat type. Movements of tagged animals at this location were spatially limited to within the particular habitat patch in which an individual was tagged and released, i.e. at a scale of 1s to 1Os of metres. No animals moved between adjacent patches of similar habitat (100 m scale). A B.A.C.I type experiment was undertaken to assess incidental mortality effects of commercial scallop dredging on undersize scallops, at the spatial scale of beds. Significant negative effects were quantified, with the number of undersize animals killed per legal animal harvested estimated at 1.7 and 2.8 : 1, depending on the size frequency structure of the fished bed. Modelling of likely improvements in the number of animals surviving at the end of fishing, given a reduction in the minimum legal size from 100 to 90 mm, indicated improvements of 20 to 41 percent of the original population remaining after fis ing, depending on animal size and assumed dredge efficiencies, A 90 mm MLS has subsequently been adopted by the Coromandel Scallop Fishery. The results from this work provide detailed population based estimates of parameters required for successful management and optimal harvesting strategies of Hauraki Gulf scallop populations. The large variability in parameters such as mortality, and strong abundance correlations with habitat type, has strong implications for such activities. This work also provides essential information for the undertaking of locally based enhancement operations, such as the spatial and temporal magnitude and variability of spat-fall events, and growth rates with respect to habitat features (i.e. depth).

AB  - In marine wetlands, nitrogen fixation is a potentially important nutrient source for nitrogen-limited primary producers, but interactions between nitrogen fixer's and different vascular plant species are not fully understood. Nitrogen fixation activity was compared in sediments vegetated by three plant species, Spartina foliosa, Salicornia virginica, and Salicornia bigelovii in the Kendall Frost Reserve salt marsh in Mission Bay (CA). This study addressed the effects of plant type, day and night conditions, and sediment depths on nitrogen fixation. Higher rates of nitrogen fixation were associated with S. foliosa than with either of the two Salicornia spp., which are known to compete more effectively than Spartina for exogenous nitrogen in the salt marsh environment. Rates of nitrogen fixation, determined by acetylene reduction, in sediments vegetated by S. virginica were low during the day (7.7 +/- 1.2 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1)) but averaged 13 +/- 6.6 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1) at night, with particularly high rates in samples from locations with visible cyanobacterial mats. The opposite diel pattern was found for sediments containing S. foliosa plants, in which average daytime and nighttime rates of nitrogen fixation were 62 +/- 23 and 21 +/- 15 mu mol C2H4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. For S. foliosa, nitrogenase activity of rinsed roots and different sediment sections (0-1, or 4-5 cm depths) were measured. Although nitrogen fixation rates in vegetated sediment samples were substantial, all but one of rinsed S. foliosa root samples (n = 12) and subsurface sediments at 4-5 cm depths failed to show nitrogen fixation activity after 2 h, suggesting that the most active nitrogen fixers in these systems likely reside in, surface sediments. Further, nitrogenase activity in shaded and unshaded S. foliosa samples did not differ, suggesting that nitrogen fixers may not rapidly respond to changes in plant photosynthetic activity. Average nitrogen fixation rates in S. foliosa-vegetated samples from the Mission Bay salt marsh were on the same order as those of highly productive Atlantic coast marshes, and this microbially-mediated nitrogen source may be similarly substantial in other Mediterranean wetlands. Sediment abiotic variables seem to exert greater control upon nitrogen fixation activity than the effects of particular plant species. Nonetheless, dominant plant species may differ substantially in their reliance on nitrogen fixation as a nutrient source, with potentially important consequences for wetland conservation and restoration.

AB  - A 2400 year record of environmental change is reported from a wetland on Bentinck Island in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. Three phases of wetland development are identified, with a protected coastal setting from ca. 2400 to 500 years ago, transitioning into an estuarine mangrove forest from ca. 500 years ago to the 1940s, and finally to a freshwater swamp over the past +60 years. This sequence reflects the influence of falling sea-levels, development of a coastal dune barrier system, prograding shorelines, and an extreme storm (cyclone) event. In addition, there is clear evidence of the impacts that human abandonment and resettlement have on the island's fire regimes and vegetation. A dramatic increase in burning and vegetation thickening was observed after the cessation of traditional Indigenous Kaiadilt fire management practices in the 1940s, and was then reversed when people returned to the island in the 1980s. In terms of the longer context for human occupation of the South Wellesley Archipelago, it is apparent that the mangrove phase provided a stable and productive environment that was conducive for human settlement of this region over the past 1000 years.

AB  - The coastlines of the world's oceans encompass a tremendous variety of geomorphic and geologic structures. They range from rocky cliffs to sandy barrier beaches to low-lying swampy wetlands. The geomorphic forms were created by the interaction of antecedent geology, physical dynamic processes, and man-made intervention. Variable features are usually composed of unconsolidated materials that respond rapidly to changes in the dynamic environment. More stable features are usually associated with consolidated rock or occur in quiescent environments. The geologic history of shorelines can be inferred from a careful study of geomorphic structures, coupled with additional data on physical processes and historic events. Many of the study techniques are relatively simple, consisting of analysis of existing maps and historical sources. An understanding of the processes which have shaped the shore is crucial to the design of coastal structures and to the intelligent management of coastal resources and habitats. In addition, understanding of the form/process relationships between geomorphology and dynamics may allow coastal scientists to more accurately predict the results of construction or other modifications along the shore.

AB  - Salt marshes restored through managed coastal realignment (MR) often develop slowly and show persistent differences in vegetation from natural marshes. Development might be constrained by the availability of propagules or poor suitability of the abiotic environment for their establishment. To distinguish between these factors, we compared vegetation colonization and environmental conditions at a salt marsh created by MR at Brancaster, Norfolk, UK, with five reference marshes, varying in age from 30 to circa 6,000 years. After 5 years, plant communities of the MR site remained different from those in mature reference marshes. In contrast, the communities of the youngest reference marsh were not significantly different from mature reference marshes. At the MR site, abundance of perennial and later-successional species was low and large areas remained unvegetated. These differences are unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation, because 76% of the species from the local species pool colonized the site within 5 years. Although the annuals Salicornia europaea and Suaeda maritima were abundant by year 2, they were not ubiquitous until the end of the study. Tidal elevations of the MR site were suitable for vegetation development, but soil redox potentials were lower than that at the reference sites. Reducing conditions in the MR site appear to be the major cause of vegetation differences from the reference marshes, as they are associated with an abundance of bare ground and a small range of vegetation clusters. Measures to avoid low sediment redox potentials may have a great benefit in some salt marsh restoration projects.

AB  - Living shorelines and other nature-based solutions have become more widely accepted as a cost-effective, multi-functional, and sustainable approach to coastal resilience. However, in spite of growing stakeholder support, a planning-level understanding of the hydrodynamic impact of living shorelines is not well-developed. Not only do these features vary in size, shape, and structural characteristics, but the wave environment in which they exist can be quiescent or extreme. The work presented in this paper explores the hydrodynamic effects of living shoreline features in such a way that can be generalized across a range of varying physical environments. In a series of Simulation WAves Nearshore (SWAN) simulations, we investigate the effect of wave period, wave height, bed slope, living shoreline feature length in the cross-shore direction, and feature friction coefficient on wave attenuation. Results showed that higher wave period, higher wave height, milder slopes, longer feature lengths, and higher feature roughness largely correlated with higher wave attenuation. However, only on mild slopes did additional feature lengths result in appreciable additional attenuation. Characteristic lengths were thus computed to better illustrate the cost-effectiveness of additional feature lengths given a particular wave environment. These characteristic lengths provide one way to evaluate the hydraulic efficacy of proposed living shoreline projects. In this way, regardless of the particularities of individual project sites, we aim to help planners screen potential living shoreline projects before pursuing more detailed, costly analyses.

AB  - In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, household adaptation to climatic variability hinges upon access to wetland resources. Household adaptation may be effective for current flood variability, but inadequate for future climate variability. Government interventions through adaptation planning for flood variability may also be inadequate. This study aimed to improve knowledge on adaptation planning in the Okavango Delta and similar areas in the world. The specific objectives were to determine household exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity to flood-related shocks, identify and assess government interventions for flood variability, and determine the effect of these interventions on household adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta. Informed by the institutional analysis and development framework, the study used data from a survey of 623 households in five villages, some qualitative methods and secondary data sources. The results indicate that households are inherently sensitive to shocks, due to their dependence on natural resource-based livelihood activities, and that most households had sick members (53 %), and were food insecure (74 %). More households were more affected by river desiccation (84 %) than by flooding (23 %). Adaptation planning was implicitly undertaken in the form of disaster risk reduction, and mainstream development and poverty reduction programmes. These effectively contributed to household adaptation to flood variability but inhibited local institutional learning and innovation. Moreover, they were neither participatory nor conformant to local norms and therefore not sustainable in the long term. There is a need to adopt explicit, flexible and participatory approaches to planning to promote autonomous adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta.

AB  - The Morro Bay estuary, located on the central Coast of California approximately half way between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is one of the most important wetlands on the west Coast as it supports wide variety of habitats including numerous sensitive and endangered plant and animal species. Various studies have identified accelerated erosion and subsequent sedimentation as a major threat for sustainability of the bay. Watershed disturbances caused by agricultural activities are believed to be one of the major causes of the accelerated erosion and sedimentation. More than 200 conservation practices have been installed in the watershed since the mid-1990 to reduce erosion and sedimentation. This paper will review the implemented BMPs and will evaluate effectiveness of the BMPs using observations and modeling exercise. Streamflow and sediment concentration, measured mainly during the rainy seasons, are available for multiple locations in the watershed. However, the observations are not sufficient in terms of spatial density and data length to evaluate effectiveness of the mitigation measures at various locations in the watershed. It would be daunting in terms of cost to develop an intensive network of monitoring sites that would be needed for reliable management of NPS pollutants. As a result, comprehensive watershed simulation models that integrate watershed and climate characteristics and can estimate pollutant quantity at various locations, and that can also identify source of the contaminants, is emerging as a key component of watershed management. In this regard, a comprehensive watershed simulation model for the Morro Bay watershed has been developed using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate both streamflow and sediment concentration. The observed data was used to improve prediction accuracy of the SWAT model through parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration steps. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using step-wise-regression analysis and Morris's one-at-a time (OAT) method. Calibration was performed using four different optimization methods: PEST, GeneticAlgorithms, the Shuffled Complex Evolution Algorithm, and Dynamically Dimensioned Search. Relative performance of the sensitivity analysis methods and the calibration algorithms will be discussed in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency. The developed model was used to evaluate effectiveness of the BMPs implemented in the Morro Bay watershed, and can also be used to prioritize sites where BMPs may be implemented in the future to further improve ecological integrity of the estuary. © 2011 ASCE.

AB  - Coastal dunes are Aeolian landforms that form at the interface of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems, mainly associated with dissipative coasts dominated by marine winds with an ample supply of well-sorted sands and occurring on ocean, lake, and estuary shorelines. Distributed worldwide, they comprise very diverse climates and biomes and present a large variety of forms and dimensions related with sediment supply and wind regime, where vegetation plays a relevant role. The influence of the sea determines a series of environmental and biological gradients from the shoreline and landwards. The harsh environment characterized by the scarcity of water and nutrients, substrate mobility and sand burial, incidence of salt spray and sand blasting, high air and soil temperatures and light intensities in low and medium latitudes, and saltwater flooding in the strandline determines the establishment of species of singular sand flora and fauna that are specifically adapted to such stressful conditions. Coastal dune systems have a recognized geomorphological, geological, ecological, historical, archaeological, scenic, cultural, and socioeconomic interest and provide us with different direct and indirect benefits and resources including their role as natural barriers that buffer the effects of storms, sea, and wind. Nevertheless, they cover a really limited global area that is largely endangered at present, mainly due to human direct and indirect impacts. This has led to the development of initiatives and efforts focused on dune conservation, management, and restoration from different disciplines and government levels. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.

AB  - Woody debris is ubiquitous in coastal waters, and on shorelines proximate to forested regions. Logs and driftwood play a vital role in coastal and global ecosystems, and can provide valuable data to support studies of oceanography, geomorphology, ecology, history and archaeology. There is growing interest in the role that woody debris can play in nature-based coastal engineering solutions. However, large quantities of woody debris in coastal waters can pose significant hazards to communities, infrastructure, navigation and ecosystems. Thus, the changing abundance and distribution of coastal driftwood, driven by factors including human activities and climate change, has potential for both positive and negative consequences. A better understanding of coastal driftwood fate and transport processes is needed to inform management practices, uses, and sustainable ecosystem management. To date, research on physical transport of woody debris, has been concentrated on tsunami and inland (riverine) environments, where spatiotemporal scales and driving processes are significantly different from typical climatic or even extreme (storm) conditions in coastal waters. In this paper, we describe a series of scale physical model experiments, conducted to provide insight to debris transport processes in coastal waters under a range of controlled wave and water level conditions. The experiments were conducted in a 50.4-metre by 29.4-metre wave basin, in which a 1/30 scale model of a natural shoreline comprised of a shallow fringing reef, a sandy shoreline, and several small coastal structures (groynes and breakwaters) was constructed. Wooden dowels and tree branches, scaled to replicate the size distribution of woody debris observed on Pacific Northwest shorelines, were released in the model. Despite some limitations (e.g., model scale effects), the experimental test results provided several valuable insights to factors affecting debris mobility in coastal areas. The results will inform the parameterization of important physical processes in a numerical model being developed to predict the fate and transport of woody debris in coastal waters. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - California's valuable coastal resources are used intensely for educational, scientific, commercial, and recreational purposes. Because of the intensity of this utilization, rocky intertidal systems throughout the State are being impacted by human activities, including the pulse disturbances of lawful and unlawful harvesting and the damaging effects of visitor foot traffic and human manipulation of organisms and substrata. In California and elsewhere, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) serve as a primary tool for protecting and sustaining intertidal ecosystems. Throughout much of urban southern California, California Marine Life Refuges (CMLRs) are the principal form of MPA designed to protect intertidal organisms. However, CMLRs allow recreational fishing and, while placing restrictions on the collecting of most species of invertebrates and seaweeds, do not limit visitor access. In a year-long study of eight sites in Orange County, California, four of which have been designated CMLRs since 1968-71, unlawful collecting was observed to be of widespread and frequent occurrence both in and outside historical CMLR boundaries. Human visitation is often extreme on southern California rocky shores and visitor foot traffic is known to damage intertidal organisms. Results of an ongoing experimental study reveal that the canopy-forming rockweed Pelvetia compressa suffers substantial damage from trampling, including the loss of large amounts of potential reproductive material. It is concluded that CMLRs, as currently designed and patrolled, are ineffective in protecting coastal populations in regions of high visitor density. Knowledge of the current status of coastal ecosystems and the processes that affect them should be used to evaluate California's MPA system with the goal of designing truly effective refuges and sanctuaries for sustaining coastal populations.

AB  - Key West, Florida, has been a haven to sun-worshipers for decades. The relaxed attitude of its residents, as well as its beautiful waters, is known around the world. The U.S. Navy determined that the landfill on Fleming Key, currently undergoing extensive shoreline erosion, needed repairs and protection. Accordingly, Bechtel Environmental, Inc., the Navy's Environmental Response Contractor, solicited bids for a Design and Build Shoreline Protection System. The original shoreline protection design was a layer of granite riprap that must be hauled from distant quarries and dumped into place along the shoreline. Ocean Breeze Construction Co., Inc., in association with Delon Hampton and Associates, Chartered, proposed a more cost-effective method to protect the eroding shoreline of the landfill. This method considered the design and construction of an articulated concrete block mattress system, instead of riprap, for the entire 549 meter (1,800 foot) length of the project. The articulated concrete block (ACB) system was placed on a newly constructed 3(H):1(V) slope of granular bedding material and woven monofilament geotextile. Riprap was provided for toe support and scour protection at the base of the ACB system. A 3 meter (10 foot) wide berm was constructed at the top of the slope for vehicle access. The berm is protected from wave over-topping by a permanent erosion reinforcement matrix extending across the top and down the backside of the berm. A small swale was constructed where necessary to divert all wave over-topping to natural areas for infiltration. All disturbed areas landward of the ACB system were vegetated. In addition to the hard-armoring shoreline protection system, sea purslane was planted on the upper 1.22 meters (4 feet) of the slope. Red mangroves were also planted along the last 91 meters (300 feet) of the project to provide the area with a substantial seed base from which both of these indigenous plant species can propagate. Thus, an engineered revetment system, incorporating both hard and soft erosion control techniques and the latest in non-corrosive materials, was designed and constructed to meet the 50-year minimum performance specification requirement.

AB  - The pollution of waterbodies and the environment by the petroleum industry is of particular concern in Nigeria. This problem can be addressed by the application of a constructed wetland (CW) which is a naturebased system that is simple to construct, has low operational and maintenance costs in terms of supply of energy and periodic maintenance. The application of CWs in Nigeria for polishing of petroleum refinery wastewater is an unprecedented research. This PhD thesis focused on some specific objectives which were characterization of treated secondary refinery wastewater, design, construction, operation and monitoring of planted (T. latifolia, C. alternifolius and C. dactylon) and unplanted vertical subsurface flow, horizontal subsurface flow and hybrid CWs for the removal of suspended solids, nutrients,heavy metals, organic matter and organic pollutants. The CWs effectively treated the petroleum contaminated wastewater to effluent compliance limits. In this study, T. latifolia planted CWs had consistently higher removal efficiencies for all the measured parameters than C. alternifolius and C. dactylon planted CW systems. Therefore, in order to improve the wastewater quality discharged by the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) and meet the stringent guidelines as well as protect the recipient streams, installation of CWs at the effluent discharge point of KRPC is strongly recommended.

AB  - This paper presents the navigation implications of a possible Mississippi River mouth re-alignment plan from the perspective of one of the teams selected to compete in the changing course design competition (see changingcourse.us and deltaforall.com for more information). The goals of the competition are to: create a sustainable and functioning deltaic system in areas adjacent to the Mississippi River and below New Orleans; continue to meet the needs of navigation, flood protection and coastal industries and communities; contribute additional innovation, competition, and private sector engagement in time to inform Louisiana's next coastal master plan in 2017 in terms of a possible option for river mouth re-alignment. In this design competition, the primary challenges arise from the meeting of the natural and built environments and the tremendous changes underway. Navigation, shipping, fisheries, coastal industries, communities, and wetland health all face tremendous pressure from these changes. This paper presents a river mouth re-alignment alternative that would provide for a smaller but sustainable delta footprint, at the same time as providing immediate opportunities for dramatic flood risk reduction and a massive upgrade to the navigation system. © ASCE.

AB  - The settlement of embankments and reclamations over soft soils is frequently accelerated qv the use of vertical drains. The magnitude of Long-term settlement is sometimes reduced by the use of surcharge, although there is often uncertainty about how long the surcharge should be maintained to minimise creep movement. The design of vertical drains is generally based on closed-form solutions of Terzaghi's consolidation equation, and rarely takes into account non-linear stiffness and creep of the soil, In this paper a one-dimensional finite difference consolidation analysis is outlined showing how vertical and radial drainage of a multi-layer soil profile in the zone of influence of a vertical drain may; he modelled. The analysis allows inclusion of a zone of peripheral smear around tl le drain and drain resistance, permeabilities may he varied with void ratio, and creep is modelled both during and after primary consolidation. The application of the model is illustrated with back-analysis of field data from construction of an embankment with temporary surcharge over estuarine alluvium.

AB  - Landscape destruction is much prevailing nowadays, with cities expanding coupled with an increasing global population. Accordingly, moving landscapes toward sustainability is needed more than ever before. Although urban and landscape planners have increasingly studied landscape sustainability, understanding the impact of nature-based solutions on landscape sustainability is still obscure. In order to fill this gap, this study provides a framework that identifies the contribution of nature-based solutions (NBS) in environmental, sociocultural, and economic indicators to urban landscape sustainability. The results of this research highlight that the implementation of NBS has the potential to make the urban landscapes more sustainable in the elements including water, soil, air, and vegetation and wildlife as environmental; health, security, education, place-based values, visual quality, and social relationship as sociocultural; and tourism, employment, energy, agriculture, and waste management and recycling as economic dimension.

AB  - This paper describes a geomorphic channel design proposed for a six mile tidally influenced reach of the Napa River. The design includes restoration of historic estuarine marshland and alluvial floodplain features to achieve 100-year flood damage mitigation objectives for the city of Napa and to allow for continued navigation use. The design demonstrates the compatibility of ecologic restoration and flood damage mitigation objectives when they are given equal weight in the design process.

AB  - Bioturbating macrofauna can have major effects on their physical, biological and biogeochemical surroundings, altering ecosystem functioning. Austrohelice crassa (herein Austrohelice) is a burrow building estuarine crab endemic to New Zealand. The abundant and widespread nature of this species infers that its effects on sediment processes are likely to be significant. This thesis explores Austrohelice's impact on ecosystem functioning quantifying both density and habitat induced differences in sediment reworking rates, solute and particle fluxes. The underpinning mechanisms by which changes are mediated are also examined. It is hypothesised that organism behaviour, sediment type and interactions between both factors have the potential to mediate changes to ecosystem functioning. Sediment reworking rates were calculated from four parameters: burrow and crab density, burrow morphology, burrow permanency and burrow maintenance, measured across a sedimentary gradient. Burrows were over 18 times more stable in mud than sand equating to over an order of magnitude reduction in sediment reworking rates, shifting the primary bioturbational role from burrow builder in mud to sediment mixer (bulldozer) in sand. Burrow decay rates, combined with differences in burrow and crab densities, were primarily responsible for changes in reworking rates among sediment types. An in situ density manipulation experiment was conducted in a non-cohesive sand and a cohesive muddy-sand to test the hypothesis that the functional plasticity of Austrohelice among sediment types would be reflected in measures of solute exchange; a proxy for ecosystem functioning. In both habitats, Austrohelice regulated nutrient cycling, creating strong density driven effects on solute exchanges. Increasing crab density enhanced sediment O2 demand and the flux of NH4+ from the sediment, indicating much of the response was physiologically driven. Despite lowering microphyte standing stock through deposit feeding, Austrohelice also increased benthic primary production per unit of chlorophyll a. Important context-specific differences were also revealed, most notably for NH4+ fluxes, which were higher where burrows and their associated microbial communities were most stable. Laboratory based flume experiments were conducted to test if increasing burrow density amplified sediment erodibility and if the different reworking rates (and hence functionality) between sediment types, would affect sediment stability. Context-specific effects on particle fluxes associated with burrow density were observed among sediment types. Increasing burrow density reduced erodibility in cohesive mud, whereas in non-cohesive sand erosion rates were unimodal, being greatest at low burrow densities. Increased trapping of bedload material alongside a reduction in flow velocity due to surficial pellets was attributed to the reduction in the mass of sediment eroded in sand at high burrow densities. In mud, the linear decrease in erodibility associated with increased burrow density was attributed to crab activity at low tide whereby high concentrations of fine particles (silt-clay) are sluiced from burrows, creating both a smoothing and consolidating effect on the sediment surface. This thesis highlights the value of assessing organism characteristics and behaviour alongside organism density to identify the mechanisms which govern ecosystem level processes among habitats. Integration of such information in to functional group studies and sediment dynamic models will broaden conceptual frameworks and avoid oversimplification of highly complex organism-sediment interactions.

AB  - Although seed dispersal is assumed to be a major factor determining plant community development in restored wetlands, little research exists on density and species richness of seed available through dispersal in these systems. We measured composition and seed dispersal rates at a restored tidal freshwater marsh in Washington, DC, USA by collecting seed dispersing through water and wind. Seed dispersal by water was measured using two methods of seed collection: (1) stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat along an elevation gradient bracketing the tidal range and (2) a floating surface trawl net attached to a boat. To estimate wind dispersal rates, we collected seed from stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat positioned above marsh vegetation. We also collected a small number of samples of debris deposited along high tide lines (drift lines) and feces of Canada Goose to explore their seed content. We used the seedling emergence method to determine seed density in all samples, which involved placing the fiber mats or sample material on top of potting soil in a greenhouse misting room and enumerating emerging seedlings. Seedlings from a total of 125 plant species emerged during this study (including 82 in river trawls, 89 in stationary water traps, 21 in drift lines, 39 in wind traps, and 10 in goose feces). The most abundant taxa included Bidens frondosa, Boehmeria cylindrica, Cyperus spp., Eclipta prostrata, and Ludwigia palustris, Total seedling density was significantly greater for the stationary water traps (212±30.6 seeds/m2/month) than the equal-sized stationary wind traps (18±6.0 seeds/m2/month). Lower-bound estimates of total species richness based on the non-parametric Chao 2 asymptotic estimators were greater for seeds in water (106±1.4 for stationary water traps and 104±5.5 for trawl samples) than for wind (54±6.4). Our results indicate that water is the primary source of seeds dispersing to the site and that a species-rich pool of dispersing propagules is present, an interesting result given the urbanized nature of the surrounding landscape. However, species composition of dispersing seeds differed from vegetation of restored and natural tidal freshwater marshes, indicating that planting is necessary for certain species. At other restoration sites, information on densities of dispersing seeds can support decisions on which species to plant. © 2005, The Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - <jats:p><p>Currently 40% of the world’s human population lives within 100km of a coast. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicting that sea levels will rise between 0.52 and 0.98m by 2100, and with increasing climate change induced extreme weather events affecting urban settings, the ways in which people reside in coastal areas needs to be addressed. As water levels rise, both permanently through sea level rise, and temporarily through storm surge events, areas of high population in low lying areas will have to reconsider their typical housing and infrastructure design methods, and/or their lifestyles to address this more frequent or potentially permanent influx of water into towns and cities.  Current methods of flood adaptive architecture often consider solutions at just the individual house or building scale, despite the clear need to be able to analyse and design with wider changing urban landscape conditions driving decision making. In response, this research investigates possible design strategies for adapting housing to climate change induced flooding, while enhancing the liveability of changing local community environments. This is investigated through a case study design-led research process, and is complimented by a survey of residents. The case study site is a flood prone suburb in the city of Dunedin on the east coast of the South Island in Aotearoa New Zealand.  Key findings of the research point to the importance of employing not just a purely technical approach to flooding adaptive housing, but also to using a community-led approach to re-design to understand how people will react to, use, and adapt to repurposed built environments that respond to climate change. This reinforces the need to conceive flood adaptive housing at least at a street and neighbourhood scale, and preferably at a whole suburb landscape scale, rather that just as a single housing typology solution. The research concludes that combining flood adaptive housing with ecosystem-based adaptation solutions to climate change induced flooding could lead to a different, more ecology-integrated way of living for inhabitants of low lying coastal areas. This in turn is likely to have positive social and psychological benefits for inhabitants while increasing community resilience.</p></jats:p>

AB  - Since 1982, Danish legislation on streams and drainage has included clauses which make it possible to implement river restoration. In this paper, the Danish shift in policy from drainage to the return of wetlands is described. To illustrate the new beginning on catchment management, two major river-restoration schemes, i.e. the River Brede demonstration project and the River Skjern Nature project, are presented. Both projects have been implemented and consist of many parts, including (a) returning the straight, regulated rivers back to their former meanders, (b) introducing better hydraulic interaction between the river and its meadows, and (c) establishing former lakes, bogs, ponds and marshes. Also, an increase in security against flooding has resulted, as the regulated 'water-motorways' have become more natural, with buffer-zones and retention of water in the restored features.

AB  - Eutrophication often causes hypoxia in estuarine and coastal systems, but the mechanisms that control hypoxic events vary among estuaries and are often difficult to discern. We monitored surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Upper Newport Bay (UNB), a tidally mixed estuary in Southern California subject to anthropogenic nutrient loading, eutrophication and hypoxia. Our goal was to identify the environmental factors regulating DO dynamics. Six hypoxic events occurred between June and November and were associated with a combination of low solar radiation, increased freshwater discharge following precipitation, and enhanced haline stratification during reduced tidal range periods. At the head of the estuary, high macroalgal biomass and pronounced haline stratification resulted in high DO in the surface layer and low DO in the bottom layer. Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor waters were transported clown-estuary by ebb tides, resulting in DO heterogeneity throughout the UNB. Cross-wavelet analysis illustrated the down-estuary propagation of high/low DO signal correlated with the phases of diurnal photosynthetic and semi-diurnal tidal cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Abandoned Yellow River Delta (denoted as "AYRD" hereafter) located in the north of Jiangsu Coast, China, was formed and developed during the years 1128-1855, when the old Yellow River reached the Jiangsu Coast and discharged into the south Yellow sea. Since 1855, the Yellow River has shifted its course to the Bohai Sea. The subaqueous delta was eroded due to the cut off of the sediment supply. Now, the coast of the AYRD is exposed to the wave action of the South Yellow Sea due to the lack of shelter of offshore sandbars, so the wave-induced sediment lifting effect is strong, leading to the obvious sediment resuspension in the subaqueous delta under the wave action. Based on the field data, we analyzed the law of water and sediment movement and established a twodimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport numerical model (Delft3D), coupled to the wave model to simulate the sediment transport. The results show that the suspended sediment concentration (denoted as "SSC" hereafter) is high nearshore and low offshore. During the flood tide, the sediment is transported to the south, and to the north in ebb tide, but the net transport direction is to the south, which is an important source of material in the central coast of Jiangsu. Due to the breakwater construction, the sediment transport from north to south has been intercepted, a small amount of siltation has occurred in the south and inside of the breakwater. which greatly reduces the SSC in the port area and the nearby estuaries but has little impact in the far estuaries.

AB  - Sea-level rise threatens low-lying areas around the world's coasts with increased coastal flooding during storms. One response to this challenge is to build or upgrade coastal flood defenses. This report examines the potential investment costs of such an adaptation strategy applied globally over the 21st century for sea-level rise scenarios consistent with three Representative Concentration Pathways and 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. For all the protection models considered, much less than half of the world's coast is protected. The total defense costs are significantly higher than earlier estimates, amounting to as much as US$18.3 trillion. With cost-benefit analysis, there are large uncertainties and empirical observations of protection standards are limited. Hence, the estimates should be considered as indicative, and this remains an important topic for future research. Further, building defenses is not a one-off capital investment. Over the 21st century, the cost of a comprehensive protection strategy is dominated by maintenance costs in all the cases considered in this report. This indicates that in addition to capital investment, the development of appropriate institutions and governance mechanisms to deliver maintenance, as well as the necessary funding streams, are essential for such a protection-based adaptation strategy to be effective.

AB  - During the period 1980-1990 long-term physical, chemical and ecological studies were carried out, to study the changes induced by the building of a storm-surge barrier in the mouth of the Oosterschelde estuary and two large auxiliary compartment dams in the rear ends of the estuary. The storm-surge barrier was constructed in the mouth of Oosterschelde estuary (SW Netherlands) during the period 1979-1986. The barrier allows the tides to enter the estuary freely, and, on the other hand, the barrier guarantees safety for the human population and their properties when a stormflood threatens the area. Oosterschelde estuary is isolated from the river input, the rear ends of the ecosystem were separated from the estuary by sea-walls and the strongly decreased tidal exchange with the North Sea induced sheltered circumstances. The Oosterschelde changed from a turbid estuary into a tidal bay, and yet primary production responses appear to be robust and resilient, and the biological communities showed only quantitative shifts from the dominance of specific species assemblages to other assemblages. In many cases predicted changes in the structure of the biological communities could not be verified owing to the large natural variability mainly caused by physical factors (e.g. temperature). © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - This chapter deals with the estimation of tsunami-induced hydrodynamic forces on infrastructure located in the vicinity of the shoreline. While extensive research has been conducted on the impact of hydrodynamic forces on classical coastal protection works (breakwaters, seawalls, reefs, etc.), there is limited research on their impact on structures such as buildings and bridges located inland. The devastation brought by the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on coastal communities in Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and other countries outlined the urgent need for research on the evaluation of structural resilience of infrastructure located in tsunami-prone areas. This chapter summarizes the state-ofthe- art knowledge with respect to forces generated by tsunami-induced hydraulic bores, including debris impact. Further, sample calculations of tsunami loading on a prototype structure are presented. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the implementation of the Development of Western Regions in 2000, a series of major ecological construction projects have been implemented, leading to a series of changes in the ecological conditions and ecological services of western China. This study calculated the amount of ecosystem services in total in the western region from 2000 to 2019, and analyzed ecological changes and the characteristics of spatio-temporal variations in ecological services. A relevant analysis method was applied to explore the tradeoff and synergy of service. It was found that the area of settlements and wetland ecosystems in the western region increased significantly from 2000 to 2015, whereas grassland showed a downward trend year by year. The vegetation fraction showed a decreasing belt-like distribution from south to north. It showed a fluctuating increase during 2000 to 2019, with inter-annual and large spatial differences. The water conservation service (WCS) had a slight downward trend from 2000 to 2019, and the main decreasing areas were distributed in southeastern Tibet, the western part of the Three Rivers Source region, and the karst rocky desertification area. The soil conservation service (SCS) showed an increasing but fluctuating trend, with the greatest increases observed in the Loess Plateau region, western Sichuan and Yunnan, northwest Tibet, and southeast Tibet. The windbreak and sand fixation service (SFS) showed a downward trend, and the sharp decline was mainly in the central and western parts of Inner Mongolia, Tibet and parts of northern Xinjiang. Ecosystem supply and WCS, and SCS were mainly synergistic, which were found in areas north of the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River (QM-HR) line, especially in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. Ecosystem supply was mainly tradeoffs with SFS, and it was found in the agriculture-pastoral transition zone. The synergistic degree of ecosystem services in areas subjected to ecological engineering policy was greater than that in non-engineering areas. Quantitative assessment of ecosystem service changes and their tradeoffs is helpful for scientific ecological management and maximizing ecological benefits.

AB  - An intense low-pressure system passed along coasts of Pacific Ocean side of the northern part of Japan in October 2006. High tide level was recorded, many beaches and dunes were eroded and coastal defense systems were damaged on the coasts by the low-pressure system. This high water level due to the low-pressure system continued for over 24 hours with big wind waves and met astronomical high tide a few times. The results of numerical simulations shown in this paper confirm us that Ekman transport was the main physical force to generate this high tide level. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The movement of water along a vertical scale draws attention to the subtle realities of topography and the consequential horizontal extent of flooding. During a flood, the section gives rise to new configurations and understandings of the city. Today, flooding has become associated with the impact of global sea level rise, and the threat of rising waters has taken on a new sense of urgency. Studying the planar transformation that takes place during a time of high water is an opportunity to reinvent and redesign the 21st-century city, and to consider new notions of urban and ecological development. We are particularly interested in questioning both the notion and the effectiveness of "hard infrastructure," exemplified by seawalls and storm surge barriers. These reduce the zone of floodwater absorption to a singular line in plan and a singular wall in section. We propose the development of a new strategic approach toward flooding that we call "soft infrastructure"- multiple and iterative strategies that buffer or absorb flooding. These strategies operate at the merged surface of the land's topography and the water's bathymetry, or in the shallow flats below the water. We envision the water's edge as a fluid and temporal limit between the water and the land. Our analyses include computational hydrodynamic and hazard models to predict flooding and their consequences in the New York and New Jersey harbor region.

AB  - Bayside bulkheads on Great South Bay, New York at Fire Island National Seashore are evaluated to determine their impact on unprotected areas adjacent to them and to identify alternatives for future protection from coastal erosion. Bulkheads extend along about 18% of the 67.3 km-long shoreline. Annual topographic surveys conducted 2004-2008 at four bulkheads and two control sites reveal that annual retreat can be as great as 3.3 m yr(-1) in the upland and 6 m yr(-1) on the foreshore. Local bulkhead-influenced sand starvation appears to extend up to 68 m alongshore. Sand starvation due to bulkheads is only one aspect of the erosion problem. Lack of fresh inputs of sediment to the bayshore by inlets, overwash and dune migration all contribute to shoreline transgression. Beach nourishment can restore the sediment budget in places but should be introduced in a way that minimizes burial of benthic habitat or creation of large scale exotic environments. The inherent dynamism of natural systems and the adaptation of species to this dynamism prevent restoration of landforms or habitats to stable target states. The closest approximation of a "permanent" solution would be to restore the sediment budget by creating feeder uplands by placing fill sediment at about the height of local natural formations and close to bulkhead ends. Dredging of navigation channels appears to provide a ready source of compatible fill.

AB  - A hydrodynamic approach is used to determine whether tsunami- or cyclone-generated waves were responsible for the deposition of fields of well-imbricated rock boulders (up to 290 tonnes) along the coast of Cairns inside the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Calculations of the overturning moments show that only tsunami are capable of moving such large boulders in this environment. It is hypothesised that large tsunami (> 11 m) have been able to penetrate the Great Barrier Reef through wide (5-10 km) 50-70 m deep passages between individual reefs. Three such passages each approximately 35 km apart and oriented in the same direction exist in the Cairns region. It is possible that these passages have funnelled and amplified palaeotsunamis. The preferential location of eroded coral boulders up to 3 m in length on reef flats alongside these passages and their absence on other reefs throughout the region provide further evidence that extremely high-energy waves have been able to penetrate the Great Barrier Reef into the inner channel adjacent to the mainland. Carbon-14 ages of the coral boulders on these reef flats matches closely the ages of coral fragments pinned below the very large rock boulders along the coast. These ages suggest that the Cairns region has experienced large tsunami twice over the last millennium.

AB  - As the world faces an increasing number of both natural and social disasters, attempts to support disaster risk reduction are also increasing. Although there is a general rule to calculate the disaster risk on an area based on the components of hazard, vulnerability, and capacity, disaster risk studies result in a number of disaster risk models which present different characteristics in terms of the number of components involved, indicators, and the calculations. This poses a difficulty for disaster analysts to choose the most appropriate model to calculate the disaster risk of an area. Moreover, they often need to adapt the existing models or even to create new models in order to provide the most suitable way of calculating the disaster risks. Therefore, a mechanism that enables the use of different kinds of disaster risk model and the creation of new models is required. This paper presents a metamodel of disaster risk based on a study on a number of disaster risk models used in Indonesia: The BNPB (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana) disaster risk model, the volcanic disaster risk model using SMART (Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique) method, and the tidal flooding disaster risk model using fuzzy method. The metamodel is presented in an entity-relationship model. It is basically a spatial data model since the components and indicators for the calculation of disaster risks are always associated to the space on earth. The metamodel is implemented on top of ArcGIS software. Using Phyton Add-in, the software is adapted by adding new functionalities to calculate the disaster risk of an area and to create new disaster risk models. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The productivity of biological resources in coastal Louisiana is at risk because of Gulf shoreline changes. Most estuarine species depend on Gulf shores and barrier islands for nesting, food, or shelter and will be directly affected by habitat loss. Others have complex indirect relationships with the shoreline ecosystem. Forecasting the degree of impact on all animals that are indirectly affected by shoreline change cannot be done with any degree of certainty. However, it is possible to evaluate and attempt to quantify the effects of changes in environmental factors that drive the distribution and abundance of commercial, keystone, and endangered species. Our objective was to provide an overview of habitat associations and environmental concerns for these significant animal species. For example, many important commercial species in Louisiana-such as blue crabs, Gulf menhaden, and various shrimp species-move among coastal habitats to complete parts of their life cycles. If the movement of these animals from the Gulf through tidal passes into estuarine nursery habitats is altered by shoreline changes, then populations of these species will be put at risk. Likewise, populations of keystone species, such as the common Rangia clam and the American oyster, will be affected if shoreline loss leads to changes in salinity conditions. Finally, most of Louisiana's threatened and endangered coastal species-such as sea turtles, brown pelicans, piping plovers, and Gulf sturgeon-rely on vulnerable barrier island habitats. Information on estuarine invertebrates, fishes, and other coastal animals is provided so that restoration of essential habitats can be incorporated into coastal management activities.

AB  - This study describes a novel system of compressed air generation using a pendulum wave energy converter installed in a coastal defense structure. The objective of this study is to understand how much energy from the incoming waves can be captured for use by the system. Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of wave and system load conditions on energy conversion efficiency and wave reflection. The test results show that the system can operate with a high degree of efficiency under standing wave and high-load conditions. A reduction of wave reflection can be achieved by the system under a wide range of wave conditions.

AB  - Summary Located in the western half of New Guinea, Papua is facing rapid and poorly-planned social and economic development, increasing habitat degradation and threatening its high level of species richness and endemicity. Freshwater ecosystems, more than any other biotope in Papua, face the worst consequences from human development through sedimentation, habitat alteration, pollution, and the introduction of exotic species. However, little research has been conducted on the impact of human activities on aquatic species, and specifically fish in lentic and lotic ecosystems, in Papua.  Lake Sentani is located in northern Papua, near Jayapura, the capital of Papua Province. It is the largest lowland lake in Papua, and plays a critical role in the survival of the humans and organisms living in and around it. Human activities are negatively affecting its local flora and fauna, especially those with very narrow distributions, such as the rainbowfishes, Chilatherina sentaniensis and Glossolepis incisus, and the Sentani Goby (Glossogobius sp.). The lake is located close to an urban center and heavy development occurs in the north, east, and northeast, while other threats include non-point pollution of human activities, habitat alteration along the shoreline, and introduced species. Despite these concerns, and its proximity to the local government, the lake has received no attention in terms conserving its ecosystem. Moreover, although there is some research on the mollusks, phytoplankton, limnological aspects, and water quality of the lake, none exists specifically on the correlation between human activities and the lake’s inhabitants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document the ecology of the Red Rainbowfish (Glossolepis incisus), one of the threatened endemic fishes in Lake Sentani, and the impact of human activities on its habitats. Specifically, this study was designed to focus on the impact of human activities on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish, its body length, and sex ratio, and the abundance of introduced fishes and correlation between their abundance and Red Rainbowfish abundance. Assessing the impact of human activities was done by measuring eight water physicochemical parameters that were reported to have the most potential influence on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish, in nine locations from three zones. The zones were predetermined based on visual assessments of the level of human activities, where higher numbers of people were assumed to have higher impacts on the environment. Zone I’s locations had heavy human activity, Zone II’s locations had medium human activity, and Zone III’s locations had the lowest human activity and was considered a “control area”. These zones’ locations were later regrouped following analyses of the water physicochemical parameters.  Fish and water samples were collected along the shoreline, at depths of up to two meters. Fish were sampled in the morning at each sampling site of a single location, and replicated three times on alternate days, yielding 27 data sets for each zone, or 81 data sets for all three zones within a year, and a total 243 data sets in three years. Collected rainbowfish were differentiated by sex, counted, measured, and released. Water parameters were measured in the same sites in which fish sampling was conducted, three times a day—morning (06.00–09.00 am), midday (11.00 am–13.00 pm), and afternoon (16.00–18.00 pm)—and repeated three times in each sampling site on three alternate days. Thus, a total of 81 water parameter data sets were collected. Water parameters, including nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand were analyzed in a laboratory, while water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were directly measured in the field. Then, the ecology of the rainbowfish was descriptively analyzed to assess the preferred habitat of the fish, including substrate type, water depth, turbidity, and vegetation. The R statistical analysis program was used to analyze the water physicoche ical parameters in order to determine the level of pollution in the water, abundance of Red Rainbowfish in each sampling group, and correlation between water physicochemical parameters and Red Rainbowfish abundance and body size. After the level of water pollution was determined, fish samples were arranged into three groups based on the level of pollution in their location. The Analysis Toolpak in Microsoft Excel 2007, and SPSS version 17.0 were used to calculate Red Rainbowfish body length for each group, as well as the difference between groups, correlation between Red Rainbowfish abundance and introduced fish abundance, and Red Rainbowfish abundance and nitrate concentration.  Based on the aforementioned water physicochemical parameters, the sampling sites were distinguished into three groups: Groups 1 and 2 indicated heavy pollution (human impact) and Group 3 indicated low pollution (human impact) with fairly good water quality. There were significant differences in certain physicochemical parameters between groups, specifically in nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, BOD, and COD. Group 1 had the highest concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, while Group 2 had the highest concentrations of phosphate, BOD and COD. Group 3 had the best water quality of the three groups, with low to medium concentrations of each parameter. Phosphate levels in all three groups exceeded the Indonesian government’s phosphate limit in drinking water and fisheries, with BOD and COD. Nitrate and nitrite were both still within the limit. No area with zero human impact was found, even in sites with a  population as low as two people. These results indicate that Lake Sentani already suffers from a high level of organic matter, which enters the lake as the result of human activities around it.  Red Rainbowfish abundance was not different between groups, except when fish were counted based on their sex. Male abundance remained similar across groups, whereas female abundance was similar in Groups 1 and 2, but much lower in Group 3.  Nitrate was the only water parameter significantly correlating negatively with Red Rainbowfish abundance, suggesting that increased nitrate levels had an effect in decreasing fish abundance in Lake Sentani, although the impact was still low. Red Rainbowfish body length was significantly different between groups, with Group 3 having the longest mean body length. Phosphate was the only parameter found to contribute to Red Rainbowfish body length, albeit non-significantly.  Introduced fish abundance correlated weakly with Red Rainbowfish abundance. While Group 2 showed a weak negative correlation, Group 1 and Group 3 revealed a weak positive correlation, suggesting that, whether positive or negative, introduced fish species had a very low influence on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish.  Male Red Rainbowfish were more abundant than females in the shallow waters along the shoreline, the latter being found more commonly in deeper waters. This ratio was similar in Groups 1 and 2, whereas Group 3, whose habitats were the least polluted, had a higher ratio of males. The disparity in sex ratio was possibly caused by their different habitat preferences, as well as light and temperature preferences.  The overall habitat preference of the Red Rainbowfish was clear, shallow water, sand, gravel, and cobble substrate, and shoaling amidst Hydrilla verticillata, Valisneria americana, Eichhornia crassipes, Metroxylon sagu, and grasses. The availability of food also attracted fish to certain areas, such as under traditional stilt houses, roots of some plants, litter, and wood debris. The pollen of terrestrial plants, as well as terrestrial insects, also served as a food source for the fish, along with the larvae of aquatic insects and algae. Roots of plants were also important for refuge, and as nursery and playing grounds. Moreover, the fish avoided high light intensities by moving to shaded areas or deeper water. These factors influenced the Red Rainbowfish’s distribution and habitat selection, and consequently, its abundance.  H man activities in and around Lake Sentani have impacted the quality of its habitats and water. Although water quality did not have a significant influence on the Red Rainbowfish, owing to its ability to adapt to changes in water quality, changes to its habitat will have a significant impact on its ability to survive in Lake Sentani. The outcome of the present rate of pollution of its water will be further and more serious deterioration of its ecosystem, force its inhabitants to compete for increasingly fewer resources, and ultimately result in the extinction of its endemic species, of which the Red Rainbowfish is just one example. Therefore, Lake Sentani should be made a priority in Papuan conservation and management efforts, especially for native and endemic species.  The results of this study provide baseline data for Red Rainbowfish conservation in Lake Sentani, and will allow policy-makers to pursue the protection of its habitats, create a strategy to control pollutants, and encourage community-based environmental management. Further research is needed on the correlation between the Red Rainbowfish and its preferences, and its susceptibility to certain types and concentrations of pollutants. Different strategies of pollution control should also be investigated. Other parts of Lake Sentani that were beyond the scope of this research should also be surveyed, along with a lake-wide program examining the exact condition of Lake Sentani’s ecosystem, whether it be the quality of its water or the response of its flora and fauna to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance, after which a more comprehensive rehabilitation program may follow.

AB  - The history of the coastal engineering activity in Portugal since 1964, the date of the last ICCE to be held in Lisbon, is briefly summarized. A difficult task indeed due to the time span of 40 years to be dealt with. The characterization of the country economical evolution, concerning coastal activities, is first tried by means of a set of growth indicators. The advances in the knowledge of some basic aspects, such as wave climate and littoral sediment transport in Portuguese coasts, arc highlighted. The developments on coastal erosion, coastal protection and on the construction of coastal structures (breakwaters) are exemplified by means of some relevant case studies. The development of the scientific infrastructure is also very briefly presented.

AB  - The objective of the present work is to evaluate the down wave conditions and the coastal impact induced by a hybrid wave-wind farm that would operate close to the Sardinia Island in the Mediterranean Sea. The target area was selected in the vicinity of Porto Ferro, which is located in the northern part of the island. Considering the most relevant environmental patterns, SWAN model simulations have been performed in order to assess the possible impact of the marine power plant. As regards the hybrid farm considered, it can be mentioned that this is located in the center of the target area and it is developed around some WindFloat offshore wind turbines. Such kind of floating wind turbines are already operational, both in the North Sea and in the Iberian nearshore. For the present study, a number of 11 floating platforms were considered, the spatial configuration of the farm being designed according to the standard prescriptions of the wind turbine manufacturer. Furthermore, a generic wave farm was considered to be implemented over a distance of 3.5 km at about 500 m up wave the wind farm. The most important conclusion coming from the present work is that the future marine power plants, besides extracting renewable energy, can play also an active role in coastal protection.

AB  - Excavation of sulfidic materials during construction has resulted in acid rock drainage (ARD) problems on disturbed lands throughout much of Virginia. In particular, exposure of sulfide-bearing Tertiary marine sediments in the Coastal Plain has become increasingly prevalent. Once exposed, these sediments rapidly produce acid sulfate soils which do not readily support vegetation. To date, the most extensive case of acid sulfate weathering problems in the Coastal Plain occurs at Stafford Regional Airport (SRAP) in Stafford, Virginia. Field plots were established at SRAP in 2002 to evaluate a variety of amendments for remediation and revegetation of acid sulfate soils. The plots were constructed in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 4 replications per treatment. Prior to treatment, surface (0–15cm) soil samples were collected from all plots to determine pH and peroxide potential acidity (PPA). Treatments included two rates of lime-stabilized biosolids (184 and 92 Mg ha -1 ) with small amounts of additional lime to achieve calcium carbonate equivalences (CCE) of 53 and 27 Mg ha -1 , two rates of lime (47 and 23 Mg ha -1 CCE) with N, P, and K fertilizers, yardwaste compost (101 Mg ha -1 ) with lime (24 Mg ha -1 CCE) and P and K fertilizers, and a control. The plots were seeded with a mix of acidand salt-tolerant grasses. Soil and vegetation samples were collected in duplicate from each plot after 1 and 2 years. No significant differences were observed among the amended treatments for surface soil pH, surface soil EC, or vegetation production for either of the sampling dates, indicating that all of the tested amendment combinations were effective in stabilizing these materials.

AB  - Recently reported increased water depths and greater wave heights, perhaps associated with increased storminess, are likely to lead to more active changes, such as increased beach erosion, faster shoreline migration and sediment redistribution. A coastal environment particularly sensitive to the impact of sea-level rise is that of highly erodible cliffs and scarps. As structures are often built close to such formations, it is important to determine the retreat rate of cliffs and scarps. Among other things, knowing the retreat rate can help regulators plan coastal protection measures and can help property owners decide where to place their structures to avoid damage. The principal objective of the current study is to find and analyze the retreat rate of cliffs and scarps in several locations along the Estonian coast. Variable geological conditions, exposure to the sea and human influence are considered. It was found that, the fastest rate of retreat appears on the location where the softest sediments are exposed to the roughest wave conditions -- in Cape Kiipsaare

AB  - Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges in current environmental policy. Appropriate policies intended to stimulate efficient adaptation and mitigation should not exclusively rely on the assumption of the homo oeconomicus, but take advantage of well-researched alternative behavioural patterns. Prospect theory provides a number of climate-relevant insights, such as the notion that evaluations of outcomes are reference dependent, and the relevance of perceived certainty of outcomes. This paper systematically reviews what prospect theory can offer to analyse mitigation and adaptation. It is shown that accounting for reference dependence and certainty effects contributes to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including (but not limited to) the different uptake of mitigation and adaptation amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation. Finally, concrete possibilities for empirical research on these effects are proposed.

AB  - Problem Statement: Even though bioengineering technique has been regarded as one way to alleviate landslide and erosion problems, this process of revegetation is severely time consuming as the process of plant succession of the slopes may take decades or even hundreds of years. Approach: However, the process can be tremendously hastened by planting the right suitable pioneer species on the slopes. In this project, a natural succession experiment was conducted to determine the role of a potential slope colonizer, L. leucocephala, as a good pioneer in two years of observation. Results: In terms of the plant community, L. leucocephala had tremendously accelerated the plant succession of the slope. Within two years, 46 species comprising various species of grasses, shrubs and small trees colonized in the mixed culture treatment. The plant diversity increased drastically, about five (12 months) and eight fold (24 months) of its initial (0 month) diversity against 2.5 (12 months) and three fold (24 months) in the monoculture treatment. Related to this species-richness, LAI and biomass of the plant community was also enhanced in the mix-culture system. Conclusion: The results indicate that the species studied exhibits an outstanding pioneering characteristic by enhancing natural succession and the revegetation process which will be in turn, resulting in a more stable ecosystem.

AB  - Nearly 30% of the coastline of Malaysia is undergoing erosion. Many of these areas are coastal mudflats,fringed by mangroves. Behind the mangroves there are usually agricultural areas that are protected by bunds from tidal inundation. These bunds are constructed by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage and it is the policy of the department to maintain a strip of mangroves between the bunds and the sea. Mangroves are known to reduce wave energy as waves travel through them. Thus, mangroves are used to protect the bunds from eroding. However, mangroves themselves are susceptible to erosion. Finding the best method in using this natural system of coastal protection is therefore important to the Department of Irrigation and Drainage. This paper looks at the various methods of using the systems developed to date.

AB  - The lagoon of Ghar El Melh and its annex, the lagoon of Sidi Ali El Mekki, belong to the coast of the Gulf of Tunis and are the remains of the old bay of Utica which represented an open Coastal Bay in the Mediterranean Sea in the 2nd century A.D (JAUZEIN, 1971; SLIM et al., 2004). Their barrier beach, or lido, is today facing major problems. The starting point was the creation in 1974 of a small fishing harbor which has deregulated the sediment dynamics along the shore. The morphology of the lido has been heavily modified and disturbances took place in the hydrological dynamics. The effects were also felt in the agricultural activity conducted on the banks of the lagoon system, including Ramli terroir resulting from an original soil use and which is of great importance to the agricultural heritage and the local patrimony. This technique consists to create farmland by a form of polders gained at the expanse of the lagoon and its wetlands. Plants are irrigated from their roots thanks to the movements, following tides, of a freshwater lens that forms in the artificial soil. The question is all the more important as the lagoon system is threatened by maritimisation and the changes in the lido morphology are accompanied by social problems and also by the lack of clear efforts that can save this land and ensure its sustainability.

AB  - This study was a collaborating project between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, and the Prince George’s County, Maryland. The project was performed under a contract with Advanced Technology Systems, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as part of the environmental restoration to the Patuxent watershed. The primary objective of this project was to create wetland features in the Willow Hills Storm Water Management pond without adversely impacting its flood control capability. Specifically, the study was to incorporate a sedimentation forebay and through flow shallow marsh wetland in the pond. The study approach was to provide the surface area require d for the modifications and still preserve the total available storage. The proposed retrofit has five zones: a sedimentation zone, reed bed zone, littoral zone, open water zone, and riparian zone. The designed modifications include regrading the sides fro m about 2.5:1 to 2:1 slopes, excavating a portion of the base and filling other parts of the base to accommodate the different zones. The total excavation and filling were designed to be equal to maintain the total capacity of the pond. A TR-20 modeling was conducted to check the project performance, as related to the peak flows for 2-, 5-, and 100-year floods. The modified pond would cause the peak flow for the 2 -year storm to be reduced by 8.4%, and the reduction becomes smaller for the higher flood event s. A detailed cost estimate, using MCACES, was developed for the proposed modifications.

AB  - Abstract. Mangroves have a lot of economic and ecological advantages which include coastal protection, habitat for wildlife, fisheries and forestry products. Determination of the extent of mangrove patches in the coastal areas of the Philippines is therefore important especially in resource conservation, protection and management. This starts with a well-defined and accurate map. LiDARwas used in the mangrove extraction in the different coastal areas of Negros Occidental in Western Visayas, Philippines. Total coastal study area is 1,082.55 km² for the 14 municipalities/ cities processed. Derivatives that were used in the extraction include, DSM, DTM, Hillshade, Intensity, Number of Returns and PCA. The RGB bands of the Orthographic photographs taken at the same time with the LiDAR data were also used as one of the layers during the processing. NDVI, GRVI and Hillshade using Canny Edge Layer were derived as well to produce an enhanced segmentation. Training and Validation points were collected through field validation and visual inspection using Stratified Random Sampling. The points were then used to feed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on tall structures. Only four classes were used, namely, Built-up, Mangroves, Other Trees and Sugarcane. Buffering and contextual editing were incorporated to reclassify the extracted mangroves. Overall accuracy assessment is at 98.73% (KIA of 98.24%) while overall accuracy assessment for Mangroves only is at 98.00%. Using this workflow, mangroves can already be extracted in a large-scale level with acceptable overall accuracy assessments.

AB  - Depositional units preserved on coastal plains worldwide are an important repository of information about large-scale climate change that has occurred during more than 20 Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. In general, the lateral and vertical complexity of these depositional units and their response to climatic and sea-level change are poorly understood, making it difficult to place historical and anticipated future climate and sea-level change in a natural geologic context. Mapping Quaternary siliciclastic depositional units on low-relief coastal plains historically has been based on aerial photographs. Accuracy and detail have been hindered, however, by lack of exposure and low relief. High-resolution airborne lidar surveys, along with surface and borehole geophysical measurements, are being used to identify lateral and vertical boundaries of stratigraphic units on the Texas Coastal Plain within upper Quaternary strata. Ground and borehole conductivity measurements discriminate sandy barrier island and fluvial and deltaic channel deposits from muddy floodplain, delta-plain, and estuarine deposits. Borehole conductivity and natural gamma logs similarly distinguish distinct depositional units in the subsurface and identify erosional unconformities and soil horizons that likely separate units deposited during different glacialinterglacial cycles. High-resolution digital elevation models obtained from airborne lidar surveys reveal previously unrecognized topographic detail that greatly aids mapping of subtle surface features such as sandy channels, interchannel deposits, and accretionary features on barrier islands that formed during the last interglacial period. An optimal mapping approach for coastal-plain environments employs (1) an initial lidar survey to produce a detailed elevation model; (2) selective surface sampling and geophysical measurements based on preliminary mapping derived from lidar data and aerial imagery; and (3) borehole sampling, logging, and analysis at key sites selected after lidar and surface measurements are complete.

AB  - Metal contamination of estuaries is a severe environmental problem, for which phytoremediation is gaining momentum. In particular, the associations between halophytes-autochthonous rhizobacteria have proven useful for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes. In this work, three bacterial strains (gram-negative and gram positive) were used for Spartina densiflora inoculation. All three bacteria, particularly Pantoea strains, promoted plant growth and mitigated metal stress on polluted sediments, as revealed from functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus (PSII) and maintenance of nutrient balance. Pantoea strains did not significantly affect metal accumulation in plant roots, whereas the Bacillus strain enhanced it. Metal loading to shoots depended on particular elements, although in all cases it fell below the threshold for animal consumption. Our results confirm the possibility of modulating plant growth and metal accumulation upon selective inoculation, and the suitability of halophyte-rhizobacteria interactions as biotechnological tools for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes, preventing metal transfer to the food chain.

AB  - Nearly half a million miles of pipeline transporting natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids crisscross the United States. While an efficient and fundamentally safe means of transport, many pipelines carry materials with the potential to cause public injury and environmental damage. The nation's pipeline networks are also widespread and vulnerable to accidents and terrorist attack. Recent pipeline accidents in Marshall, MI, San Bruno, CA, Allentown, PA, and Laurel, MT, have heightened congressional concern about pipeline risks and drawn criticism from the National Transportation Safety Board. Both government and industry have taken numerous steps to improve pipeline safety and security over the last 10 years. Nonetheless, while many stakeholders agree that federal pipeline safety programs have been on the right track, the spate of recent pipeline incidents suggest there continues to be significant room for improvement. Likewise, the threat of terrorist attack remains a concern. The federal pipeline safety program is authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-90) which was signed by President Obama on January 3, 2012. The act contains a broad range of provisions addressing pipeline safety and security. Among the most significant are provisions that could increase the number of federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves for transmission pipelines, mandate verification of maximum allowable operating pressure for gas transmission pipelines, increase civil penalties for pipeline safety violations, and mandate reviews of diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2011 (H.R. 3011) would mandate a study regarding the relative roles and responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation with respect to pipeline security. As it oversees the federal pipeline safety program and the federal role in pipeline security, Congress may wish to assess how the various elements of U.S. pipeline safety and security fit together in the nation's overall strategy to protect transportation infrastructure. Pipeline safety and security necessarily involve many groups: federal agencies, oil and gas pipeline associations, large and small pipeline operators, and local communities. Reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Florida has an intense climate with periods of frequent and heavy rainfall and highly permeable sand soils which have little ability to retain nutrients or water. These factors provide cultural and environmental management challenges for landscape management. Urbanization and land use changes near coastal areas have been shown to degrade water quality. In an effort to reduce fertilizer-based nutrient pollution from urban areas, various programs are promoting alternative landscape materials, which require less input than traditional turfgrass vegetation. Although landscapes that utilize various plant materials that require traditional inputs may conceivably reduce nutrient pollution from urban landscapes, this idea remains unresolved. Here we use a replicated field experiment to show that P and K pollution via leaching was greater on a mixed-species ornamental landscape than a turfgrass monoculture during establishment and routine plant maintenance.

AB  - The Water Act 1989 was passed by Parliament and the National Rivers Authority was established with a duty to oversee river management and regulation, and with strong environmental responsibility. Flood including sea defence became the responsibility of the NRA and as with the Water Authorities the function is discharged through regional and local committees, now called Flood Defence Committees. In 1990 the Law Commission embarked on a consolidation of legislation relating to water. Flood defence legislation, in the Land Drainage Act 1976 and the Water Act 1989, was re-enacted in the Land Drainage Act 1991 and the Water Resources Act 1991. A short summary is presented to provide the context. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has policy responsibility in England for flood defence (defined as the prevention of flooding of land by rivers or the sea) and, since 1985, coast protection (defined as the protection of land from erosion or encroachment by the sea). In Wales the Secretary of State for Wales holds the equivalent responsibility. (from Author)

AB  - The delta of the Mississippi River is in jeopardy. it is rapidly subsiding into the Gulf of Mexico. Delta marshland is being drowned and the shoreline is moving northward toward New Orleans. The cause of these problems is the levee system along the Mississippi River, which prevents the replenishment of sediment to the delta. One way to restore the delta is through the use of one or more controlled partial avulsions of the Mississippi River. The design of such diversions represents a monumental task. A natural example of an avulsion in the Mississippi Delta, however, offers an excellent opportunity to test the concept of land building via river diversions. The Atchafalaya River is a distributary of the Mississippi River. During the flood of 1973, part of the Atchafalaya River avulsed into a man-made channel. The Wax Lake Delta at the mouth of the channel has been building seaward since then. Here a morphodynamic model of the Wax Lake Delta is presented and tested against field data. While the model is preliminary, the fact that it captures the process of land building at the Wax Lake Delta suggests that it can be adapted to the design of a major controlled partial avulsion of the Mississippi River into, for example, Barataria Bay.

AB  - Accurate and reliable benthic quality indicators are in great demand following the recent developments and the strict time schedule for implementing the European Water Framework Directive. The Mondego estuary has experienced a progressive deterioration during the 1990s, followed by a partial ecological recovery clue to restoration measures in 1997/1998. We have used the estuary as a model system to test the performance and robustness of a set of ecological indicators in highlighting the changes in the ecological state of intertidal areas. Over a period of 17 years (1985-2002), we calculated Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, Taxonomic Distinctness measures, AZTI's Marine Biotic Index, Infaunal Trophic Index, and Eco-Exergy based indices and tested differences across periods characterised by different anthropogenic disturbance. We combined temporal data within three periods: before, during and after disturbance, based on progressive information on the changes in the extended type of anthropogenic disturbance. Indices were then compared with biological and abiotic descriptors (macroalgae, macrophytes, benthic macrofauna, nutrients concentration, sediment grain size and total organic carbon). We found great disparity in the indicators ability to capture temporal changes, showing distinct performances at each site. At the Zostera noltii site, only Margalef, Total Taxonomic Distinctness and the thermodynamically based indices Captured temporal changes, despite giving higher Values during the disturbance period. At the bare sediment site, Taxonomic Distinctness, ITI, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, AMBI and the TBI were able to distinguish between periods, in agreement with the differences observed analysing the macrobenthic assemblages. Furthermore, Taxonomic Distinctness was not robust enough to detect any temporal or spatial change. We thus Suggest further research to understand the behaviour of ecological indicators, in view of their crucial importance for the management and protection of marine coastal areas.

AB  - Recent events like the Xynthia (2010, France) storm illustrate the potentially devastating effect that storm surges can have on the coasts. Nearshore storm surges at the result mainly from two processes: atmospheric surges and wave setup. This paper investigate the relative wave setup contribution in the storm surge signal for energetic events and focusing on two cases: an open beach (Truc Vert beach, France) and a high island protected by a reef lagoon (Tubuai, French Polynesia). The two selected events are the Johanna storm (March'08), for the Truc Vert site, and the Oli cyclone (February' 10), for Tubuai. The data analysis shows that the maximum total storm surge reaches 1.2 m on the Truc Vert site and 1.1 m in the Tubuai lagoon. On the Truc Vert beach, the ECORS'08 in-situ measurements allow estimating a wave setup contribution of 80% of the total storm surge, at the time of maximum storm surge. The relative contribution of the wave setup is investigated a bit further, using the modeling approach. The modeling relies on the joint use of a shallow-water (MARS 2DH) and wave (SWAN) models. It shows an heterogeneous distribution of the wave setup in the Tubuai lagoon and a longshore variability close to the waterline for Truc Vert (~ 30%). In both cases, the wave setup contribution to the whole storm surge is predominant, with relative values ranging from 71 to 120% of the total maximal storm surge. Values larger than 100% occur on the Tubuai site when the atmospheric storm surge is negative.

AB  - Eight strains of obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, chitinolytic bacteria were isolated from the sediment of an estuarine environment. The isolates were rod-shaped, Gram-negative, and formed terminal spherical spores that swelled the sporangium. The major products from the fermentation of chitin were: acetate, ethanol, formate, CO2, H2 and ammonia. Growth of the isolates was possible at pH values ranging from 5.0–9.0. During the fermentation of chitin, N-acetylglucosamine accumulated in the culture fluids and was not metabolized. No organic compounds other than chitin and its oligomers could be demonstrated to support growth of the isolates. Hydrolysis of chitin proceeded at a relatively low rate and was incomplete. Approximately 65% of the initial amount of chitin was hydrolyzed during a period of 5–10 days. Supplementation of the medium with yeast extract, casamino acids or peptone did not enhance the rate of chitin hydrolysis, but reducing agents such as Na2S2O4 and Ti (III)-NTA markedly stimulated the rate of chitin fermentation. The ecological implications of the high degree of substrate specialization are discussed.

AB  - Forests play an important role in protecting the coastal environment by slowing down the wind speed and fixing the soil. With the aid of Remote Sensing technology, the monitoring and analysis of the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the coastal protection forests can provide useful and near real-time information for better forest construction and management in such areas. One major issue in previous studies was the somewhat subjective selection of the indicators when establishing the models for evaluating the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the protection forests, which made the research results less convincing and less reliable. Moreover, the analysis of the relationships between the indicators and effects of the evaluation models was also seldom reported. To overcome the aforementioned weakness of previous research, this present paper, taking Haitan Island, China, as study area, presented a new and detailed procedure for indicator selection for coastal protection forests' wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects evaluation and monitoring. Data used for the present study included: one Landsat 7 ETM+ image and one Landsat 8 OLI image, a DEM image with a spatial resolution of 5 meters and the meteorological data of the study area. According to a comprehensive literature survey, six most applicable indicators for the study area, namely, Climate Erosion Force (CE), Bare Sand Area Ratio (BS), Soil Adjust Vegetation Index (SAVI), Surface Roughness (SR), Soil Moisture (SM), and Soil Erodibility (SE) were selected. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Stepwise Regression Analysis (SRA) were applied to determine the weights for the six different indicators and to construct the evaluation model. By using the established evaluation model, the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the coastal protection forests of the study area in 2002 and 2013 were computed, compared and analyzed.

AB  -. The short-term effect of elevated water temperatures (Δ t = 5–10°C after passing through the cooling circuit of an electricity generating plant) on plankton in a warm temperate estuary. South Africa, was investigated. Phytoplankton entrained on the flood tide was more severely affected than that entrained on the ebb, but chlorination of cooling water was probably a major factor affecting phytoplankton assemblages. Abundance of zooplankton of marine origin was significantly reduced after passing through the cooling circuit. The effect of thermal stress on the curyhalinc zooplankton was not clear, as the origin of the water canal to the generators is located at the extreme seaward limit of spatial distribution of cstuarinc plankton at low tide. Estuarinc species of zooplankton were therefore infrequently sampled and in low numbers only. Other factors which increase mortality are discussed.

AB  - The York River has nine tidal wetland community types that are distributed along gradients of salinity and tidal inundation. These range from the Saltmarsh Cordgrass community dominated by Spartina alterniflora to the Tidal Freshwater Mixed community that can have over 50 species in one marsh. These tidal marshes provide a number of important functions and values to the estuarine systems including: high primary productivity, important habitat value, erosion buffering and filtering capacity useful for trapping sediments, pollutants and nutrients. The tidal marsh communities within the four Chesapeake Bay Virginia National Estuarine Research Reserve sites are situated along the York system in polyhaline, mesohaline, oligohaline and freshwater salinity regimes. They are largely pristine vegetation communities and have been documented to have abundant fauna characteristic of their individual community types. Changes in the vegetation communities of each site have been documented over time; however more research is needed on the potential effects of projected sea level rise on these habitats and the roles of watershed sedimentation and nutrient enrichment, vegetation succession, and invasive species on the persistence and value of these tidal marsh areas.

AB  - Extensive greenhouse studies using intact cores of marsh vegetation including Spartina alterniflora demonstrated the potential of a shoreline cleaner (Corexit 9580) to remove oil from plant canopy. Because of these positive results, a permit to conduct a full-scale field test was obtained by Louisiana State from regulatory agencies in June 1995. Field tests were conducted in a Louisiana marsh at a wildlife refuge in August 1995. The test site contained replicated 8ft × 8ft test plots that included the following treatments: oiled with South Louisiana crude oil, oiled and chemically cleaned after 2 days using Corexit 9580, and control. Significant initial reductions in plant stomatal conductance, transpiration, and CO 2 fixation rates in response to the "oil" and "oil + Corexit 9580" treatments were noted, which were followed by substantial recovery in the "oil + Corexit 9580" treatment. Use of the cleaner improved the survival and regeneration capability of treated plots because of the low initial mortality rates and the rapid restoration of plant gas exchange activities. Plots treated with "oil + Corexit 9580" had a significantly greater number of live shoots throughout the measurement period in 1995. Biomass harvests conducted at the end of the 1995 growing season revealed that live biomass per unit area of marsh was significantly reduced under all treatments. The second harvest in 1996 indicated that live biomass had recovered to levels close to those of control plots. Our field studies demonstrated that oil can be removed using Corexit 9580 in the field without any detectable adverse effects on plants. In addition, the beneficial effects of Corexit 9580 in rapidly restoring plant transpiration pathways under field conditions was evident. However, plants under all treatments recovered, showing that Spartina alterniflora, given adequate time, can recover from oiling with South Louisiana crude. Additional studies using more stressful oil types such as Bunker C are needed to examine the effectiveness of Corexit 9580 in cleaning plant canopies under field conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Natural resources along the shoreline of a tidal estuary were injured by oiling and physical disturbance following the accidental release of No. 6 fuel oil from a power plant in New Jersey, USA. Operation of heavy equipment on the shoreline during the emergency response entrained oil into sediments and physically damaged shoreline vegetation dominated by the low-value specie Phragmites australis. In response to this incident, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and the responsible party (RP) conducted a cooperative natural resource damage assessment (NRDA). During NRDA discussions, the NJDEP proposed that compensatory restoration for injured natural resources be provided at a ratio of 3:1 (restored-to-injured) based on the acreage of physically impacted vegetation. Since in-kind restoration of Phragmites was undesirable, native salt marsh vegetation was planted instead, resulting in enhancement of the injured habitat. Since the primary restoration actions yielded improve...

AB  - Waychinicup Estuary (south-western Australia) is dominated by tidal and swell exchange with the ocean and receives seasonal, but low, freshwater inflows. The estuary was surveyed in September 1995 to determine the significance of freshwater inflows to its ecology and to provide a detailed inventory of benthic flora and fauna because, like other estuaries, Waychinicup may come under pressure for diversion of inflows to meet demand for potable water. Gradients detected in benthic flora and fauna, sediment grain size and organic content, and water quality, were related to distance from the river mouth. Sediments closest to the river mouth had a higher organic content and a higher percentage of <63 μm particles. These areas had a low water clarity (SDD = 0.6m). Further from the river, the sediments became less organic and coarser, and water clarity increased (SDD >7 m). We hypothesise that biotic gradients in the estuary are determined by freshwater inflow, principally through its contribution of fine and organic sediments, and less so through its effect on salinity. These sediments are prone to resuspension, reducing water clarity, limiting plant growth and providing a niche for euryhaline, low light-adapted macroalgae and a polychaete-dominated infauna in the upper estuary. Change in sediment type, increase in water clarity and increasing salinity produces a shift to a diverse macroalgal and seagrass community, and an amphipod-dominated benthic fauna in the lower estuary. Despite the dominance of oceanic exchange in the estuary, freshwater inflow is a key determinant of the composition and distribution of biota. Any significant reduction in freshwater inflow is likely to cause a change in water quality and biota; the system would have lower organic inputs, become clearer, and the plant and animal assemblages currently found in the upper reaches of the estuary may well be lost.

AB  - Following industrial decline, much of the South Wales coastline is undergoing regeneration and water frontage is the development focus. The construction of the Millennium Park, Millennium Coastal Path and Earth Structure at Llanelli, South Wales, UK stimulated a commercial and domestic property redevelopment strategy. However, this took place without due consideration of coastal processes and location. Furthermore, because of previous dereliction and lack of valuable infrastructure, temporal coastal data had not been collected as pail of strategic monitoring. Consequently, following storm events the coastal path suffered catastrophic failure, the Earth Structure suffered erosion and significant damage became apparent on many newly constructed homes. Existing seawalls were undermined and required rock armour protection and their ability to protect recent developments is now in question. Causes and effects included inappropriate siting of infrastructure, advancing the line without due consideration of coastal processes and relocation of nearshore river channels. Lessons had not been learned following similar construction patterns elsewhere. Existing coastal defences and annual maintenance spending are both shown to be inadequate and inappropriate dredging practices are removing sediment from the system. This has serious repercussions for the coastal protection authority, not least as a result of threats to further development phases and legal repercussions. Strategies are suggested for long term management along the full coastal frontage, including financial implications of not strengthening coastal defences.

AB  - This investigation was undertaken to determine whether the mosquito larvicide temephos (applied as Abate 4-E ®) created an environmental hazard for nontarget organisms in a southwest Florida salt marsh community. Field toxicity tests were performed during routine larvicide applications using larvae of salt marsh crabs (Aratus pesonii and Uca rapax) and adult Mysidopsis bahia. Laboratory toxicity tests were performed using survival through 48 and 96 h and through first molt as toxicity endpoints. Larvae of both species exhibited 96 h lowest observable effects concentration (LOEC) in the range of 15 to 20 μg/L temephos. First-molt LOEC ranged from 7 to 12 μg/L. No effect on M. bahia survival, growth, or fecundity was observed up to 40 μg/L temephos. Field studies of routine temephos application rates produced an expected environmental concentration (EEC) of 12 ± 10 μg/L in marsh water, causing an environmental hazard to crab larvae. Reduction of the application rate effectively reduced the EEC to 4 ± 3 μg/L, indicating no hazard for 48 and 96 h toxicity; however, a hazard was observed for survival through the first molt. This information was used to modify larviciding applications to effect a reduction of the environmental hazard to nontarget organisms in the salt marsh.

AB  - In September 1983, an underground pipeline break resulted in a 31,000 barrel crude oil spill into Little Panoche Creek, Fresno County, California. The crude oil spill saturated soil and vegetation for two miles along the creek. Mitigation measures included the construction of small water ponding areas to enhance the growth of existing marsh vegetation, and seeding to revegetate the creek banks with indigenous shrubs to provide cover for wildlife and minimize soil erosion. Contaminated soil was stockpiled to allow it to biodegrade, rather than use the costly alternative of landfill disposal. The creek habitat was near full recovery one year after the spill.

AB  - <jats:p>This paper describes the performance of test panels of riprap on an offshore island in the Wash estuary, UK, for the first 2h years after their construction, by which time all but one had failed. It outlines the methods used in obtaining and analysing data on stone size, wind, tides and waves. The techniques used in surveying the test panels for damage and the reduction of the survey data to yield quantitative estimates of damage are described. Comparisons are made between the damage to the riprap panels and what might have been estimated using laboratory data. Results do not support any scale effect causing riprap sized on laboratory data to be larger than necessary, and this conclusion is supported by the outcome of model tests carried out retrospectively by the Hydraulics Research Station (now HRS Ltd) at Wallingford, UK. Slope protection is sensitive not only to wave height and stone size but also to construction methods and, bearing in mind possible departures from the desired specification, a cautious approach to the design of riprap protection is advisable.</jats:p>

AB  - Lake Renwick Heron Rookery Nature Preserve, located approximately 61 kilometers (38 miles) southwest of downtown Chicago, is home to a nesting colony of state threatened Black-crowned night herons, Great egrets, Double crested cormorants, Great blue herons, and Cattle egrets. A 2000 census recorded over 1,200 active nest sites at the 129.5-hectare (320-acre) preserve owned by the Forest Preserve District of Will County and Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Erosion of nesting island shorelines caused by fluctuating water levels due in part to local quarrying operations, wave action, and longshore transport has resulted in habitat loss and degradation. A majority of nesting trees on the East Island Group have died and/or toppled. This lead to preparation of a feasibility study addressing the creation of nesting opportunities, stabilization of eroding nesting island shorelines, and maintaining/improving access to and from the water for young flightless birds. Four types of artificial nesting structures, including 11.28 meter (37 foot) tall 4-pole 6-level structures, 6.71 meter (22 foot) tall single pole 4-level structures, 5.18 meter (17 foot) tall single pole 3-level structures, and ground level brush boxes were subsequently designed to accommodate the vertical nesting hierarchy exhibited by the colony. A biotechnical shore protection detail incorporating a rock toe and soil bioengineering techniques was developed to stabilize the nesting island shorelines and supplement ground level nesting opportunities. Habitat improvements such as planting 500 tree and shrub seedlings, and placement of course woody debris and snags were also incorporated into the final design. All nesting structures, and a majority of the shoreline protection and habitat improvements were completed between November 2000 and March 2001, after resident birds had vacated the rookery for winter but prior to their spring return. The remaining shoreline protection and habitat improvements will begin in September 2001 after the birds again vacate the rookery.

AB  - Sedges and grasses have a competitive advantage over cattails at higher elevations in Great Lakes wetlands where periodic low lake levels result in soils too dry to support cattails. Regulation of Lake Ontario water levels eliminated low lake-level years, resulting in cattail invasion. At a wetland scale at two Lake Ontario sites, we tested restoration methods by dredging channels through cattails, using spoil materials to create mounds suitable for sedge/grass growth, seeding mounds, and controlling cattails (T. × glauca) using methods adapted from experimental studies. Soil moisture and subsidence of mound soils were monitored. Vegetation was sampled pre-restoration and in shoreline sedge/grass meadow, emergent, and mound zones for two years following implementation. Although spoil mounds decreased in elevation at both sites, soil moisture increased more at the site with greater subsidence. Mean percent cover and ramet counts of cattails were reduced in sedge/grass and emergent zones at both sites. Mounds with greater soil moisture held more cattails post-construction. Across years at both sites, Carex lacustris and Calamagrostis canadensis increased in the sedge/grass meadow zone with reduction in Typha; Calamagrostis increased on the mounds. Key factors affecting results were cattail litter and, on the mounds, a second year of seeding with in situ cold, moist stratification, as well as soil moisture related to subsidence. Recommendations for future restorations include conducting more detailed soil surveys to assess potential subsidence, dredging wider and deeper channels to provide spoil for higher mounds, actively controlling invasive species, and conducting additional years of post-restoration data collection. © 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research

AB  - When Hurricane Irene hit North Carolina's coast in 2011, waves 2 meters high began pounding the shore. Two properties on Pine Knoll Shores, a community on one of the state's many barrier islands, provided a study in contrasts. One homeowner had installed a concrete bulkhead to protect his yard from the sea. But the churning waves overtopped and ultimately toppled the wall, washing away tons of sediment and leaving a denuded mud flat. Less than 200 meters away, another owner had installed a "living shoreline"—a planted carpet of marsh grass that gently sloped into the water, held in place by a rock sill placed a few meters offshore. The onrushing water bent the marsh grasses almost flat, but their flexing stalks dampened the waves and their deep roots held the soil. After the hurricane passed, the grasses sprang back; the property weathered the storm largely intact. The contrast highlights how defenses inspired by nature, rather than concrete armor, can protect coastlines from battering storms.

AB  - Baratti Bay used to serve as port to the Etruscan hilltop settlements of Populonia. Iron ore was melted on the beach from then until Roman times; clinkers were stored inland (approximately 2.5 million tons), completely covering the Etruscan necropolis that had been placed near the coast. After a few occasional findings during the 19 th century, the archaeological site was finally revealed when this material started to be quarried in 1921. A large amount of sediments was then produced and partially discharged onto the beach, leading to accretion and shoreline progradation. When this input ended, the beach facing the necropolis underwent slow but continuous erosion, leading to planform reassessment. The bay never acquired a stable configuration, since after World War II reforestation within the watershed reduced sediment input. Along the erosive bluff the site is exposed to waves; meltingfurnaces are then destroyed and archaeological findings become looted by occasional pillagers. The unique landscape of Baratti Bay, its clear and sheltered waters and the proximity of the archaeological site all make of Baratti one of the most popular bathing beaches in Tuscany. A multi-buoy mooring area was created on the southern side, additionally protected by a botched low-crest jetty, but this structure traps sand from the central beach, increasing erosion and reducing efficiency in mooring area functions. Shoreline stabilisation is necessary for the protection of this archaeological site and also to maintain and support local tourism. Whereas hard shore protection structures contrast with landscape protection, soft defence strategies may also be difficult to implement. Beach nourishment appears possibly as the best solution, but additional sediment fill without protection will increase siltation in the mooring area, and it is difficult to find sand of the same local petrographic composition (considered as cultural heritage, highly appealing due to sparkling hematite grains). The project execution has recently been suspended and the ruins of the archaeological area are converting the beach into a narrow rubble strip.

AB  - The research on the effect of coastal facilities for protecting an estuary from channel blockage and a coast from beach erosion by waves demands to understand wave propagation, nearshore current and sediment transportation. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of jetty and propose countermeasures to compensate insufficient safety in Chumphon estuary, Chumpon province. The field survey is executed, topographic maps, bathymetric data, wave data for storm surges, tidal data were collected and inputted in Ca’s numerical model (Ca et. al., 2000). This model consists of the near shore fluid dynamic model based on the Boussinesq equation and the topographical change model which the bed load and the suspended load were considered. Although the jetties are very effective for channel maintenance, since diffraction waves by the jetties has drawn sand in the north-side beach of the jetties toward the jetties, serious coastal erosion has occurred in the center of this north-side beach. Moreover, according to the simulation results by using Ca’s model, in the south-side beach of the jetties, if a typhoon of Linda classes hits this area, since heavy overtopping occurs, wave dissipation facilities are necessary

AB  - The research on the effect of coastal facilities for protecting an estuary from channel blockage and a coast from beach erosion by waves demands to understand wave propagation, a nearshore current and sediment transportation. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of jetties to the Chumphon estuary coast in Chumphon province, Thailand, and propose measures for erosion protecting in this coast. The long term prediction by a one-line model indicates the heavy erosion of around 1000m northward from the jetties, the erosion around 250m and 650 m southward from the jetties. As for the erosion of around 250 m southward, measures were examined in the last inter-national conference of ISOPE. As for the erosion of around 650 m southward, since there is no property which should be protected, it is ignored here. Therefore, about the heavy erosion of around 1000 m northward, measures are examined. In this study, since almost of all sand must be transported to jetties, sand nourishment is not a good measure. Detached breakwaters, artificial reefs, and non-measures are examined with the costs on the construction or the compensation, and the prevention effect of wave overtopping, short term erosion, and deterioration of a view. It makes clear that the most effective measure is non-measures (in other words, it is “set back”).

AB  - The project described in this paper includes development of surge ensemble modelling for the UK, and demonstration of probabilistic coastal flood forecasting for an area in the Irish Sea. Its purpose is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate probabilistic methods for surge, nearshore wave, and coastal flood forecasting in England and Wales, but the concepts and models would be equally applicable elsewhere. The main features that distinguish these methods from existing practice are in the use of hydraulic models extending through to action at coastal defences, and the use of ensemble and other probabilistic approaches throughout. Use of offshore forecasts to estimate the likelihood of high overtopping involves transformation of wave forecasts through the nearshore and surf zones, and the combined effects of wind, waves and sea level in causing overtopping. The model is outlined and site-specific measurements of waves and overtopping discharges are described and compared to the probabilistic predictions of the model. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Coastal dunes fringe the coast between Southport and Liverpool in northwest England, forming a natural barrier which prevents marine flooding of low-lying agricultural land in West Lancashire and north Merseyside. The dunes are best developed at Formby Point, where they reah 25 m above sea-level and blown sand extends some 4 km inland. This paper presents the results of an initial programme of field drilling, sediment analysis and radiocarbon dating which suggest that the dune complex developed from a large offshore sandbank, which was in existence by 6800 years ago. -from Authors

AB  - The coastal region of Bangladesh contributes to about one fifth of the country's landmass and one seventh of the total population. Once the region was diverse and rich in natural resources with huge forest vegetation, fishes, crops, poultry, livestock and wildlife, but at present, the whole region is at the verge of serious degradation due to human interventions and climate change. The study was carried out in Batiaghata upazila under Khulna district. Long term climatic data showed that there is an increasing trend of both maximum and minimum temperatures. On the other hand, although the annual rainfall has been increased in recent years but monthly distribution of rainfall is not even and it showed that the monsoon rainfall was increased by 56%, while dry season rainfall decreased by 60%. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns are accelerating flood, salinity and drought hazards, which are depleting both resources and environments. Increasing trend of cyclonic storms as well as tidal surges would be more and more vulnerable to climatic extremities in the coastal region. Due to intrusion of saline water for brackish water shrimp farming and increasing prolong drought, soil and water salinity have been increased remarkably, which adversely affecting both floral and faunal resources in the region. Increased soil and water salinity hampered soil fertility status and it was observed that around 27.36% soils organic matter has been depleted compared to base value of 1999. Suitable coping and adaptation measures should be taken immediately to restore the coastal ecosystem for sustaining agricultural production and development.

AB  - Brownlowia tersa is a low-ground semi-evergreen shrub species.  The phenological events occur sequentially—leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting from April to November.  It is hermaphroditic, protandrous, self-compatible, facultative xenogamous, and melittophilous involving worker honey bees, small male and female carpenter bees and male and female cuckoo bees.  Of these, worker honey bees and female carpenter bees forage for both pollen and nectar while male carpenter bees and both sexes of cuckoo bees forage exclusively for nectar.  Cuckoo bees are very important for cross-pollination because they are swift fliers and visit many flowers from different plants in the shortest time.  Carpenter bees and honey bees are largely important for self-pollination as they are not fast fliers and tend to spend more time at each flower for forage collection.  The flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism to resort to autonomous autogamy if not pollinated but this mode of pollination is subject to the availability of pollen in its own anthers.  Fruit is a 1-seeded follicle produced from a single carpel of the flower.  It is indehiscent and floats in tidal water when detached from the plant.  When settled in muddy substratum, it breaks open to expose the seed which germinates and produces a new plant in quick succession.  The study reports that the plant is highly threatened due to different human economic activities taking place in the area and hence immediate in situ conservation measures are required for its protection and propagation. </jats:p>

AB  - This study is based on the data obtained from tests carried out in the Large Wave Flume (Grosser Wellenkanal (GWK)) in Hannover in the frame of a joint research project of Ghent University (Belgium) and Forschungszentrum Kuste (FZK, Germany). The goal of the research project is to determine the wave induced loads on vertical storm walls located at the end of overtopped dike, which are designed to protect coastal cities from overtopping and floods. The loads resulting from waves overtopping the dike and impacting the vertical wall as a bore are measured by means of both force and pressure sensors. This paper describes the results of pressure and force records at the vertical wall, including a comparative analysis of the overall forces obtained by pressure integration and force sensors for two different wall setups: Fully blocked wall and partially blocked wall.

AB  - This work illustrates the methodology developed to evaluate the risk of coastal flooding and its application to Vale do Lobo beach, located in the Loule Municipality, a Portuguese coastal area under significant touristic pressure. The methodology is based on six main steps: 1) division of the study area into sub-areas with similar characteristics in terms of coastal defense; 2) determining the probability of exceeding the pre-set thresholds of flood levels for each study area; 3) establishment of qualitative factors related to the consequences of such excess of the flood levels; 4) the combination of the above steps for expeditious assessment of flood risks; 5) identification of the risk areas; 6) proposal for risk adaptation. The determination of the flood levels is based on the local wave regime at the Faro wave-buoy over 9 years, on its propagation to the study area using the SWAN model integrated in the geographic information system (GIS), GUIOMAR, together with the calculation of run-up and flooding levels based on empirical formulae. Special emphasis is placed on the automation of this process in GUIOMAR to make it an efficient tool for risk assessment. To determine the risk of coastal flooding, a methodology has been developed using the geographic information system and a multi-criteria analysis to assess the vulnerability of the territory in several episodes of flooding and to determine the different risk areas.

AB  - The aeolian landscape comprising sandy beach and dunes is a highly dynamic and fragile system in the coastal area. Land uplift at Estonian coasts has created a series of different landforms. Most of the coastal area of Estonia emerged from the regressive sea in different phases of the Limnea Sea. These coasts had a deficiency of sediment drift and therefore the coastal formations are low. In this paper our attention is focused mainly on changes of Estonian coastal ecosystems in protected areas. The research is based on compiling landscape profiles, land cover maps and geobotanical studies. The aeolian coastal landscapes are diverse and the majority of their ecosystems are quite close to the specific natural habitat. Coastal ecosystems are strongly affected by their geomorphology, based on the character of deposits and moisture conditions. The aeolian coastal ecosystems of Estonia are well represented in the list of the European Union Habitats (Natura 2000). The coastal ecosystems are rapidly changed by waves, winds and human impact. The greatest decrease in the sandy beach vegetation is due to the heavy storms accompanied by high sea level conditions. Farther from the shore the landscape is older and natural processes have stabilised. Most of the area is covered by forests, the open (treeless) communities occur occasionally in a narrow seaside belt. Afforestation is one of the most serious threats to open landscapes in the coastal area since it decreases the diversity of coastal ecosystems. In earlier times wooded areas were also used for grazing. In recent decades, building and recreation intensity has increased considerably, resulting in a growing pressure on aeolian ecosystems. Nowadays a great part of coastal forests are protected. During the last decades recreation pressure has particularly increased in protected areas. The present work proved the need to observe the changes in vegetation communities and to implement management measures to maintain the unique dune landscape.

AB  - A large earthquake shook the offshore region of Portugal in Nov 1, 1755 with an estimated magnitude of 8.5 plus or minus 0.3 in the Richter scale. It lead to the massive destruction of the city of Lisbon, which was followed by intense fires. In order to understand the consequences of such a wave on the sandy shores of the region, the authors explore the inlet shoreline and seaward exposed region of the estuary, the Troia peninsula. To do so, they integrate multiple types of data and information: dune ridge position were extracted from aerial photographs, shorelines from the historical maps, shoreline progradation rates, Ground Penetrating Radar profiles and optically stimulated dating of barrier sediments. This information allows them to reconstruct the shoreline following the tsunami, documenting a greater impact towards the inlet where the water flow concentrate as it entered the estuary. The impact of the tsunami in Troia peninsula translates on the erosion of about 1,000 years of barrier deposits within the spit end.

AB  - Contaminants are present as mixtures in sediments within nearshore environments but are particularly associated with dredged material from historically industrialised areas. Ports, marinas and docks are continuously dredged for navigational purposes and material is usually disposed to sea. Recently, low contaminated dredged material is being considered for beneficial use to restore saltmarsh, recharge rivers and enhance estuarine areas impacted by natural or human activities. Where contaminants occur as mixtures, low levels of contaminants may act in an additive, synergistic or antagonist manner. Investigations of a range of mixture of metals using acute whole sediment bioassays have shown that metal mixtures appear to be less than additive. Nine metal mixtures were tested based on (1) a predicted model, (2) sediment quality guidelines (ERL/ERM) and (3) Action Levels for assessing dredged material. Acute sediment bioassays using the polychaete, Arenicola marina, were conducted and results show that only one mixture was acutely toxic whilst casting rates of the other mixtures were reduced over a 10 day period, but these were not significantly different (p=<0.05) from the controls. Results show Arenicola marina to be more tolerant of high concentrations of metal mixtures than previously expected. Current risk assessment procedures and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) appear to be sufficiently precautionary at the lower 'uncontaminated' range which may lead to the increased beneficial use of dredged sediments; material that was once considered to be a waste product.

AB  - The estuarine environment often hosts a salt wedge-a layer of denser seawater advected by the rising tide under fresh water discharged by the river. The nature of the stratification is a function of the tide's range and speed of advance, river discharge volumetric flow rate and river mouth morphology. The competing effects of temperature and salinity on sound speed present the question: Is the salt wedge acoustically observable? Using temperature and salinity profiles collected in situ, numerical results show that the salt wedge can impact acoustic propagation. Acoustically, this environment can be approximated by two isospeed layers separated by a thin gradient. While this three-layer very shallow water acoustic waveguide is typically dominated by high angle multipath propagation, refraction occurring in the gradient layer allows low-angle energy from near-surface sources to be trapped above the gradient and creates a shadow zone below the gradient. Energy from near-bottom sources is refracted to higher angles and attenuated more quickly. Acoustic fluctuations observed at an upstream/downstream receiver depend upon the presence/absence of bedforms and the interaction between the advancing/receding tide and the river discharge, which can include the presence of internal waves propagating along the top of the salt wedge.

AB  - Soil phototrophic microbes play key roles in many ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling, water absorption and retention, substrate weathering and soil stabilization, as well as colonization and persistence of other organisms. Knowledge about the diversity and biomass of soil phototrophs remains limited, especially in tropical forests and savannas. Here, we investigate changes in the diversity and abundance of soil phototrophs across the 4-km elevation gradient on Mt. Cameroon, Africa, from tropical forests (0–2300 m) to treeless savanna (2300–3600 m) and afroalpine vegetation (3600–4000 m). We evaluated the role of soil chemistry and vegetation cover in shaping phototrophic diversity patterns using soil, tree and herb census data from 224 permanent plots. Cyanobacteria from Chroococcales accounted for 65% of the species richness and > 70% of the biovolume. The highest phototrophic diversity and biovolume were recorded in treeless savanna and afroalpine vegetation, and lowest values in mid-elevation tropical forests with dense understory vegetation and hence limited light availability. Higher diversity and biovolume of soil phototrophs were associated with less productive, well-illuminated soils with lower organic matter and nitrogen content and higher pH, phosphorus and cation content. Changes in microbial richness and biovolume across tropical forests showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with higher values recorded in coastal and lowland forests up to 1000 m elevation, the lowest values in the mid-elevation open-canopy forests with dense understory vegetation caused by disturbances of forest elephants and higher values again in montane forests between 1800 and 2200 m. Above the tree line, soil phototrophic biovolume also showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with lower richness recorded in compact grasslands between 2700 and 3400 m. At lower-elevation savanna, soil phototrophs are indirectly supported by regular fires during the dry season, which reduces plant cover and increases soil phosphorus and cations, while barren lava fields at higher elevations around the summit support soil phototrophs directly via increased soil P and K content and indirectly by inhibiting plant growth and vegetation cover. Our results shed light on an overlooked part of soil biodiversity in major tropical ecosystems and uncover the role of various ecological filters in structuring phototrophic microbial communities in tropical soils.

AB  - Despite the numerous publications on the matter, the extent to which some/all marine populations rely on self-recruitment and whether this reliance is stable in time and space currently remains unanswered. This is particularly true for populations from isolated oceanic archipelagos, such as the New Zealand (NZ) subantarctic islands and the Kermadec Islands. The specific objectives of this thesis were to: 1) assess the genetic diversity, phylogeography and contemporary levels of dispersal and self-recruitment in populations of the Cellana strigilis limpet complex, endemic to the NZ subantarctic islands; 2) conduct a morphometric analysis of the C. strigilis complex to complement its molecular investigation; 3) develop and optimize specific microsatellite markers for Nerita melanotragus, a marine gastropod of the Kermadec Islands and New Zealand North Island rocky shores; 4) assess the genetic structuring and levels of connectivity of N. melanotragus populations within the Kermadec Islands, within NZ North Island, and between the Kermadec Islands and NZ; and 5) compare the genetic structuring of N. melanotragus at the Kermadec Islands to that of NZ North Island populations, to test for any island effect on connectivity levels, and test for possible gene flow between the two groups. Genetic investigation of the C. strigilis complex confirmed the presence of two distinct lineages, separated by their sister species Cellana denticulata. Morphometric analyses were congruent with molecular analyses, and were used to provide a new taxonomic description of the C. strigilis limpet complex: two species were recognized, Cellana strigilis and Cellana oliveri. The role of the subantarctic islands during the last glacial maximum was highlighted, and the colonisation history of the islands by the two Cellana species was explained. Contemporary levels of connectivity (gene flow) among the different populations of the two lineages were low, or non-existant, revealing their high reliability on self-recruitment. However, the analysis detected a recent migration event in one of the two lineages. Considering the geographical distance of the islands and the life history of the Cellana species, the use of mediated dispersal means (e.g., rafting on a natural substrate such as kelp) seems very likely. Ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for N. melanotragus, and seven of those were used to investigate the levels of connectivity and self-recruitment in six populations from the Kermadec Islands, and nine populations from the east coast of NZ North Island. According to what can be expected for a species with a long pelagic larval duration (PLD), genetic homogeneity was recorded for the Kermadec Islands populations. A lack of genetic structuring was also found for the nine populations on the NZ North Island, which is congruent with the literature in this geographic area. However, what was surprising was the high level of genetic homogeneity found between the Kermadec Islands and the NZ North Island, meaning that the two groups are effectively exchanging individuals. Hence, the Kermadec archipelago can be considered open at the scale of the South Pacific, for N. melanotragus populations. This Ph.D. highlights the importance of having the correct taxonomy for conservation and connectivity studies, and gives a better understanding of the historical and contemporary patterns of genetic connectivity in the NZ offshore islands. It illustrated how historical events, such as the last glacial maximum, can shape local genetic diversity, and how this historical pattern can be maintained because of limited contemporary gene exchange. Also, this thesis demonstrated that remote populations could be strongly connected to mainland populations, contributing to the resilience of both systems and confirming the necessity of integrating remote oceanic habitats in the creation of effective Marine Protected Areas (MPA) networks to protect the marine environment.

AB  - A simulation model examined the influence of barrier islands on the estuarine ecosystems of Louisiana, Coastal barrier islands can act as a first line of protection for inland wetlands and human communities against storm waves and wind. These geomorphologic features provide wave reduction, flooding attenuation, and preservation of salinity gradients. Therefore, the model assessed the importance of the islands' relative location within the estuary. A hydrodynamic model computed wave height and circulation patterns for a test case. The results of this numerical experiment were then used to compute habitat composition and faunal response under holistic methodologies (e,g. regional Habitat Suitability Index [HSI] for a particular species). This analysis and simulation is presented its it first step in the development of a comprehensive model of estuary management with emphasis on barrier island restoration and preservation.

AB  - Eel grass (Zostera marina) beds in San Diego Bay are a protected habitat and artificial planting of beds is often accepted as mitigation for environmental disruption. The beds reduce sediment erosion, serve as a nursery for young fish and benthic organisms, and hence attract larger foragers. Which environmental parameters control the growth and distribution of eel grass, and under what conditions, is still uncertain. Though submarine light levels are felt to be the dominant control, individuals of a given species may have different light requirements when growing in different habitats of the same estuary and may require more light as variability in the available light increases. Extensive, independent surveys of water quality parameters (such as transmissivity, chlorophyll, total suspended solids and temperature) collected by NRaD, and surveys of bottom depth and eel grass coverage conducted by Southwest Division were combined to examine light attenuation as a determinant in eel grass success.

AB  - This paper deals with process-based simulations of distributed flood-control measures such as changes of land-use or soil-tillage practices, small retention ponds, and the rehabilitation of rivers aiming to quantify the flood-reducing effects. In this context several challenges have to be met, because these measures have different impacts on the whole rainfall-runoff process including runoff generation, runoff concentration, and flood routing. This study chooses a combined modelling approach that comprises the physically based rainfall-runoff model WaSiM-ETH (Version 8.4.2, SCHULLA 1997) and the 2D hydrodynamic numerical model HYDRO_AS-2D (NUJIC 1998) that is parameterized also by means of measurements in the field. On the one hand, these field data prove the influences of the different types of land uses (grassland, forest, ploughland) on soil hydraulic properties and provide the basis for the land-use-dependent parameterization of the soil model in WaSiM-ETH. The measurements show that the soil matrix under grassland has the best infiltration and water storage properties among the types of land use considered. On the other hand, in combination with laboratory studies, the collected data are used to identify the best fitting pedotransfer function for the study area, which is important to minimize uncertainties regarding the use of different types of pedotransfer functions in a physically based rainfall-runoff-model. After being constructed, parameterized, and calibrated, the models are coupled with an offline-connection by adding the runoff of each sub-basin in WaSiM-ETH to HYDRO_AS-2D as boundary conditions. The high fitting quality of calibration results demonstrates that the chosen coupled modelling approach can be applied in further research. The distributed flood control measures are parameterized by using field and laboratory data, literature sources, and historical marshland and drainage maps. Subsequently their flood-reducing effectiveness is quantified in the rural, mesoscale study area of the Windach catchment (A sub(EZG) 65 km super(2)) for different flood events. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of flood-reducing measures is influenced on a case-by-case basis by different parameters, e.g. the course of the hydrograph, the peak flow or the runoff volume. The highest effect is achieved by an integrated concept including retention ponds, rehabilitation of rivers and marshlands as well as afforestation. In this case, peak flow can be reduced by 11% (HQ sub(100) advective event) to 26% (HQ sub(60) convective event). The small retention ponds (max. 50,000 m super(3)) turned out to be the most effective single measures of distributed flood control as they can reduce the flood peak even of an advective HQ sub(100) by roughly 10%. Generally, decentralized flood control has the highest potential in the case of convective heavy rainfall events.Original Abstract: Der Artikel beschaeftigt sich mit der prozessorientierten Modellierung dezentraler HochwasserschutzmaBnahmen, die sich in Form von Landnutzungs- bzw. Bewirtschaftungsanderungen, als dezentrale Kleinrueckhaltebecken oder renaturierte Gewaesserverlaeufe darstellen, um ihre Wirksamkeit unter verschiedenen Randbedingungen zu quantifizieren. Der Anspruch der Prozessnaehe bedeutet insofern eine groBe Herausforderung, da dezentrale HochwasserschutzmaBnahmen auf sehr unterschiedliche Weise in den Niederschlag-Abfluss-Prozess eingreifen und Abflussbildung, Abflusskonzentration und Wellenablauf im Gerinne beeinflussen koennen. Es wird ein kombinierter Modellansatz aus dem physikalisch basierten Wasserhaushaltsmodell WaSiM-ETH 8.4.2 (SCHULLA 1997) und dem 2D-hydrodyna-misch-numerischen Modell HYDRO_AS-2D (NUJIC 1998) gewaehlt, welcher auch unter Nutzung von Feldmessungen parametrisiert wird. Die Datenerhebungen im Felde dienen dabei zum einen dem Nachweis des Einflusses der unterschiedlichen Landnutzungsformen Gruenland, Wald und Acker auf bodenhydraulische Eigenschaften als Grundlage fuer die landnutzungsabhaengige Parametrisierung des Bodenmodell in WaSiM-ETH. Dabei weist die Bodenmatrix beim Gruenlandstandort die guenstigsten Infiltrations- und Speichereigen-schaften auf. Zum anderen werden die Messergebnisse im Zusammenhang mit Laboruntersuchungen dafuer verwendet, eine fuer das Untersuchungsgebiet geeignete Pedotransferfunktion (PTF) zu identifizieren, da hieraus groBe Unsicherheiten bei der physikalisch basierten Modellierung resultieren. Nach Modellerstellung, -parametrisierung und -kalibrierung erfolgt die offline-Kopplung beider Modelle durch eine quasi-diffuse Zugabe der WaSiM-ETH-Teilgebietsabfliisse als Randbedingungen in HYDRO_AS-2D. Die Kalibrier- und Simulationsergebnisse nach Kopplung werden als sehr gut bewertet und bestatigen die Anwendbarkeit des gewaehlten Modellansatzes fuer die weitere Untersuchung. Unter Nutzung der Messdaten aus Feld und Labor, von Literaturwerten und historischen Moorkarten bzw. Draenplaenen werden die im laendlich gepraegten mesoskaligen Untersuchungsgebiet (noerdliches Teileinzugsgebiet der Windach, A sub(EZG) 65 km super(2)) umsetzbaren dezentralen HochwasserschutzmaBnahmen im Modell parametrisiert und ihre Wirksamkeit fuer verschiedene Hochwasserereignisse quantifiziert. Die Modellierungsergebnisse zeigen, dass je nach MaBnahme unterschiedliche Parameter wie der Verlauf der Abflussganglinie, die Abflussspitze oder das Abflussvolumen ihre Wirksamkeit beeinflussen. Dabei sind neben einem kombinierten MaBnahmenkonzept (Abminderung: 18% bzw. 11% bei durch advektive Niederschlaege verursachte HQ sub(10) bzw. HQ sub(100) und 19% bzw. 26% bei durch konvektive Niederschlaege verursachte HQ sub(50) bzw. HQ sub(60)) die dezentralen Kleinrueckhaltebecken als wirksamste dezentrale HochwasserschutzmaBnahme anzusehen, da sie den Hochwasserscheitel auch bei einem advektiven HQ sub(100) um ca. 10% abmindern koennen. Grundsaetzlich zeigt sich das groeBte Potential des dezentralen Hochwasserschutzes bei konvektiven Starkniederschlaegen.

AB  - Coral reefs are iconic, threatened ecosystems that have been in existence for approximately 500 million years, yet their continued ecological persistence seems doubtful at present. Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamics that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent diseases due to increased heat and irradiation, as well as decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO(2), are the most important large-scale threats. On more local scales, overfishing and destructive fisheries, coastal construction, nutrient enrichment, increased runoff and sedimentation, and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species have caused phase shifts away from corals. Already approximately 20% of the world's reefs are lost and approximately 26% are under imminent threat. Conservation science of coral reefs is well advanced, but its practical application has often been lagging. Societal priorites, economic pressures, and legal/administrative systems of many countries are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystems. Nevertheless, many examples of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action. When effectively managed, protected areas have contributed to regeneration of coral reefs and stocks of associated marine resources. Local communities often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism and/or improved resource levels. Coral reefs create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over $4 billion. Thus, no conflict between development, societal welfare, and coral-reef conservation needs to exist. Despite growing threats, it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystems. Conservation science plays a critical role in designing effective strategies.

AB  - 1. The spatial distribution of the most important subtidal habitats (coral reefs, coral carpets, seagrass meadows, sand with corals, macroids, mud, hardgrounds) and mangroves was mapped in northern Safaga Bay, Red Sea, Egypt. Coral communities were analysed separately for their ecological and spatial patterns. This, coupled with information about major current patterns in the bay, provides a framework on which to base impact predictions for planned developments or for those already underway. 2. Because the entire shoreline of northern Safaga Bay is earmarked for tourism development, the following impacts have already been observed and can be expected to worsen: dredging, coastal infilling, marina construction, alteration of inshore current patterns as a result of breakwater construction and eutrophication. 3. The maps of habitats could be used by management authorities to either license or forbid these activities in specific areas, thus avoiding damage to sensitive environments. Properly used, resource mapping is a powerful proactive management tool that allows resource managers to anticipate and avoid impacts at an early stage in the process.

AB  - Shoreline stability is an important issue along much of the Mediterranean's Coasts. European project MEDDOOC INTERREG BEACHMED-e focused on the strategic management of beach protection for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean coastal zone. In the framework of this project, a video system has been installed in Valras (Gulf of Lions / France) to monitor coastal evolutions and recent protection works. Over the past 20 years, coastal video remote sensing techniques represent an efficient alternative tool to classical in situ surveying techniques. Coastal video monitoring is based on Time exposure images (Timex) acquisition and photogrammetry technique which allows transforming 2D image coordinates into the corresponding 2D real world coordinates. This paper presents the use of video monitoring technique to estimate the impact of engineering works. Important beach retreat has been observed for decades along the 3 km of Valras beaches and 12 breakwaters have been built until 2007. From January to May 2008, a new similar protection, a submerged breakwater and 95, 000 m3 sand nourishment have been added. As Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has become an established method for investigating temporal beach fluctuation, EOF is performed using weekly video monitored shorelines over a 6 months period. The results show: (1) the natural erosion / accretion phases of the already protected shoreline, (2) the impact of beach nourishment and the trend toward the equilibrium position of the restored shoreline, (3) the efficiency of video monitoring for shoreline management.

AB  - Our respect and understanding of the local environment is increasing with the recognition of its importance in our daily life. This is reflected in the Eco-Engineering Approach developed and used in dredging- and marine infrastructure projects. The approach starts with a thorough understanding of the local environment, and aims to increase overall value of the project both for nature, society and of course the project itself (economics and profitability). By focusing on synergies and development opportunities that strengthen both the environment and the project, construction and operational costs are reduced as well as lead times during permit process. We believe that this approach offers similar benefits to selected Offshore projects. It is based on the lessons learned and knowledge development gathered in the past years through the Building with Nature innovation programme, and experience gained from projects in daily practice. This allows for a head start on offshore projects. Eco-engineering starts from dedicated pre-project environmental monitoring to gain insight in the underlying physical and ecological processes. This provides the basis for project design and, later on, the construction and operation works. For nature, it is about recognizing key environmental values and the presence and resilience of sensitive receivers at an early stage. This enables optimization of project design and implementation of adaptive work methods with the objective to enhance habitat (soft and hard substrate), and to ensure minimal impact. For the physical environment, designs and work methods can be adapted to allow for beneficial use of natural forces such as sediment transport, currents and waves. Examples for offshore projects include landfalls in sensitive near shore/intertidal and wetland areas, landscaping of seabeds, scour protection and rock coverings to decrease volumes and increase ecological habitats and use of ecologically designed Gravity Based Structures acting as reefs. Joint development and implementation of the approach, and creation of support within the project stakeholder community are some of the major lessons learned and success factors of the Building with Nature innovation programme. By bringing together a broad range of stakeholders at start of the programme consisting of research institutes, universities, NGO s and local stakeholders, industry, consultants and governments, ensures mutual understanding and respect for each other s goals and approaches. Instead of being restrictive towards each other with continuous scrutiny during every step in the process, the network interacts and develops innovative knowledge, thereby strengthening each other s ideas. Contractors played a key role in this development by initiating the Building with Nature programme, subsequently taking responsibility in contracts and developing and implementing the Eco-Engineering approach in daily practice. This approach contributes importantly to a sustainable future for both the sector/industry as well as the environment in which they operate. Copyright 2015, Offshore Technology Conference.

AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) is increasing the risk of flooding in marginal low-lying estuarine areas. High water levels in estuaries are associated with the simultaneous occurrence of various phenomena ranging from high tidal levels to large fresh-water discharges. The intense and diverse human occupation of some of these marginal areas increases the flood vulnerability, endangering human lives and causing heavy economic and environmental losses. This issue becomes even more relevant since the European Floods Directive establishes mandatory guidelines to all member states regarding flood risk assessment, integrating flood maps with territorial characteristics. The present study aims to assess the vulnerability to floods of a specific area in Tagus estuary, by integrating hydrodynamic modelling results with land use cartography. Results suggest that about 16.1% of the estuarine marginal fringe could be flooded for the 2050 scenario, rising up to 23.7% for the 2100 scenario. Moreover, industrial and urban areas will be the most affected sites. Considering future development scenarios planned for that site, the results point to an increasing vulnerability of urban areas and therefore to the relevance of this knowledge in future planning and management guidelines as well as measures to adapt to SLR. The uncertainties and implications of the study are also discussed, and future research topics are indicated. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Since the 19th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has played an important role in the development of California's coastal waterways primarily for commercial and military uses. Over the years, the Corps of Engineers coastal charter, under the Civil Works program, evolved into providing beach erosion control for the purpose of reducing storm related wave attack and inundation damages to local coastal communities. More recently, this charter has further evolved into protecting the nation's valuable coastal resources through implementation of ecosystem restoration and enhancement projects and through regionally managing coastal sediments. Today, armed with an array of Congressionally mandated authorities and the availability of funds at the local, State and Federal levels, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is positioned well to continue an active role in providing leadership and technical support in implementing partnered coastal resources related projects along the California shoreline that are mutually beneficial to national, regional and local interests. Presently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers involvement in coastal related Civil Works matters within the State of California can be partitioned into nine major initiatives: (1) data collection and scientific analyses to understand regional coastal processes and to establish regional sediment management plans; (2) navigation improvements to channels and features of major port and harbor facilities; (3) maintenance of existing Federal coastal navigation channels and structures; (4) development of dredged material management plans for the beneficial reuse of regional contaminated and non-contaminated dredged sediments; (5) coastal watershed management in the context of reducing adverse sediment and pollutant loading within coastal estuarine systems, including coastal lagoons and wetlands; (6) shoreline protection to prevent or reduce residential, commercial and public infrastructure damages associated with coastal storms; (7) the promotion and implementation of national programs at the local level that involve innovatively managing regional beach quality sediments and applying technologically advanced measures to abate shoreline erosion; and, (8) in cooperation and partnership with the State of California Resources Agency, optimally execute Federal and State participation in the management of California's coastal sediments through the development of an adaptive and comprehensive Coastal Sediments Management Master Plan that will ensure the future environmental, recreational and economic health and vitality of California's beaches and shorelines.

AB  - Research on the history and archaeology of the Caribbean has demonstrated the overwhelming importance of commerce and long distance trading and social networks for the peopling and the social development of the lands circling the Caribbean Sea. Navigation-riparian or maritime-is paramount in this consideration because water is ubiquitous in the 'water world' of the Caribbean Lowlands. The area includes the basins and deltas of two of the world's largest rivers, the Amazon and the Orinoco systems, and widely complex coastal plains stretching from northern Brazil and Surinam to Mexico, south Florida and the Caribbean Archipelago. The coastal dry land masses (continent or islands) are joined by water: rivers, swamps, marshes or the sea: a continent divided by water'. When the chronology of the social dynamics surrounding the Caribbean Sea are scrutinized, the pattern that emerges is of land-based economies and dispersed hunter-gatherer sites starting around 14kBP, but there is no evidence of settlement along the coasts or exploitation of marine resources until around 8kBP on the continents, or 7-5kBP on the islands. These dates coincide with a general sea level stabilization at 3-5 m below msl around 7kya. As sea level rose, shallow coastal areas flooded, transforming the hydrology, oceanography and morphology of the coastlines. Given the rate of eustatic sea-level rise during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, much of the early coastal landscapes around the American continents and the Caribbean Islands should be currently submerged, along with the evidence of human use of ancient coasts. The dry sites we today assume as early reflect settlement patterns that correspond to a relatively late configuration of the coastal morphology. However, underwater archaeology in the Caribbean has mostly focused on wrecks, if on anything at all, with practically no attention being paid to drowned landscapes. No marine geophysics analysis has been applied to underwater archaeology in the Caribbean so far. Given that early evidence of human activity should be submerged and possibly buried, the application of acoustic remote sensing techniques is the most time and cost effective survey method. Among these, high-resolution multi-channel and 3D seismic reflection surveying, in particular 3D Chirp systems, have proven to be very useful for the investigation of drowned landscapes as they can provide detailed stratigraphic information and visualization of buried archaeological objects. Even though no local studies have been conducted yet, this presentation focuses on the northeastern corner of the Caribbean Archipelago, at the contact between the Greater and the Lesser Antilles (Mona Passage, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and the Anegada Passage), identifying areas with the highest potential for preservation of submerged landscapes and associated sites, from a geoarchaeological perspective. While side-scan sonars are useful to observe the sea floor and to identify shipwrecks or fishing technology, I emphasize on the potential of seismic surveys with sub-bottom profilers for the identification of buried ancient landscapes and associated sites, particularly in shallow, low-energy environments. This type of study and preliminary evaluation will serve as a basis to establish a solid collaborative research program that will permit a more complete understanding of the socio-natural dynamics of the peopling of the Caribbean region. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Issue Title: The Interactions between Sediments and Water Phoslock(TM) is a specially modified clay designed to permanently bind phosphorus in those situations where phosphorus (P) release from sediments is a main driver of algal bloom formation. Extensive laboratory and mesocosm trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of Phoslock(TM) in binding sediment released P using less than a millimetre thickness of clay. Two full-scale applications were undertaken in the summer of 2001/2002 in the impounded riverine section of two estuaries along the coastal plain of south west Western Australia. Both rivers are subject to blue-green algal blooms in the summer months. Phoslock(TM) applied in a slurry from a small boat reduced dissolved P in the water column to below detection limit in the few hours it took for the clay to settle and substantially reduced P efflux from the sediments during the course of the trial. The effect of P reduction on phytoplankton growth was clearly evident in the phytoplankton dominated Vasse River but was less clear in the alternating phytoplankton to aquatic plant dominated Canning River which is also subject to surface nutrient inputs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Aquaculture is perceived by governments and international agencies as an economic alternative for poor communities in developing countries. Nevertheless, aquaculture must address environmental issues as well as economic and social aspects to achieve a sustainable development. Aquaculture with native species under semi-intensive conditions is a sustainable production alternative that minimizes the impact on aquatic ecosystems. An aquaculture pilot project with pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) was tested in a protected lagoon in Uruguay (Laguna de Rocha). Shrimp were reared in pen enclosures within their native habitat, where natural currents drive water renewal, and the natural food supply was supplemented with commercial food. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of F paulensis aquaculture on the water and sediment quality and the benthic community, and to estimate the maximum number of pen enclosures that Laguna de Rocha can sustain while maintaining the minimal environmental impact. A Before, After, Control Impact (BACT) sampling design was followed and the results of abiotic and biological variables were compared between treatment site (control, pens, and two areas at 15 and 50 m from the pens) and timing (before shrimp addition, during culture and after harvest), through ANOVA. The most significant impact was found inside the pens, where ammonium levels increased and benthos species richness and abundance decreased. A nitrogen-based-model was used to estimate the maximum number of pens in relation to the minimal impact on the ecosystem. Simulation indicated that up to 13 pens could be installed in the southern area of Laguna de Rocha without increasing the usual concentration of total nitrogen in other areas of the lagoon. The BACI design, the statistical analysis and the modeling tools proved to be effective, simple and low cost instruments to assess the environmental impact in a protected area. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the aims of the UK Government's Making Space for Water programme is to provide greater clarity for both the public at risk of flooding or erosion and professional bodies involved in flood and coastal erosion risk management. At present, flood risk from rivers and the sea is mapped to inform the public and authorities. However, limited information is available on the risk from coastal erosion. In 2006, Halcrow were commissioned by the Environment Agency to undertake the National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping project. This project aims to map coastal erosion risk, whilst taking account of the influence of current coastal protection and management activities. The project is due to be completed in 2009.

AB  - On the Para River (estuary) there are approximately one hundred tidal channels. These channels are important systems in both ecological and socio-economic systems. This paper aims to determine the tidal propagation pattern in the tidal channels in the dry and rainy seasons. Three tidal channels were selected on the left margin (Marajo Island). In a first experiment, two pressure sensors were installed in each channel for 13 hours during a spring tide, one in the mouth and the other approximately 3 km upstream. In a second experiment, 3 pressure sensors were installed in one of the channels (36 days): one outside the channel (Para river), one in the mouth and another one upstream in the channel. The first experiment revealed that the channels have similar pattern and asymmetric tidal regime, whose flood takes approximately 4 h and the ebb, 8 hours. The absence of an effective river discharge may favour the flood. The presence of sandy banks in the mouth of these channels trap the water inside, which makes the ebb last longer. In the second experiment, harmonic tidal constituents were obtained at the outside point. In the channel and channel mouth there was no variation in the low tidal level during the dry season, possibly due to morphology effects. In the rainy season there was slight variation in low tide level and this was more evident on the spring tide.

AB  - Seagrasses are flowering plants that inhabit coastal and transitional waters. They colonize sedimentary seabeds (and to a lesser extent rocky substrates) and present unique adaptations to the marine environment. Seagrasses are especially sensitive to environmental deterioration and live in a world that is particularly threatened by human activity. The response of the plants and their associated communities to disturbances is relatively well known. This has facilitated the development of a large number of seagrass bioindicators based on biochemical, physiological, morphological, structural, demographic, and community measures, especially after the deployment of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to a lesser extent the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Bioindicators are at the interface between science and policy. In order for their use by managers for different purposes (monitoring, water quality assessment, longterm changes, etc.) to be robust and consistent, a clear definition of management goals is needed. The development of bioindicators must also be based on careful © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In August 2011 the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) was realized at the entrance of the tidal dock 'Deurganckdok' in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Equipped with container terminals, Deurganckdok can receive vessels with a draught of 13,10m independent of the tide. Due to its position in a stretch of the Schelde estuary with salinity gradients near the estuarine turbidity maximum, Deurganckdok is subject to siltation. Accumulation of fine-grained cohesive sediments in the dock runs up to 1 million m3 annually and requires regular maintenance dredging. During the early stages of preliminary investigations for Deurganckdok (1997-1999), the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) was selected as a measure to reduce sedimentation. The design was adapted to function in an environment with salinity gradients during the feasibility research (2001-2004), which included physical and numerical modelling, supported by field measurements. Initial calculations predicted a reduction of 10-20% in sediment accumulation. In the final phase of investigations (2005-2007), state-of-the-art numerical models were calibrated with field measurements to enhance sediment accumulation predictions under a range of boundary conditions. In this paper the results are summarized of the preliminary investigations that have led to the design of the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW). © 2013 WODA.

AB  - This study defines the susceptibility of differing shoreline types in the Virginia Chesapeake Bay to erosion. There is a high variability of the coastal environments in this area influenced by: (1) the relict Pleistocene high-order dendritic drainage system, resulting in a large diversity of shore orientations; (2) the moderate, but highly variable wave energy in the Bay system and highly variable submergence rates, resulting in a spectrum of shoreline transformation from primary to secondary types; (3) exposures of coastal plain sediments of widely varying composition and volume; and (4) diverse salt marsh development. Eighty percent of the shore is composed of three morphologically distinct beach environments, each reflecting different susceptibilities to erosion: (1) Permeable beaches, composed entirely of sand-sized material, comprise 59% of the beaches (mean erosion = 0.85 m/yr) and have the largest vertical and horizontal dimensions. This provides the largest vertical buffer to the effects of storm surge and waves. (2) Impermeable beaches, composed of a veneer of sand overlying impermeable, pre-Holocene sediments, comprise 24% of the beaches. The combined influence of low swash infiltration, low beach elevation and groundwater effects result in the highest mean erosion (1.14 m/yr). (3) Marsh barrier beaches (17%), composed of a veneer of sand overlying peat, contains a resistant rhizome framework, resulting in the least erodable beach environment (0.66 m/yr). Marsh margins, the remaining 20% of the shoreline, are the least erodable shore environment (0.54 m/yr). There is a large variability in the local subsidence rates along the shoreline. The subsidence highs correspond to the areas with largest nearshore terraces and the main concentrations of salt marsh development. A balance in the shore stability exists as a result of salt marsh development: The marsh retards shore erosion, yet it occurs at the areas of highest local submergence where the highest shoreline retreat is expected. © 1980.

AB  - Rouse, H.L, Blackett, P., Hume, T.M., Bell, R.G, Britton, R. and Dahm, J., 2013. Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change: a New Zealand story. The requirement for using a participatory approach to consider options for adapting to climate change is well documented, but there are some key challenges of engaging with communities, especially over the complexities of projected climate change impacts and possible adaptation options. Here we describe the development of a two-stage method aimed to overcome these challenges, and the testing of this method in a coastal community in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island of New Zealand. First, at an Open Day we used projections of sea-level rise driven changes to coastal inundation, erosion and habitat change and mapped them on large aerial-photo maps to use as the basis for a participatory mapping exercise. The purpose of the Open Day was to elicit input on valued aspects of the Whitianga community that might be at threat from climate change. Second, at a follow-up Workshop we worked with the community to explore the potential for adaptation options to provide solutions' to these issues, exploring who the winners and losers would be for each option, and what would be required to enable the options to be actioned. The maps were a key tool in this engagement case-study, and we reflect on them in our discussion of their development and usefulness. Finally we summarise the lessons learned in this case study and describe four key inputs to successful community engagement: the right team, the right data, the right support, and the right resources.

AB  - In the context of a major Florida wetlands restoration project, it was necessary to distribute flows over a land area on a continuing basis in a way that promoted recovery of overland flows and recharge to a more natural condition. Complicating this requirement was the limited available head to drive hydraulic processes, because of the very flat coastal Florida landscape, and the need to deal with all levels of flow from major flood events down to gentle summer storms, all in the complete absence of defined downstream drainage works. A substantial literature review was conducted to evaluate prior approaches to this problem. Parallels were discovered, principally in the agricultural literature, but closely similar projects were not encountered. Solutions considered ranged from concrete hydraulic structures with energy dissipation and overflow weir systems, to simple trenches orthogonal to the landform gradients. It was concluded that although they might be effective, concrete structural options were costly, were prone to excessive head losses, and did not lend themselves to integration into the natural landscape. Overflow trenches were attractive in their simplicity, but raised the specter of eventual cut-down and development of preferential flow paths rather than development of broad wetland areas. The preferred solution consisted of long spreader berms with numerous controlled overflow points. This option not only integrates nicely with the prevailing landscape, but can be adapted in the long term as management of the system is adjusted to meet the needs of the evolving ecosystem during its recovery period.

AB  - The arrival of the Chinese mitten crab to the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin Delta (Bay-Delta) ecosystem has been a source of widespread concern. This crab has spread from its native range, in China, to coastal ecosystems throughout Europe and, most recently, into North America. The Chinese mitten crab population in California has exploded within the last decade to cover hundreds of miles of the Bay-Delta and its tributaries. The Chinese mitten crab is a large, catadromous crab, moving from freshwater habitats where it spends its juvenile years to saltwater habitats in order to reproduce. In other countries into which this species has been introduced, the abundance and behavior of the crab has caused detrimental impacts to fisheries and loss of bank stability in areas where it burrows. Through a grant from the Water Resources Center, we set out to examine the ecology, distribution, and economic and ecological impacts of the Chinese mitten crab in the fresh and saline waters of San Francisco's South Bay. The Chinese mitten crab offers excellent opportunities to: 1) study the population dynamics of an invasive species; 2) examine differences and similarities for this organism between its native and new environments; and 3) use research findings to make recommendations for understanding and control of this organism. We surveyed the tributaries and main body of South San Francisco Bay in order to examine the ecology and impacts of the Chinese mitten crab. We studied distribution and abundance of juvenile crabs by establishing 72 monitoring sites throughout the salinity gradient of several major South Bay tributaries. These sites were used in 1995, 1996 and 1999 to collect population and habitat data. Adult crabs in the South Bay were monitored using otter trawls over the same three-year period. Population parameters of mitten crabs, including size and sex ratios, were examined. We quantified habitat preferences of the mitten crab by examining stream characteristics including substrate type, vegetation type, and salinity. Gut contents were analyzed in order to examine dietary habits and dietary shifts with age, and frequent behavioral observations of crabs were made to confirm dietary and habitat preference data. In order to examine impacts to banks and levees, we examined burrowing by juvenile crabs and quantified sediment removal from burrowing by estimating burrow density and sediment removed per burrow. The potential impacts of Chinese mitten crab on two species of freshwater crayfish were studied using a combination of behavioral observations, laboratory experiments and surveys of the commercial crayfish industry. We found mitten crabs to be broadly distributed throughout the freshwater tributaries of the South Bay, with the distribution spreading over the three years we monitored these sites. Adult mitten crabs were also found in the main body of the bay, with gravid (egg-carrying) females appearing between November and May of each year. Juvenile mitten crabs preferred intertidal sections of streams that had banks with high clay content and abundant vegetation overhanging or growing on the banks. Gut content analysis of mitten crabs revealed a high proportion of vegetative matter, with low amounts of invertebrates, regardless of the size of the crab or the habitat from which it was collected. Abundance of Chinese mitten crab also increased over time, as seen by a continuous increase in burrow densities: densities reached a high of 18/ m2 at one site in 1995 and 1996, and densities exceeded 30 burrows/ m2 at two sites in 1999. Densities exceeding 30 burrows/ m2 are considered to be damage-causing levels in other areas into which the crab has been introduced. Research into the impacts of Chinese mitten crabs on crayfish populations produced mixed results: based on behavioral observations, crabs and crayfish in the South Bay were found to co-occur; crayfish industry surveys revealed concern regarding potential competition of crayfish and mitten crabs; and experimental interactions suggested possible habitat competitio between adults of crayfish and mitten crabs. We present these findings in coordination with studies occurring in the North Bay, the Delta and throughout California which show that the Chinese mitten crab is quickly spreading throughout all of northern California, and has recently reached southern California through the state's aqueduct system. In addition, the sheer abundance of the crab has created significant impacts on the state's water projects. In particular, efforts to minimize impacts to fish from water project turbines and pumps have been seriously impeded by the crabs clogging these systems during their fall migration. The results of our research include important findings for the spread of the organism, similarities and differences between its ecology here and in its native range, and impacts on physical and biological characteristics of San Francisco Bay. We have shown that the mitten crab population has exploded in the South Bay as well as throughout the Bay-Delta region. The highest densities of mitten crab burrows are currently restricted to intertidal segments of the banks and levees; however, at some locations within these areas, bank slumping and erosion already are significant. We believe that there is cause for concern for impacts on freshwater crayfish, although more research needs to be done to quantify these impacts. Given the widespread distribution, abundance, and lack of specialized predators for the Chinese mitten crab, we believe complete control of this species would be extremely difficult and costly. A more effective strategy will be to focus control in specific regions where the crab is producing costly and damaging effects, such as the fish protection programs at state water projects. State and private parties have discussed commercialization of the mitten crab for consumption here or in Asia, and this option could provide an effective, though controversial, method of control. Our findings suggest that the mitten crab is here to stay as yet another member of San Francisco's evolving non-indigenous communities.

AB  - Coastal erosion is common along the unconsolidated shoreline of northern France where coastal dunes frequently form a natural barrier protecting the reclaimed lands of the Coastal plain from marine flooding. A study was conducted on the Sangatte coastal dunes, west of the town of Calais in the Dover Strait, in order to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone to extreme flooding events. The study combines geomorpholoy-based and statistical methodologies by using water terrain elevation and extreme water level data derived from telemetric and tide-gauge measurements. Tide-gauge data from 1965 to 2001 were used to estimate the heights of extreme water levels with return periods of 10, 50 and 100 years by the year 2050, including projected mean sea level rise. Airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data were collected over an area of approximately 14 km(2) and Were used to produce potential flood maps for extreme water levels based on high-resolution Digital Elevation Models. The results show that a low area to the east could be overtopped by high water levels if a significant storm surge occurs at hi,,h tide. In the western part of the dune system, crest elevations are significantly higher, preventing marine water incursions, but the foredune being much narrower in that area, marine erosion may lead to breaching and eventually flooding in the near future. This study demonstrates the interest of airborne LiDAR for coastal management issues by providing accurate topographic mapping by over extensive areas and identifying the zones that are the most sensitive to coastal hazards.

This comparative study of England's and Germany's approaches to managed realignment sought to explore similarities and differences and hence provide insights on its future use. Although consideration of managed realignment is widely perceived as a positive development, important and sometimes surprising differences were found concerning its application. This reflects various factors ranging from the physical landscape and the state of coastal defences to cultural factors. Existing schemes are mostly concentrated on the coasts of eastern England and the German federal states of Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Managed realignment in England, and to some extent on Germany's Baltic Sea coast, seems driven by longer term factors, such as the desire to create more sustainable flood defences and to provide new intertidal habitats, although these are often combined with the more immediate need to upgrade defences. On Germany's well-defended North Sea coast, managed realignment has only been undertaken for specific compensation reasons, although broader conservation concerns might become an important future driver for managed realignment in summer polders. Thus managed realignment is now firmly on the agenda in both countries, reflecting a radical departure from the recent past, in which protection was the only possible response. However, application is likely to differ significantly both between and within these countries.

AB  - Conference Title: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE) Conference Start Date: 2015, Nov. 27 Conference End Date: 2015, Nov. 29 Conference Location: Penang, Malaysia There were a total of 58 events of natural disaster in Malaysia for the period between years 1980 to 2010 that claiming a total of 1,239 lives of the 640,000 people affected. These data were based on statistics provided by United Nation Officer for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). From all different categories of natural disasters considered, flood accounted for over half the registered events. Floods contribute to 8 out of 10 disaster events with the highest human exposure and affect over 85 % of all the disaster-stricken people. Floods are thus the primary hazard which affecting Malaysia, in particular the west coast of Peninsular. Therefore, an accurate and reliable flood prediction model is very much needed to provide early warning for residents nearby flood locations for evacuation purposes. However, current trends in flood prediction only involve flood modeling because no prediction time was mentioned and discussed. Furthermore, in Malaysia there is none of flood model or flood prediction model developed yet. An existing system in the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia is only the alarming system which alarms the users only when the water level exceeds the danger limit. Based on these scenarios, the research objective is to obtain a flood water level prediction model for Pahang flood prone area using Neural Network Autoregressive Model with Exogenous Input (NNARX) structure. The samples used for model training, model validation and model testing were carefully selected. In order to obtain good flood water level prediction model, all samples must be the data when flood events happened. All samples were real-time data that were obtained from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia upon special request. From carefully selected samples, several optimal flood prediction times were suggested for flood location in Pahang. Model validation and model testing were conducted to observe the prediction performances. The optimal prediction time was selected based on the results of prediction performances. Results show NNARX model successfully predicted flood water level ahead of time.

AB  - The article presents the results of macrophytobenthos of the Glubokaya Spit area in Dzharylgach National Nature Park (Dzharylgach Island). It was revealed that the bottom vegetation is represented by the poly-dominant community Cystoseira barbata (Stackh.) C. Agardh - Codium vermilara (Olivi) Delle Chiaje &#43; Laurencia coronopus J. Agardh &#91;with a projective cover (PC) of 70-90&#37;&#93; and the mono-dominant C. vermilara community (PC 80-100&#37;). This is the first record of the Cystoseira and Codium communities in the marine area adjacent to the central part of Dzharylgach Island. These communities inhabit anthropogenic solid substrates at the depth of 0.52.5 m with a total area of about 100 m<sup>2</sup>. In total, 30 species of macroalgae (comprising one-third of all macroalgae species registered for Dzharylgach Bay) were identified: Rhodophyta - 16 species (53&#37;), Chlorophyta - 8 (27&#37;), and Ochrophyta (Phaeophyceae) - 6 (20&#37;). All of them are registered in the Cystoseira community; in the Codium community only 10 species were found. Algoflora of the investigated area is predominantly oligosaprobic (63&#37; of species); according to salinity, marine species dominate (63&#37;). The rare fraction includes 8 species (7 species are listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine and one species in the Black Sea Red Data Book); 11 species are first cited for Dzharylgach Bay. The biotope formed by those macrophyte communities is subject to EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the Bern Convention. In the area where mobile sandy soils dominate, the formation of a quasi-natural vegetation is noted locally on anthropogenic hard substrate. Therefore, for the protection and reproduction of such communities, besides increasing the reserved water area, it is advisable to consider constructing artificial reefs off the coast of Dzharylgach National Nature Park.

AB  - The Delta Project is in its final stage. In 1974 it was subjected to political reconsideration, but it is scheduled now for completion in 1987. The final touches are being put to the storm-surge barrier and two compartment dams that divide the Oosterschelde into three areas: one tidal, one with reduced tide, and one a freshwater lake. Compartmentalization will result in 13% of channels, 45% of intertidal flats and 59% of salt marshes being lost. There is a net gain of 7% of shallow-water areas. Human interventions with large scale impacts are not new in the Oosterschelde but the large scale and short time in which these interventions are taking place are, as is the creation of a controlled tidal system. This article focusses on the area with reduced tide and compares resent day and expected characteristics. In this reduced tidal part salt marshes will extend by 30-70%; intertidal flats will erode to a lower level and at their edges, and the area of shallow water will increase by 47%. Biomass production on the intertidal flats will decrease, with consequences for crustaceans, fishes and birds. The maximum number of waders counted on one day and the number of ‘bird-days' will decrease drastically, with negative effects for the wader populations of western Europe. The net area with a hard substratum in the reduced tidal part has more than doubled. Channels will become shallower. Detritus import will not change significantly. Stratification and oxygen depletion will be rare and local. The operation of the storm-surge barrier and the closure strategy chosen are very important for the ecosystem. Two optional closure strategies can be followed without any additional environmental consequences. It was essential to determine a clearly defined plan of action for the whole area, and to make land-use choices from the outset. How this was done is briefly described.

AB  - Abstract. The Kapuas River delta is a unique estuary system on the west coast of Borneo Island, Indonesia. Its hydrodynamics is driven by an interplay between storm surges, tides, and rivers discharge. These interactions are likely to be exacerbated by global warming, leading to more frequent compound flooding in the area. The mechanisms driving compound flooding events in the Kapuas River Delta remain, however, poorly known. Here we attempt to fill this gap by assessing the interactions between river discharges, tides, and storm surges and how they can drive a compound inundation over the riverbanks, particularly within Pontianak, the main city along the Kapuas River. We simulated these interactions using the multi-scale hydrodynamic model SLIM. Our model correctly reproduces the Kapuas River’s hydrodynamics and its interactions with tides and storm surge from the Karimata Strait. We considered several extreme scenario test cases to evaluate the impact of tide-storm-discharge interactions on the maximum water level profile from the river mouth to the upstream part of the river. Based on the maximum water level profiles, we could divide the main branch of the Kapuas River’s stream into three zones, i.e., the tidally-dominated region (from the river mouth to about 4 km upstream), the mixed-energy region (from about 4 km to about 30 km upstream) and the river-dominated region (beyond 30 km upstream). Thus, the local water management can define proper mitigation for handling compound flooding hazards along the riverbanks by using this zoning category. The model also successfully reproduced a compound inundation event in Pontianak, which occurred on 29 December 2018. For this event, the wind-generated surge appeared to be the dominant trigger.

AB  - An intensive shrimp culture in Thailand has rapidly expanded especially along the coast during the last decade. Excessive feed basically given during the culture causes water and sediment in the pond to contain organic matter and nutrients in high concentration. After harvesting, discharging sediment is prohibited; however, pond water is mostly discharged directly to natural water resources without any effective treatment. The nutrient load discharged from shrimp ponds can form significant source of nutrients causing pollution and eutrophication in littoral areas of Thailand. The possibility of a subsurface-flow constructed wetlands application for treating shrimp pond effluent containing high salinity was studied. An experimental-scaled model planted with Acrostchum aureum (mangrove fern) in gravel was studied by comparison with one containing only gravel. The results showed that models can reduce suspended solids, biochemica oxygen demands, total organic carbon, tote! nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorous (T-P) up to 84%, 91 %, 46%, 48% and 31%, respectively. Higher removal efficiencies for TOC, T-N and T-P of the planted model compared with the gravel model were clearly found.

AB  - On the base of data of laboratory experiment the transformation of waves above reefs was investigated. The possibility of essential decreasing not only wave height, but the mean period of waves was testified. It was revealed that a system of two reefs better reduces the mean wave period. The decreasing of the mean wave period depends on the distance between the reefs. It was shown that submerged structures can influence on transport of sediments due to change of asymmetry of waves passing above them.

AB  - A multidisciplinary project on an archaeological site on the Mitchell River, which feeds into Chocta whatchee Bay on the Florida panhandle. was designed to understand human adaptations to a dynamic hydrological environment during the Middle and Late Archaic period (ca. 8000-3000 B.P.). Now in a freshwater environment, on a sandy terrace above the Mitchell River floodplain, the Mitchell River I archaeological site contains an oyster-shell midden and other features indicating human exploitation of an estuarine environment. Estuarine exploitation at the site occurred over a long span of time,from around 7300 to 3400 2cal B.P., although the site was abandoned two or three times over the millennia. The site was more permanently abandoned after 3400 B.P. Because estuarine shellfish, such as oysters,are low trophic level species, they have been considered marginal resources, and archaeologists modeling collector strategies assume that people will not travel far to obtain them. Under an optimal foraging model, estuarine resources should have been closer to the site than at present. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to address whether a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand had produced estuarine conditions in the Mitchell River floodplain during the Archaic. Using microfossils and stratigraphy from a dated core taken in the floodplain due South of the site, the project members attempted to correlate the changing paleoenvironment with human occupation and abandonment of the area. Results indicate that,at ca. 7300 cal B.P., when the Mitchell River I site was first inhabited, the floodplain was a shallow, open, sedge marsh. The site inhabitants must have traveled some distance to gather the oysters and other estuarine species that were discarded oil the site. The earliest occupation was brief, but the site was reoccupied between 5900 and 5300 cal B.P., when the floodplain had become a Taxodium/Nyssa swamp. Site deposits indicate intensive exploitation of oyster and to a lesser extent Rangia, which may have been closer to the site than at 7300 B.P. but still would have required some travel. At some point, the mouth of the Mitchell River was forced eastward, and the bayhead delta, recognized as a 2-meter-deep wedge of sand in the core. was located adjacent to the site. By 4700 cal B.P., brackish water conditions prevailed, although direct evidence of oyster beds in the immediate area is lacking. Unfortunately, scouring of the core sediments sometime after 4700 cal B.P. destroyed the paleoenvironmental record for the last part of the Archaic occupation of the site. However, some evidence in Core 1, along with research elsewhere on the Florida panhandle, suggests that catastrophic storms may have played a part in the more permanent abandonment of the site after 3400 B.P.

AB  - <jats:p>Hurricane Alicia moved inland over the Texas coast during the night of August 17, 1983 creating waves and surges in the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent bays. Waves eroded beaches and dunes and surges overtopped low-lying areas of barrier islands and inland areas adjacent to the bays behind the barriers. A three-day survey of field evidence of water levels and flow directions was carried out one week after the storm. Physical evidence, such as the elevation of debris lines, water marks in buildings and debris caught on fences was used along with additional data from tide gages operating in the area to estimate the maximum flood levels and flow directions associated with the storm. Before and after aerial photography was used to obtain data on beach recession, retreat of the vegetation line behind the beach and extent of oyerwash deposits. The evidence gathered shows that the barrier islands were overtopped from front-to- back in some areas and from back-to-front in other areas with quite different results. There was little or no beach erosion to the left of the storm as it came ashore; however, serious beach erosion occurred for 18 miles (29.0 km) to the right of the storm and there was significant erosion for 55 miles (88.5 km) to the right of the storm. Maximum water levels in the Gulf, including the effects of normal tides and storm effects, were 9 to 11 feet (2.74 to 3.35 m) and maximum water levels along the nothern portion of Galveston Bay were 11 to 14 feet (3.35 to 4.27 m).</jats:p>

AB  - Deltas are a special type of alluvial estuaries, which are complex systems. They form the interface between the terrestrial drainage system and the sea. Deltas have multiple functions: morphologic, hydraulic, hydrologic, ecologic and socio-economic. They are also the areas where different sources of energy converge: tidal energy, wind energy, potential energy from freshwater and sediments, and solar energy to feed the biotic system. The dissipation of all this energy has created a unique environment, with very special tidal and morphologic characteristics. One would expect that such a complex system is difficult to describe in simple mathematical terms, but the opposite is true. If considered at the right scale, deltas and estuaries appear to obey surprisingly simple "laws". For instance: the shape of an alluvial estuary obeys a simple exponential law; the amplitude of the tidal velocity is 1 m/s at spring tide throughout the tidal region; and more surprisingly, this amplitude is the same throughout the world. If left undisturbed, estuaries tend to become "ideal" estuaries, where the tidal wave is undamped, propagating as a simple shallow water wave. As a result, there is also simplicity in the process of salt intrusion and the mixing of substances in estuaries. There are two important research questions related to this surprising simplicity. The first is of course the understanding of the more fundamental physical laws behind this surprising simplicity and uniformity; the second is how to predict the behaviour of estuaries in poorly-gauged regions, because this simplicity may help us to predict how estuaries behave when we have very limited knowledge on the ground. In this presentation, examples are given of two major deltas where predictive equations appear to work remarkably well. Copyright © 2013 IAHS Press.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Russian tanker Nakhodka spilled approximately 86,600 kiloliters of heavy C oil in the Sea of Japan on January 2, 1997. By this accident, more than 2,000 kilometers of coastline along the Sea of Japan has been affected. Spilt oil was stranded on a 4-kilometer sand beach from Katano to Shioya on January 7. Soon after the oil beached, recovery works were done by heavy machinery without taking account of plant vegetation. These recovery works were completed with a large amount of oil mixed in with the sand. Plant vegetation on this beach was seriously damaged. One year after the oil spill, many parts of the plant vegetation disappeared here and there on this beach. It has become clear that plant vegetation plays a great role in protecting sand beach from erosion., Observing this case, environmental sensitivity of sand beaches should be classified into two groups: one is sand beach with plant vegetation, the other is without plant vegetation. The former is more sensitive.

AB  - Geomorphologic and chronostratigraphic investigations in various coastal localities along the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast, from Bahia Vera (44 degree S) in the north to San Julian (49 degree S) in the south, confirm a rich sequence of Holocene beach ridge systems and littoral and valley-mouth terraces. Beach ridges are present up to 10m above current highest tide level (hTw) and date to the early mid-Holocene transgression maximum. Beach-ridge deposits represent high-energy, wave dominated coastal environments, whereas valley-mouth terraces and littoral terraces (elevations of 5.5-6.5m above hTw) developed in wave-protected coastal environments. The surface elevation of these littoral forms suggest that the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast is likely undergoing a slow glacio-isostatic uplift on the order of 0.3-0.4mm/a since the mid-Holocene. The early Holocene sea-level rise reached the modern coastline by 8100 14C years ago (c. 8600cal BP) at the latest. Sea level at that time was most likely near its present position. The Holocene transgression maximum lasted from 6900 to at least 6200 14C BP (c. 7400 to 6600cal BP), raising relative sea level to about 2m to a maximum of 3m above the present level, after which sea level declined to the present level. Two significant sea-level falls of at most 1m occurred: a) between 6200 and 6000 14C BP (c. 6600 to 6400cal BP), and b) between 2600 and 2400 14C BP (c. 2300 to 2050cal BP). We assume, that both significant sea-level falls were predominantly driven by eustatic changes of ocean volume, whereas both thermo-steric changes and changes of tides may also have contributed to these relatively strong sea-level drops. Gravitational changes driven by Greenland ice growth (sensu Mitrovica et al., 2001) may also have amplified any eustatic portion of sea-level fall. The trend of a general sea-level decline since the mid-Holocene transgression maximum seems to be predominantly glacio-isostatically driven.

AB  - Near-field tsunami propagation both in shallow water environments and bore-like wave propagation on land are conducted in this study to obtain fundamental knowledge on the tsunami hazard potential in the city of Padang, Western Sumatra, Republic of Indonesia. As the region proves a huge seismic moment deficit which has progressively accumulated since the last recorded major earthquakes in 1797 and 1833, this investigation focuses on most reasonable seismic sources and possibly triggered near-shore tsunamis in order to develop upgraded disaster mitigations programs in this densely-populated urban agglomeration located on the western shore of Sumatra Island. Observations from continuous Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) systems and supplementary coral growth studies confirm a much greater probability of occurrence that a major earthquake and subsequent tsunami are likely to strike the region in the near future. Newly surveyed and processed sets of geodata have been collected and used to progress most plausible rupture scenarios to approximate the extent and magnitudes of a further earthquake. Based upon this novel understanding, the present analysis applies two hydronumerical codes to simulate most probable tsunami run-up and subsequent inundations in the city of Padang in very fine resolution. Run-up heights and flow-depths are determined stemming from these most plausible rupture scenarios. Evaluation of outcome and performance of both numerical tools regarding impacts of surge flow and bore-like wave fronts encountering the coast and inundating the city are thoroughly carried out. Results are discussed not only for further scientific purposes, i.e. benchmark tests, but also to disseminate main findings to responsible authorities in Padang with the objective to distribute the most probable dataset of plausible tsunami inundations as well as to address valuable insights and knowledge for effective counter measures, i.e. evacuation routes and shelter building. Following evacuation simulations based on rational assumptions and simplifications reveal a most alerting result as about 265.000 people are living in the highly exposed potential tsunami inundation area in the city of Padang of which more than 95.000 people will need more than 30 min. to evacuate to safe areas.

AB  - The Oosterschelde estuary has a special position among the Dutch North Sea estuaries. With relatively unpolluted water and high transparency it combines high biotic diversity and high primary and secondary production. Before 1970 a major part of the water of the rivers Rhine and Meuse flowed into the Oosterschelde. The building of a permeable storm-surge barrier (1986) decreased the exchange between Oosterschelde and North Sea. The construction of two additional dams (1987) reduced the very limited fresh water discharge on the estuary even further. The total effect of these changes was a decrease of the nutrient levels in the water column. The estuary is used intensively for culture of mussels and fishery of cockles. Both zoobenthos groups use together up to 60% (in the western part) of the organic food available in the Oosterschelde estuary. The storm-surge barrier resulted in reduced current velocities and increased sedimentation, accompanied by higher transparency, hence accelerating primary production. This phenomenon is counteracted by the lowered nutrient concentrations throughout the year. In the seventies a preliminary carbon budget study indicated that a substantial import of organic carbon was required to sustain the ecosystem. Later studies did not confirm this hypothesis. In the present paper three different methods are presented to answer the question, if internal production suffices to sustain the foodweb. At first a steady state model is applied, secondly, calculations with actually measured process rates are carried out and, finally, a dynamic simulation model is used. The conclusion is drawn that, before the construction of the storm-surge barrier, primary production of organic matter by phytoplankton is much more important than import, although the latter can not be neglected as additional food source for mussels, cockles and zooplankton. The simulation model predicts that this conclusion will not have to be changed in the future. The Oosterschelde will remain largely a self-sustaining ecosystem. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The Oosterschelde estuary has a special position among the Dutch North Sea estuaries. With relatively unpolluted water and high transparency it combines high biotic diversity and high primary and secondary production. Before 1970 a major part of the water of the rivers Rhine and Meuse flowed into the Oosterschelde. The building of a permeable storm-surge barrier (1986) decreased the exchange between Oosterschelde and North Sea. The construction of two additional dams (1987) reduced the very limited fresh water discharge on the estuary even further. The total effect of these changes was a decrease of the nutrient levels in the water column.

AB  - Borrow pits, dug by industry to provide substrate for infrastructure such as roads and well sites, are prevalent throughout the boreal forest of western Canada yet little is known about their use by wildlife. During field surveys in Rainbow Lake, Alberta, we found that beavers (Castor canadensis) used inundated borrow pits extensively for foraging and over wintering, suggesting that borrow pits increase beaver populations above their natural carrying capacity in industrial landscapes. We visited a random sample of 90 borrow pits in the field and categorized them as having active beaver lodges with caches (n = 16), inactive lodges (n = 13), cutting (n = 29), no activity (n = 13), or as not inundated or not a borrow pit (n = 19). We then used this sample to model where beavers established lodges versus where they were inactive or were only cutting. We found that borrow pits with active lodges had unique characteristics from other pits in our sample and were closer to streams, marshes, and swamps and had greater vegetation concealment from roads. These models can be used by managers to develop methods for increasing or decreasing the abundance of beavers living at borrow pits. Wildlife managers might want to use borrow pits to increase beaver abundance because of the positive effects beavers can have on ecosystems and because beavers are an important source of food for boreal carnivores. For example, we found that wolverines (Gulo gulo) used borrow pits as hunting grounds for beavers and one wolverine denned within a beaver lodge at a borrow pit. Conversely, managers might want to reduce beaver populations living at borrow pits because of the damage that beavers can cause to infrastructure and because subsidized beaver populations might alter predator-prey dynamics. To accomplish this, we suggest reducing available vegetation around borrow pits, isolating new borrow pits from natural wetlands, digging borrow pits where there is less chance of having surface water, filling in borrow pits with substrate, or not creating borrow pits and using a centralized gravel pit or mine for substrate. © 2020

AB  - River valley bottoms have hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological importance and are buffers for protecting the river from upland nutrient loading coming from agriculture and other sources. They are relatively flat, low-lying areas of the terrain that are adjacent to the river and bound by increasing slopes at the transition to the uplands. These areas have under natural conditions, a groundwater table close to the soil surface. The objective of this paper is to present a stepwise GIS approach for the delineation of river valley bottom within drainage basins and use it to perform a national delineation. We developed a tool that applies a concept called cost distance accumulation with spatial data inputs consisting a river network and slope derived from a digital elevation model. We then used wetlands adjacent to rivers as a guide finding the river valley bottom boundary from the cost distance accumulation. We present results from our tool for the whole country of Denmark carrying out a validation within three selected areas. The results reveal that the tool visually performs well and delineates both confined and unconfined river valleys within the same drainage basin. We use the most common forms of wetlands (meadow and marsh) in Denmark's river valleys known as Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) to validate our river valley bottom delineated areas. Our delineation picks about half to two-thirds of these GDE. However, we expected this since farmers have reclaimed Denmark's low-lying areas during the last 200 years before the first map of GDE was created. Our tool can be used as a management tool, since it can delineate an area that has been the focus of management actions to protect waterways from upland nutrient pollution.

AB  - Natural morphologies, such as sand dunes, river mouth bars and wetlands around a river mouth, are formed by dynamic processes of waves, river currents and wind, and are dynamically stable unless a large-scale anthropogenic effect is induced. Their coastal protection and ecosystem functions for maintaining habitats of many organisms were re-evaluated. The sand dune and wetland in front of an earth dike were maintained as they were, and the overall morphology was regarded as a shore protection facility against storm surges. The setting back of the protection line for maintaining a sand bar and a salt marsh was planned for the first time in Japan with the participation of local citizens and stakeholders, and the construction was completed in 2005. These conservation activities are effective not only for enhancing the safety of the area but also for keeping the sustainability, of fishery.

AB  - Coastal regions have progressively become more vulnerable to intense hydrodynamic and atmospheric events, thus raising important questions about their fate in the century of global warming. A variety of natural and anthropogenic factors have contributed to this fragility: eustacy, isostasy, soil compaction, reduced sediment supply and reduced extension of natural defenses (barrier islands and coastal wetlands). With the aim to emphasize the crucial role played by the intense human manipulation of the environment, we provide a brief overview of the state of knowledge on this extremely complex problem, moving from two cases of special importance: Venice and New Orleans. We discuss similarities (causes of wetland degradation and related restoration problems) as well as differences (different economical scales involved in the restoration projects, different risk reduction ensured by wetland and natural defense restoration and, finally, cultural relevance of the environment to be preserved) between these two regions.

AB  - A multitude of research has been conducted across the U.S. on hazard resilience and the need for coastal communities to be able to adapt to coastal storms. Two tools have been created to convey research findings to assist local decision makers as they make future preparations for storm events. The Coastal Resilience Index is a self-assessment tool communities can use to identify their vulnerabilities so they can address these weaknesses before the next storm. The StormSmart Coasts Network is a web-based tool that connects local officials to resilience-related resources, and allows communities to communicate and collaborate between local municipalities, states, and nationwide concerning issues such as coastal storms, sea level rise, and climate change. Both tools demonstrate how application of research findings makes a difference in coastal communities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Three options for dealing with oily debris from oil contaminated shorelines are studied. It is shown that bunker oil does not affect plant life but does kill the invertebrates in the contaminated supralittoral zone. A non-sticky soil surface can be established if treated with a sorbent. Oily debris picked up by hand, composted with sorbents, and conditioned with fertilizers showed a decrease in total oil content of approximately 60 percent after 400 days. The addition of sorbents gave approximately the same rate of biodegradation, whereas the addition of fertilizer alone had a less beneficial effect on oil biodegradation. The use of sorbents did not affect the generation of leachate water from the compost piles. The oil content in the leachate was between 20 and 40 milligrams per liter. Seaweed in the oily debris decomposed rapidly. The volume of the piles was reduced by about 50 percent. Total oil content was approximately constant in the compost piles. The rapidly decomposing seaweed made it di...

AB  - In situ sea state measurements are essential for offshore activities, coastal protection and science (here in example for the validation of numerical models and of earth-or satellite-based remote sensing instruments). Therefore, well quality checked data is a must. Up to now it is difficult to discriminate between outliers and extreme waves in raw surface wave displacement time series. A consequence of this fact is the uncertainty of the correctness of the maximum wave height in a time period and of extreme waves at all. A first approach method has been developed considering some physically motivated single-wave features. Aim of the development in progress is a fully automated procedure to ensure the sea state time series quality in regard of the discrimination of outliers and extreme waves; in consequence this could also increase the reliability of in situ extreme wave statistics.

AB  - One quarter of the European Union's coast is currently eroding despite the development of a wide range of measures to protect shorelines from eroding and flooding. The prospect of further sea level rise and the heritage of mismanagement in the past imply that coastal erosion will be a growing concern in the future. The European Commission, DG Environment, has recently initiated a project focusing on policy advice for proper management of the phenomenon "coastal erosion". This policy advice will be addressing policy makers at the European, national, provincial and local level and will build on national legislation and practical experiences in policy execution to ensure harmonisation and feasibility. A consortium led by the Dutch Institute for Coastal and Marine Management (RIKZ) has been mandated to implement this project. One of the aims of this research is to facilitate embedding of lessons learned from existing local shoreline management practices into decision-making processes and make this knowledge easily accessible to a wide range of local stakeholders by producing a Shoreline Management Guide (SMG). The objective of this study is to identify successful and unsuccessful strategies, measures and experiments to prevent or manage coastal erosion at a local and national level for different types of coast, doing a review of the practical experience of erosion management and control in Europe. The information will be placed in the context of the entire spectrum of coastal defence measures and highlight the relationship with integrated coastal management (ICZM). The SMG does not aim at providing predefined management strategies, but rather at providing in depth background information on comparable situations and the strategies that were adopted in these cases. Thus, giving a solid basis for tailoring the management strategy to the situation at hand while avoiding measures that have proven to be ineffective or counterproductive.

AB  - Storm surge is one of the predominant natural threats to coastal communities. It occurs frequently and usually results in the most serious economic loss among all the natural hazards in China. The disaster induced by storm surge depends on various influencing factors such as the intensity, duration, and route of the passing typhoon, and thus a comprehensive understanding of natural coastal hazards is essential for the safe and sustainable development of the coastal area. Seawalls are the primary coastal protection facilities, and their protection standard can be established using return periods of the design tidal level (or water level) and design wave. But in China, the correlation between tidal level and wave, which is the parameter may enhance the interpretation of the actual storm process, isn't described in the existing design criterion. This paper proposes a new method to classify storm surge intensity based on PBGLD and PBLD. We illustrate this new method using observed tidal level and corresponding wave height series sampled from typhoon processes in the coastal area of Qingdao and Shenzhen, including the occurrence frequency of typhoon, and to make up the defects of the warning water level. A novel criterion is put forward to grade the intensity of typhoon-induced storm surge, and it forms the foundation to evaluate the storm surge intensity for seawall design. Study indicates that the new criterion gives an explicit notion in terms of joint probability that is easy to operate and fits well to the classification of the surge intensity. The proposed method of storm surge classification using new statistical model can be adopted as a reference approach in many coastal areas affected by typhoon. The data used here is limited, it is recommended that the calculation should only be used for reference, and more verification and improvement may be needed for broader application.

AB  - The INSPECT (Integrated Numerical research System for Prevention and Estimation of Coastal disasTer) system was developed for numerical analysis of oceanographical disaster phenomena in coastal and estuarine areas. The INSPECT consists of three numerical simulation models (Wave, Storm Surge and Tsunami models), their supporting sub-systems and supporting databases. With this system, various coastal protection works can be more reliable designed. The paper presents an outline of the design, basic theory of numerical research and applications of the system. The analysis of tide, Wave, Tsunami and storm surge on the coasts of Shikoku Island in Japan is performed by using INSPECT.

AB  - A new scheme of numerical simulation of storm surge has been developed recently. With this simulation model, abnormal high storm surges generated by large typhoons around the coasts of Japan were well reproduced. Furthermore, numerical simulation model for storm surge inundation is developed to study and prevent storm surge disasters on Japanese coasts. Inundation simulation method induced by overflow, overtopping and dike breach is incorporated into this model. According to the results of this inundation simulation, coastal protection works consisted of hard and soft countermeasures can be designed. This paper presents the application to the Nagoya Port in the Ise Bay. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Over the centuries, London has progressively encroached into the tidal Thames River as it has developed into a "World City". This encroachment has exacerbated the flood risk to new and adjacent land, despite continual upgrading of flood defences. The pressure for further encroachment remains, despite the new threat of human-induced climate change - that is, the combined effect of (1) increased peak river flow in the winter, (2) more intense precipitation events, (3) accelerated sea-level rise, and possibly (4) more severe storms and resulting storm surges. Costly upgrade of defences is inevitable to manage the increased flood risk, and this has caused a re-evaluation of the Thames Estuary's flood defence program. For the first time, managed realignment in urban areas is being considered as a flood management tool. This offers a range of potential benefits including (1) increasing storage for floodwater, (2) improving ecological functioning, (3) improving riverside access for people, and (4) reversing the long-term trend of encroachment into the river. Planned managed realignment can widen the scope for future defence upgrade, but has been limited in urbanised areas. Several projects in London (e.g., Tate Modern and Millennium Dome) have shown that realignment can achieve the benefits described above, which supports the government's recent "Making Space for Water" policy. This study investigates the feasibility of managed realignment in the Thames Estuary. Fragmentation between flood defence and spatial development policies, lack of political support, and riverside encroachment continue to delay urban realignment projects. Successful application will require long-term planning (over decades) that exploits all opportunities for landward realignment offered by redevelopment. With the uncertainties behind climate change and more development in the "Thames Gateway", further research is needed to understand the contribution of urban realignment to any flood management strategy that may be applied to other coastal urban areas.

AB  - ABSTRACT On April 22 and 23, 1988, Shell Oil Company spilled more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil into northern San Francisco Bay from its refinery in Martinez, California. The resulting contamination of more than 11 miles of shoreline, marshes, beaches, and marinas attracted widespread public interest and extended investigation by governmental agencies and elected officials, as the cleanup extended for many weeks. The regional response team (RRT) was asked to host two public forums to present a unified governmental perspective on the incident and to give the public a chance to comment and express ideas for restoration and mitigation measures. This paper describes how this process was carried out and makes observations on the importance of the SPCC program. Reviewing a regional response to a discharge is a possible RRT activity described in the National Contingency Plan. This effort presents an opportunity for the RRT to solicit public views for use in its evaluation process.

AB  - Tsunami-tide interactions in the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) were investigated by taking into account the effects of tidal currents on the tsunami propagation in terms of the arrival time and the run-up heights along the coast of SIS. The initial tsunami wave profile was introduced by the possible Tokai-Tonankai-Nankai Earthquake of the magnitude Mw9.0, which is equivalent to that of 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Numerical experiments with four different tidal phases, flood, ebb, high, and low, reveal that the water depth changes due to tides affect the tsunami propagation in terms of heights and arrival time. During high tides, the tsunami propagates faster and reaches higher than during the low tides. In addition, during the flood tides with rising water level, tsunami propagates faster than during the ebb tides. Further investigation also shows that the tsunami-tide interaction changes the tsunami signal such that the tsunami-only spectra shifts the spectral peaks after considering the tsunami-tide interactions. Local oscillation modes characterized by local bathymetry and topography shift to higher frequency modes due to the non-linear tsunami-tide interaction. To reduce the uncertainties involved in tsunami predictions and coastal defenses and management, it is strongly recommended to simulate tsunamis together with tides in shallow water environments.

AB  - The land reclamation area of Saemangeum in Korea is located between 126°10′∼126°50′; and 35°35'N36°05'N at the western coast of the Korea. The 33 km sea dike and 40,100 ha reclamation area is being constructed in the Saemangeum area in Korea. Such large-scale coastal land reclamation project will certainly influence the marine environment and ecosystem in this area. It is necessary that the submerged breakwater could minimize and compensate the negative impacts in the marine environment and ecosystem caused by the marine construction. The submerged breakwater can function as a artificial fish reef and disaster prevention of the coast. The purpose of the study is to investigate hydraulic characteristics by change in the crest width, wave transmission, and porosity in case of permeable, impermeable, and horizontal plate submerged breakwater. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Atoll islands' alongshore sediment transport gradients depend on how island and reef morphology affect incident wave energy. It is unclear, though, how potential atoll morphologic configurations influence shoreline erosion and/or accretion patterns, and how these relationships will respond to future sea-level rise (SLR). Schematic atoll models with varying morphologies were used to evaluate the relative control of individual morphological parameters on alongshore transport gradients. Incident wave transformations were simulated using a physics-based numerical model and alongshore erosion and accretion was calculated using empirical formulae. The magnitude of the transport gradients increased with SLR: initial erosion or accretion patterns intensified. Modeled morphologic parameters that significantly influenced alongshore transport were the atoll diameter, reef flat width, reef flat depth, and island width. Modeled atolls with comparably small diameters, narrow and deep reef flats with narrow islands displayed greater magnitudes of erosion and/or accretion, especially with SLR. Windward island shorelines are projected to accrete toward the island's longitudinal ends and lagoon due to SLR, whereas leeward islands erode along lagoon shorelines and extend toward the island ends. Oblique island, oriented parallel to the incident deepwater wave direction, shorelines are forecast to build out leeward along the reef rim and toward the lagoon while eroding along regions exposed to direct wave attack. These findings make it possible to evaluate the relative risk of alongshore erosion/accretion on atolls due to SLR in a rapid, first-order analysis.

AB  - <jats:p>The German North Sea Coast is relatively short (370 km); its shape is extremely irregular with estuaries, extended tidal flats, partly protected by sandy islands with deep tidal gullies between them (Fig. 1). In order to gain more detailed information and sufficient knowledge about the variety and variations in this region, the German Coastal Engineering Board (KFKI, Kuratorium fur Forschung im Kusteningenieurwesen) has initiated a high-level and extensive programme, "MORAN", "Morphological Analysis Klorth-Sea-Coast". The purpose and the first ideas of the programme were presented by Siefert and Barthel (1981). Investigations are still under way. It is of high interest whether the mean height of the tidal flats will rise, if the green house effect results in an acceleration of the mean sea level rise. In that case coastal protection in areas behind tidal flats will have to be changed completely, as then wave energy will no longer be dissipated in front of the coastline and will attack the dikes heavily .</jats:p>

AB  - Kakanj is located in the center of Sarajevo-Zenica basin in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Coal mining began in the mid 19th century. Several underground mines in the area of Trstionica started operating after the end of World War II. Subsidence caused by underground mining are almost always localized on the surface above the underground area with a zone of influence within the area of the mine. Vertical subsidence could cause significant problems and economic losses, but also the positive effects on the environment, as in the case of forming swamp Bistrik, occurred over the mining area of the pit named Haljinići. There are three water bodies formed in this area. The largest onecovers an area of 200x50 m, while the other two ones are smaller and waterless during summer time. Marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions. Swamp Bistrik is on the Adriatic Flyway and it is an important place as Stop Over Site in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 250 million European and Asian migratory birds. Swamp Bistrik is under the process of declaration as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). © SGEM2017. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the effect which big coastal facilities exert on coastal erosion due to waves in Khlong Wan Coast and examine some measures. Field surveys and a long-term simulation with the one-line numerical model indicated that the blockage of silt-andsand supply from the northeast side of the coast by a big groin and the blockage of the supply from the southwest side by a huge detached breakwater has caused coastal erosion. Moreover, because the prediction using the one-line model showed that the beach in the southwest side of an old fishing port will become the most dangerous area, some measures for the coastal protection were proposed. Then, examinations on topographical changes of the beach, wave overtopping rates, etc. elucidate that sand nourishment is the most effective measure.

AB  - Abstract: The reed Phragmites australis Cav. is aggressively invading salt marshes along the Atlantic Coast of North America. We examined the interactive role of habitat alteration (i.e., shoreline development) in driving this invasion and its consequences for plant richness in New England salt marshes. We surveyed 22 salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and quantified shoreline development, Phragmites cover, soil salinity, and nitrogen availability. Shoreline development, operationally defined as removal of the woody vegetation bordering marshes, explained >90% of intermarsh variation in Phragmites cover. Shoreline development was also significantly correlated with reduced soil salinities and increased nitrogen availability, suggesting that removing woody vegetation bordering marshes increases nitrogen availability and decreases soil salinities, thus facilitating Phragmites invasion. Soil salinity (64%) and nitrogen availability (56%) alone explained a large proportion of variation in Phragmites cover, but together they explained 80% of the variation in Phragmites invasion success. Both univariate and aggregate (multidimensional scaling) analyses of plant community composition revealed that Phragmites dominance in developed salt marshes resulted in an almost three‐fold decrease in plant species richness. Our findings illustrate the importance of maintaining integrity of habitat borders in conserving natural communities and provide an example of the critical role that local conservation can play in preserving these systems. In addition, our findings provide ecologists and natural resource managers with a mechanistic understanding of how human habitat alteration in one vegetation community can interact with species introductions in adjacent communities (i.e., flow‐on or adjacency effects) to hasten ecosystem degradation. Resumen: El carrizo, Phragmites australis Cav., está invadiendo marismas agresivamente a lo largo de la costa Atlántica d Norte América. Examinamos el papel interactivo de la alteración de hábitat (i.e., desarrollo costero) en el impulso de esta invasión y sus consecuencias sobre la riqueza de especies en marismas de Nueva Inglaterra. Muestreamos 22 marismas en la Bahía Narrangasett, Rhode Island, y cuantificamos el desarrollo costero, la cobertura de Phragmites, la salinidad del suelo y la disponibilidad de nitrógeno. El desarrollo costero, definido operativamente como la remoción de la vegetación leñosa que bordea a las marismas, explicó > 90% de la variación intermarismas de la cobertura de Phragmites. El desarrollo costero también estuvo significativamente correlacionado con reducción de salinidad del suelo e incremento de la disponibilidad de nitrógeno, lo que sugiere que la remoción de la vegetación leñosa circundante a las marismas incrementa la disponibilidad de nitrógeno y disminuye la salinidad facilitando la invasión de Phragmites. Solas, la salinidad del suelo (64%) y disponibilidad de nitrógeno (56%) explicaron una gran proporción de la variación en el éxito invasor de Phragmites, pero en conjunto explicaron 80% de la variación en el éxito de invasión de Phragmites. Tanto el análisis univariado como agregado (escalamiento multidimensional) de la composición de la comunidad de plantas revelaron que la dominancia de Phragmites en marismas desarrolladas resultó en un decremento de casi el triple en la riqueza de especies de plantas. Nuestros hallazgos ilustran la importancia de mantener la integridad de los bordes de hábitat en la conservación de comunidades naturales y proporciona un ejemplo del papel crítico que puede tener la conservación local en la preservación de comunidades naturales. Adicionalmente, nuestros hallazgos proporcionan a ecologistas y gestores de recursos naturales un entendimiento mecanicista de cómo puede interactuar la alteración de hábitat por humanos en una comunidad vegetal con la introducción de especies en comunidades adyacentes (i.e., efectos de flujo o adyacencia) para acelerar la degradación del ecosiste a.

AB  - Douro River reaches the coast in northern Portugal, south of the city of Oporto. Although its estuary has been used for centuries as the main thoroughfare for the commerce of port wine, ship access through its entrance has always suffered from safety problems. In the past decades, important morphological modifications have occurred, worsening these safety conditions, and forcing the closure of the estuary entrance to navigation for a significant part of the year. Due to a reduction of the wave shelter, earlier provided by the existence of a robust sand spit across the river mouth, the estuary banks have been exposed to direct wave action, giving rise to flooding and important damages during storm events. In order to find a satisfactory solution for these problems, the construction of two breakwaters, that would contribute to protect the mouth of the estuary against the wave action and to promote the sand spit development, was proposed. In the framework of this project, a set of mathematical models was implemented with the objective of helping to understand the local processes, including the current fields resulting from the combined action of waves, tides and river flow, the wave action and sediment transport. In this paper, a description of the main project characteristics and some of the most relevant results of the numerical models are presented. A comparison of wave height results obtained with a numerical and a physical model is also presented. coast: a south solution based on a detached breakwater using high density blocks. The modeling system implemented acted effectively as an added value to the evaluation of the project solutions. It produced important information in what concerns the understanding of the local processes related with the wave propagation, hydrodynamic and sediment transport Taking advantage of the construction of two physical models to evaluate the structures behavior, comparisons were made between numerical and physical model results concerning the wave propagation process. The comparisons of the wave patterns simulated both with the physical and the numerical models showed a good agreement.

AB  - In a context of continued erosion, as is the case for the northwest Portuguese coastal zones over the last two decades, it is common to find urban settlements at risk along shorelines. To protect economical, social and environmental assets it has become increasingly important to effectively plan coastal defense interventions. The sediment grain size is an important parameter involved in these studies and it should be adequately characterized, however it is common to see it categorized by its median diameter, through a reference value. In the paper, seeking for a relation between beach profile and sediment distribution, a contribution is given to the characterization of the sediment grain size at some locations along a stretch of the Portuguese northwest coast, between port of Aveiro and Mira beach. Data from three campaigns conducted between 2006 and 2007 was used in the analysis. The observed values of mean median grain size are within the range 0.39 and 0.57 mm in the study site. The mean beach face slope values are between 0.07 and 0.09.

AB  - Troia peninsula, located on the western coast of Portugal, is undergoing tourism development, including construction of a marina. The marina basin was created by dredging a coastal stretch on the northern terminus of the peninsula on the estuarine side, making available beach-quality sediment for nourishment. A study was carried out to identify potential applications and opportunities to place the dredged sand in a beneficial manner. Many variables were considered in the study design in incorporating pre-project beach profile surveys and sediment sampling. Beach-fill design and placement procedures were proposed according to the purpose and constraints of the particular site, while recognizing the implications of the nourishment in a regional sediment management context. Between October 2006 and March 2007, 286,000 m(3) of sand was placed along four beach sectors with a total alongshore extent of 1,700 in in the vicinity of the new marina and the Troia Roman Ruins archeological site. The emplacements included dune, beach berm, and beach face nourishment, providing restoration of beaches and dunes and also increased buffering capacity in an area of damage to cultural resources of the peninsula. A monitoring program was deployed to assess performance and impacts of the nourishment on adjacent areas, and to identify problems and their causes. The surveys of August 2007 indicate that a significant part of the emplaced sand had been mobilized alongshore promoting the spreading of the fill material to down-drift areas while inducing a general reduction in the beach face slope, and attaining a more natural beach profile.

AB  - The paper gives a brief account of the essential steps integrated and relevant to ocean observation systems, namely: a). development of a series of new sensors and measurement techniques, b). commercialization of the technology, c). implementation of the technology in more than 100 institutions, d). training to the end users and finally e). raising the technology as important part to the syllabus of a few related post graduate courses in university education with the objectives of developing competence among the young generation to undertake related activities confidently. Different types of sensors and observational are available and often times the end users fail to evaluate the suitability of the products matching to the location specific needs at the site. Under such circumstances, many projects requiring measurements in open marine environment are found to fail. In most cases, the details of the failures do not come to surface and hence such failures are repeated. Even though much developments do occur in the basic field of electronics & instrumentation, they do not reflect proportionally in their applied fields, because of the poor interaction and communication with the applied fields. The author describes how he tackled the issue through an integrated approach combining the essential steps harmoniously. The technical contributions are grouped as: a). Development of a series of sensors-many of which with new design concepts, b). A series of data integrators for energy related parameters for better analysis of the environment, c). A series of complex multidisciplinary type data acquisition systems implemented through the commercial firm at many of the prestigious institutions throughout the country, d). A series of national training courses exposing the theoretical and practical aspects of the technology and finally, e). Introduction of academic courses comprising the technical matters in university education at PG levels. The technology developed and implemented in different areas of ocean technology consists of more than 50 different types of sensors and their associated observation systems formulated into numerous projects handled by user agencies. These belonged to different applied areas, namely: Underwater observation of otter trawl systems, Performance evaluation of different underwater dynamic systems, Coastal engg. processes & coastal protection, Marine meteorological & environmental observations, Underwater dynamics around oil prospecting ocean platforms, Propagation of tide and its influence on water mobility and water quality in the associated estuaries, Ship-Borne data acquisition systems, EIA related investigations in port & harbor area, Siltation & sediment transportation in river mouths and Model studies of different coastal engg. processes. Attention has been given to keep uniform signal outputs to the different types of sensors, in order to make easy integration for accommodating different types of sensors into complex multi-signal data acquisition systems. The long practical working experience resulted in the identification of two important aspects to be considered during development and implementation, namely: A. Sensors and observation techniques with location specific features matching to particular environment, and B. Resort to custom designed observational techniques, as far as possible, matching to the objectives of the particular projects. The new sensors and large applications have been elevated to academic levels with new courses as: M. Tech. on Ocean Technology in School of Marine Sciences of CUSAT-Cochin, M. Phil. in SNOM - School of Naval Oceanography and Meteorology-Cochin, M. Sc. in Climate Change Studies in KAU-Thrissur, and M.F. Sc. in Post Harvest Technology in Fisheries University-Mumbai and in many other professional training courses, in order to build up capability among the concerned to take up the related problems systematically.

AB  - <jats:p><p>Wetlands are one of New Zealand’s most important freshwater ecosystems. They are low-lying waterlogged areas bordering rivers and streams and forming quiet edges of lakes, rivers, low- lying floodplains estuaries and harbours. In the last 150 years more than 90% of New Zealand’s wetlands have been destroyed or severely impacted by agricultural developments.  The South Wairarapa region, in the lower part of the North Island, covers 2,485 km2 and is characterised by its expanses of lowland plains and lakes, surrounded by mountainous ranges. Once its wetlands provided important ecosystem services filtering nutrients and controlling floodwaters but they are now under pressure from agricultural land use, including drainage, grazing, nutrient runoff and the impacts of pest animals and plants.  For the indigenous Māori culture of New Zealand, wetlands are often regarded as equivalent to organs that cleanse the body (tinana) such as the kidneys (nga whatumanawa) and the liver (te ate), and therefore represent important sites for purifying and cleaning, by filtering or reducing nutrients, chemicals and suspended sediment before it reaches the Lake Wairarapa. Many wetlands have historical and cultural importance as well as are regarded as source of food (mahinga kai) for the Māori tribes, providing important habitats for a range of culturally important food sources such as eel or important flora for carving such as flax, bulrush, tall grasses and bamboo spike sedges. Māori people perceive their own health as directly linked to the condition of their environments.  This study examines how we can re-purpose / re-configure land use within the region to a more ecologically conscious industry, finding a balance between the existing farming and agricultural practices that the region relies on and a recognition to the cultural practices of the Māori people and its importance to healthy communities and resourceful environments.</p></jats:p>

AB  - Prior to 1986, before completion of a storm surge barrier, the average annual condition of mussels at culture plots in the Eastern Scheldt was better in the western part near the North Sea, than in the central part of the estuary. No such difference was observed in 1986 and 1987. To predict the effects of the barrier on mussel culture, the condition of the mussels, which is an index of growth rate, is analysed and correlated with food sources for the period 1981-84. In the western and central part of the Eastern Scheldt, mussel condition correlates strongly with average annual primary production, but not with chlorophyll-a concentrations. This suggests a direct link between primary production and the growth of mussels. In the western part of the estuary, the relation between condition and primary production has a less steep slope than in the central part. Import of food from the North Sea is suggested to act as an additional food source in the west of the Eastern Scheldt; hence the better condition values of the mussels, also in years with relatively low primary production. The storm surge barrier reduces the water exchange with the North Sea. Reduced import of food and consequently lower mussel condition are expected in the western part of the estuary. Preliminary data from 1987 confirm this prediction. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - This paper describes the damages sustained by a small section of the Vancouver, British Columbia coastline during the passage of a storm in December, 1982. This stretch of protected coastline is characterized by varying types of foreshore treatment. In response to points of concern raised by the landowners in that area, a detailed wave run-up analysis was undertaken. The analysis involved the use of both a parametric wave hindcast model and a numerical refraction technique to arrive at the wave climate at the site. (A)

AB  - ABSTRACT Waste oil from an oil recycling facility in Portland, Oregon, was discharged accidentally into nearby Smith Lake. The cleanup effort was hampered by a number of factors, including vegetation in the lake and subfreezing temperatures. The recovery method that proved most successful consisted of washing the oil toward the shore, where it was picked up by rope mop and belt mop skimmers. Approximately 10,000 gal of emulsified oil were eventually recovered. Topsoil was removed along the shoreline to a depth of 2 in. The property owner (the Port of Portland) also required that 18 in. of soil be removed in the area where the oil had entered the lake. New topsoil was installed and seeded.

AB  - The Mississippi River Delta (MRD) has undergone tremendous land loss over the past century due to natural and anthropogenic influences, a fate shared by many river deltas globally. A globally unprecedented effort to restore and sustain the remaining subaerial portions of the delta is now underway, an endeavor that is expected to cost $50-100B over the next 50 yr. Success of this effort requires a thorough understanding of natural and anthropogenic controls on sediment supply and delta geomorphology. In the MRD, hurricanes have been paradoxically identified as both substantial agents of widespread land loss, and vertical marsh sediment accretion. We present the first multi-decadal chronostratigraphic assessment of sediment supply for a major coastal basin of the MRD that assesses both fluvial and hurricane-induced contributions to sediment accumulation in deltaic wetlands. Our findings indicate that over multidecadal timescales, hurricane-induced sediment delivery may be an important contributor for deltaic wetland vertical accretion, but the contribution from hurricanes to long-term sediment accumulation is substantially less than sediment delivery supplied by existing and planned river-sediment diversions at present-day river-sediment loads.

AB  - Meiofauna composition, abundance, biomass, distribution and diversity were investigated for 31 stations in summer. The sampling covered the whole Oosterschelde and comparisons between the subtidal - intertidal and between the western-central - eastern compartment were made. Meiofauna had a community density ranging between 200 and 17 500 ind 10 cm-2, corresponding to a dry weight of 0.2 and 8.4 gm-2. Abundance ranged between 130 and 17 200 ind 10 cm-2 for nematodes and between 10 and 1600 ind 10 cm-2 for copepods. Dry weight biomass of these taxa was between 0.5-7.0 gm-2 and 0.008-0.3 gm-2 for nematodes and copepods respectively. The meiofauna was strongly dominated by the nematodes (36-99%), who's abundance, biomass and diversity were significantly higher intertidally than subtidally and significantly higher in the eastern part than in the western part. High numbers were positively correlated with the percentage silt and negatively with the median grain size of the sand fraction. The abundance and diversity of the copepods were highest in the subtidal, but their biomass showed an inverse trend being highest on the tidal flats. The taxa diversity of the meiofauna community and species diversity of both the nematodes and the copepods were higher in subtidal stations than on tidal flats. In the subtidal, the meiofauna and copepod diversity decreased from west to east, whereas nematode diversity increased. The vertical profile clearly reflected the sediment characteristics and could be explained by local hydrodynamic conditions. Seasonal variation was pronounced for the different taxa with peak abundance in spring, summer or autumn and minimum abundance in winter. Changes in tidal amplitude and current velocity enhanced by the storm-surge barrier will alter the meiofauna community structure. As a result meiofauna will become more important in terms of density and biomass, mainly due to increasing numbers of nematodes, increasing bioturbation, nutrient mineralisation and sustaining bacterial growth. A general decrease in meiofauna diversity is predicted. The number of copepods is expected to decrease and interstitial species will be replaced by epibenthic species, the latter being more important in terms of biomass and as food for the epibenthic macrofauna and fishes. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Abstract. Coastal lowlands and estuaries are subjected to increasing flood risks during storm surges due to global and regional changes. Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued as effective natural buffers for storm surges by dissipating wave energy and providing flood water storage. While previous studies focused on flood wave attenuation within and behind wetlands, this study focuses on the effects of estuarine wetland properties on the attenuation of a storm tide that propagates along the length of an estuary. Wetland properties including elevation, surface area, and location within the estuary were investigated using a numerical model of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, SW Netherlands). For a spring tide lower wetland elevations result in more attenuation of high water levels along the estuary, while for a higher storm tide higher elevations provide more attenuation compared to lower wetland elevations. For spring and storm tide a larger wetland surface area results in a better attenuation along the estuary up to a threshold wetland size for which larger wetlands do not further contribute to more attenuation. Finally a wetland of the same size and elevation, but located more upstream in the estuary, can store a larger proportion of the local flood volume and therefore has a larger attenuating effect on upstream high water levels. With this paper we aim to contribute towards a better understanding and wider implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation to increasing estuarine flood risks associated with storms.

AB  - Details are presented of a general numerical hydrodynamic model for the generation and propagation of tropical cyclone or hurricane storm surge. The model, known as SURGE, solves the two-dimensional depth-integrated form of the Long Wave Equations using an explicit finite difference procedure, with tropical cyclone surface wind and pressure forcing estimated from an adaption of available models based on U. S. hurricanes. Variations in tropical cyclone parameters as well as the physical characteristics of a coastal location such as bathymetry and details of capes, bays, reefs, and islands are accommodated by the model. The accuracy and stability of the numerical solution have been confirmed by a comprehensive wave deformation analysis. A detailed sensitivity analysis has identified the principal surge generating parameters and the model has been checked against an historical tropical cyclone storm surge. SURGE has been used extensively in the northern Australian region and examples are presented.

AB  - The city of Alexandria is located at the southern Mediterranean coast with a population of about 4 million inhabitants. It occupies an area of about 300 square kilometers, with an increasing demand for development of new land. Alexandria coastal zone suffers from erosion and flooding problems, it also tolerates degradation of water quality due to land-based pollution. The Strategic Action Plan for the Mediterranean countries has identified two hot spots (El-Mex Bay and Abu-Qir Bay) on Alexandria coastal zone. These hot spots have been experiencing a continuous increase in population, development, and environmental degradation. Obtaining a sustainable shore protection and stabilization method which provides environment-friendly coastal solution with less execution cost and duration is an important issue for governors and design makers. One of these methods is the Artificial Submerged Reefs, ASR, which has minimum influence on the environment and sea traffic, in addition to being a suitable environment for the growth of useful fauna and flora. A new numerical tool has been used to predict the sedimentation at the lee of the Artificial Submerged Reefs (Geo-textile Mega-containers sand filling) and its stability. The environmental impacts of Alexandria conventional submerged breakwater, constructed four years ago to protect Alexandria coastline from erosion, is discussed. A comparative analysis between Alexandria conventional submerged breakwater and proposed Mega geo-containers artificial submerged reef is presented. The artificial submerged reef saves fifty percent of the cost and seventy percent of construction time compared to conventional shore protection structure. The artificial submerged reef has also positive impacts on the marine environment. These sustainable environmental techniques will help in touristic development and protection of Egypt coastal zone and will also be applied in light of the objectives set by Alexandria Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (AICZM), Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, Arab Republic of Egypt, 2009).

AB  - We examined assemblage patterns of early life stages of fishes for two major tributaries of the upper San Francisco Estuary: (1) Sacramento River channel, and (2) Yolo Bypass, the river's seasonal floodplain. Over four hydrologically diverse years (1999-2002), we collected 15 species in Yolo Bypass egg and larval samples, 18 species in Yolo Bypass rotary screw trap samples, and 10 species in Sacramento River egg and larval samples. Fishes captured included federally listed species (delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) and several game species (American shad Alosa sapidissima, striped bass Morone saxatilis, crappie Pomoxis spp., and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). As in other regions of the estuary, alien fish comprised a large portion of the individuals collected in Yolo Bypass (40-93% for egg and larval net samples; 84-98% for rotary screw trap samples) and Sacramento River (80-99% for egg and larval net samples). Overall ranks of species abundances were significantly correlated for Yolo Bypass and Sacramento River, suggesting that each assemblage was controlled by similar major environmental factors. However, species diversity and richness were higher in Yolo Bypass, likely because of a wider variety of habitat types and greater hydrologic variation in the floodplain. In both landscapes, we found evidence that timing of occurrence of native fishes was earlier than aliens, consistent with their life history and our data on adult migration patterns. We hypothesize that Yolo Bypass favors native fishes because the inundation of seasonal floodplain typically occurs early in the calendar year, providing access to vast areas of spawning and rearing habitat with an enhanced food web. Conclusions from this analysis have implications for the management of aquatic biodiversity of tributaries to the San Francisco Estuary and perhaps to other lowland rivers. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2004.

AB  - An assessment of land use practices affecting wetland functioning in the Kongahu Swamp, Buller District, West Coast, has been made, based on historical and recent maps and information, discussions with local conservancy staff and landowners, and a site visit to the wetland in March 1998. Although quantitative sampling of vegetation and other biota was beyond the scope of this study, a general map of vegetation types in the wetland was prepared from aerial photographs and ground-truth correlation during the site visit. Current vegetation in the wetland differs considerably from that in pre-European time, and varies considerably between individual properties, reflecting different management practices such as drainage, burning, grazing, and humping and hollowing of pasture. Present vegetation within the wetland is a mixture of kahikatea swamp forest, flax-dominated shrubland and rushland, and oligotrophic bogs with a diverse array of dominant species. Vegetation of the Otumahana Estuary downstream of the wetland includes rushland (salt marsh and freshwater seeps) and highly diverse herbfields. Areas of high conservation value remain, including remnants of kahikatea forest swamp, oligotrophic bog systems, and the Otumahana Estuary, which is in almost pristine condition. Conservation issues in the wetland primarily reflect activities associated with drainage and other alterations of the water regime. There has been considerable shrinkage of the peat in the wetland due to drainage, together with increases in nutrient status due to run-off from grazing pasture, and invasion by weeds after burning. There is anecdotal evidence from landowners for increased siltation into main drains and Blackwater Creek, although water clarity and quality appear reasonable at present. There is no visible deposition of fine sediments in the Otumahana Estuary, although a layer of fresh marine sand suggests a recent intrusion near the mouth. Future management options presented stress the need for co-operation with landowners and the importance of determining the desired management outcomes for a large, diverse ecosystem of this type. Possible mechanisms for protecting areas of high conservation value include land management strategies, co-operative management schemes with adjacent landowners, and purchase of some areas of high value. The vegetation changes in the Kongahu system typify those seen in wetlands throughout New Zealand subject to drainage and other alterations to the hydrological regime. Restoration of such a degraded system may be difficult and require long-term planning, and depends on aspects of wetland functioning that remain poorly understood and require further research. These include the development of desirable hydrological regimes, the ways in which wetlands change over long time scales, and ecological processes such as trophic interactions and food web structure.

AB  - Coastal zones are different from other spaces and require special attention. Integrated coastal zone management is confirmed as the main needed approach to address the particular challenges of coastal zones. "The ICZM Protocol" mirrors the basic principles and objectives of the EU ICZM Recommendation and it fits in the regional sea based approach that the EU envisages. EU Special attention for coastal zones is focused both to positive and negative aspects, concerning population high density of (people), economic activities of strategic importance, biodiversity, climatic and human impacts, scarcity of space, coastal erosion. Tourism industry and unplanned urbanization induced) negative effects in the last years by depreciation of the natural landscape, water quality, sandy dunes, vegetation and marine ecosystem. In this respect coastal management is necessary based on last EU Regulations and Laws regarding ICZM, WFD and Maritime Policies. Strategic approaches of these are based on: ecosystem approach, sustainable resources use, climate change effects evaluation, sound coastal protection, sustainable economic /job opportunities identifying and creation, cultural heritage conservation and traditional activities development, functioning social and cultural system in the local communities access to the coast - for leisure / landscape, general cohesion (accessibility remote coastal settlements). As Pilot area proposed, "Sinoe -Razim lagoon" is the unique aquatic complex in Romania functioning since 1980 as a coastal lagoon with an unstable brackish water regime, connected seasonally with the sea, nominated in the present as "transition water body with shallow water and sandy substrate" as it is define under the EU nomination and classification.

AB  - This paper evaluates the results of two fundamentally different numerical models: DualSPHysics and SWASH, which can be used to assess the ability of coastal defense structures to offset or mitigate the water overtopping and subsequent implications for expected future sea level rise. The models are open source implementations of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and of a non-hydrostatic adaptation of the non-linear shallow water (NLSW) equations, respectively. The small-scale physical experiment of Stansby and Feng (2004) is used to validate and asses the performance of the two numerical models for the case of breaking monochromatic waves overtopping a coastal dike. Numerical and experimental time-histories of water surface elevation are quantitatively compared and numerical velocity fields during the processes of wave breaking and overtopping are analysed in detail. In addition, to further validate the DualSPHysics model, numerical experiments are performed considering the more realistic case of irregular waves using the SWASH model as benchmark. Overall, results provided by both numerical models are generally comparable, although some strengths and shortcomings of each are highlighted. These results can provide guidance in selecting the most appropriate model for a particular situation given specific accuracy requirements and availability of resources.

AB  - The Great Barrier Reef Region which constitutes the north-eastern continental shelf waters of Australia, is an area that is subject to both large astronomical tides and the passage of tropical cyclones (hurricanes). One section of this area, centered on Mackay, is characterized by particularly high tides, with a springs range of order 10 meters. Numerical hydrodynamic modelling is used in the present study to: simulate the M//2 tide to investigate possible effects of the reef barrier on tidal amplification; simulate the passage of a tropical cyclone across the continental shelf; investigate the effect and consequences of non-linear surge/tide interactions. The recent discovery of a major shipping route through the reef in this area and the continuing development of natural resources makes a much more detailed understanding of the region's hydrodynamics essential for coastal engineering.

AB  - Coastal hazards result from erosion of the shore, or flooding of low-elevation land when storm surges combine with high tides and/or large waves. Future sea-level rise will greatly increase the frequency and depth of coastal flooding and will exacerbate erosion and raise groundwater levels, forcing vulnerable communities to adapt. Communities, local councils and infrastructure operators will need to decide when and how to adapt. The process of decision making using adaptive pathways approaches, is now being applied internationally to plan for adaptation over time by anticipating tipping points in the future when planning objectives are no longer being met. This process requires risk and uncertainty considerations to be transparent in the scenarios used in adaptive planning. We outline a framework for uncertainty identification and management within coastal hazard assessments. The framework provides a logical flow from the land use situation, to the related level of uncertainty as determined by the situation, to which hazard scenarios to model, to the complexity level of hazard modeling required, and to the possible decision type. Traditionally, coastal flood hazard maps show inundated areas only. We present enhanced maps of flooding depth and frequency which clearly show the degree of hazard exposure, where that exposure occurs, and how the exposure changes with sea-level rise, to better inform adaptive planning processes. The new uncertainty framework and mapping techniques can better inform identification of trigger points for adaptation pathways planning and their expected time range, compared to traditional coastal flooding hazard assessments.

AB  - A comparative study on climate change and its impacts on coastal aquifers is performed for three Mediterranean areas. Common climate scenarios are developed for these areas using the ENSEMBLES projections that consider the A1b scenario. Temperature and precipitation data of three climate models are bias corrected with two different methods for a historic reference period, after which scenarios are created for 2020-2050 and 2069-2099 and used to calculate aquifer recharge for these periods based on two soil water budget methods. These multiple combinations of models and methods allow incorporating a level of uncertainty into the results. Groundwater flow models are developed for the three sites and then used to integrate future scenarios for three different parameters: (1) recharge, (2) crop water demand, and (3) sea level rise. Short-term predictions are marked by large ranges of predicted changes in recharge, only showing a consistent decrease at the Spanish site (mean 23 %), particularly due to a reduction in autumn rainfall. The latter is also expected to occur at the Portuguese site, resulting in a longer dry period. More frequent droughts are predicted at the Portuguese and Moroccan sites, but cannot be proven for the Spanish site. Toward the end of the century, results indicate a significant decrease (mean >25 %) in recharge in all areas, though most pronounced at the Portuguese site in absolute terms (mean 134 mm/year) and the Moroccan site in relative terms (mean 47 %). The models further predict a steady increase in crop water demand, causing 15-20 % additional evapotranspiration until 2100. Scenario modeling of groundwater flow shows its response to the predicted decreases in recharge and increases in pumping rates, with strongly reduced outflow into the coastal wetlands, whereas changes due to sea level rise are negligible.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies (NOFO) is responsible for oil spill response, planning, and preparedness on behalf of the companies that are operating on the Norwegian continental shelf The responsibility includes initial response offshore, as well as coastal protection and shoreline cleanup. NOFO is developing a plan for regional oil spill preparedness to be implemented in 2001. The plan is based on risk assessment and covers planned oil production activities in the Norwegian offshore sector. Previously, NOFO's oil spill response plan was based on authority requirements and recognized standards. NOFO is now proposing a risk-based approach, aiming to identify the need for oil spill response in different areas of the Norwegian sector. The new approach is based on estimated probability of oil spill situations, dimensioning oil spill scenarios, and oil drift modeling to define arrival time to shore, coastal areas at risk, and amount of oil that may possibly reach the sho...

AB  - The Rafferty-Alameda Project is a water management project in Southeastern Saskatchewan consisting of two dams, a diversion canal, and various mitigation measures. The objectives of the project are to provide flood-control for downstream communities, principally Minot, North Dakota, cooling water for the Shand and Boundary power plants, municipal water supplies for downstream communities in Saskatchewan, recreation, and water for irrigation. The project will allow Saskatchewan to use 50 or 60% (depending on supply) of the water that originates in the basin; this means that there will be less flow available downstream in North Dakota and Manitoba. The need for stable water levels for recreation, an adequate supply of water in the summer months for irrigation, and water year round for the power plants means that the natural distribution of flow throughout the year will be changed to some degree. These changes in the hydrologic regime will cause impacts within the basin. This paper describes the project, outlines its major impacts, and relates these to the changes in the hydrologic regime. The reduction in flow availability during the high flow season will impact on the water quality within the Souris River. The channelization downstream of the Rafferty reservoir will affect the availability of wetlands which are important in waterfowl production; the changes in the flow variability with season will affect the water quality which will have impacts on waterfowl production, irrigation, fisheries, and municipal water supply in Saskatchewan. Because of fluctuation in reservoir levels, the quality of shoreline for waterfowl breeding purposes is not expected to be high. In North Dakota, the reduction in quantity of water available will have negative impacts on the waterfowl and fisheries production characteristics of the wildlife refuges along the main stem of the Souris there. Furthermore, North Dakota could have greater difficulty in maintaining water quality of flows into Manitoba, resulting in probable negative impacts on municipal water usage and fisheries in that province. Expected conflicts between various uses are outlined. The paper concludes that the project has the potential for negative impacts which require mitigation and monitoring, but that overall impacts will probably not be severe, assuming past hydrologic regimes will reoccur in the future. However, monitoring and careful water management will be required to minimize the negative impacts. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rapid deterioration of the barrier coast in coastal Louisiana is resulting in a transformation of low-energy, semiprotected bays into high-energy, open marine environments. Numerical models (ADCIRC and SWAN) are used to hind-cast, nowcast, and forecast wave conditions along south-central coastal Louisiana. Measurements from across the shelf, nearshore, and bays are also used to shed light on the mitigative ability of barriers on the wave and surge field during tropical cyclones. Along western Louisiana the coast is fronted by a muddy shelf, supplied by sediment from the Atchafalaya River. The cohesive nature of this material results in significant damping of waves, particularly during storm events. East of this area the coast is characterized by shell reefs that have historically been dredged for commercial use. Numerical modeling demonstrates that with the reduction in reefs over time, wave energy in the adjacent Acadiana Bays has increased considerably and is likely responsible in part for erosion along marshes fringing the bays.

AB  - Experiments have been performed in the Shallow Water Wave Basin of DHI (Hørsholm, Denmark) within the EU FP7 Hydralab Programme, on large farms of up to 25 heaving point absorber type Wave Energy Converters (WECs). For a range of geometric lay-out configurations and wave conditions (regular, polychromatic, long- and short-crested irregular waves), WEC response and modification of the wave field have been measured to provide data for the understanding of WEC farm interactions and for the evaluation of farm interaction numerical models. A first extensive wave farm database is established. The experimental arrangement and the obtained database are presented, as well as results for wave height attenuation downwave of the farms. For long-crested irregular waves, up to 18.1 % and 20.8 % reduction in significant wave height is observed downwave of the 5×5-WEC rectilinear and staggered farm, respectively. Wave height attenuation is expected to be larger, since in practical wave farm applications WECs will be controlled to extract a large amount of power from the waves, and therefore the array will cause larger wave height dissipation. These findings present the ability to combine the harvesting of energy from sea waves with coastal defence systems, resulting in cost reduction for both applications when WECs operate as multi-purpose devices.

AB  - Hummock-hollow microtopography is characteristic of many freshwater wedand systems. It is comprised of elevated, vegetated hummocks and lower elevation hollows; the latter are usually unvegetated, with reducing conditions in sediments unfavorable for plant growth. This microtopography is also often found in interior regions of brackish marshes, where flood duration is high and salinity fluctuations are prominent. Previous investigation showed this spatial patterning to be relatively stable over time and suggested that these microenvironments are produced by the plants themselves. This study investigates the possible mechanisms and controlling factors of this microtopography and considers the effect of different salinity regimes. We examined microtopographic variability of vegetation and sediment biogeochemistry in two interior tidal marshes, a freshwater-oligohaline marsh and a mesohaline marsh, both of which exhibited fine-scale spatial variability. Within a 2-yr period, the freshwater-oligohaline site demonstrated a labile response of both vegetation and sediment chemistry to interannual variability in salinity and sulfide concentrations, whereas the microscale spatial variability of the mesohaline system persisted. Geochronological assessment of the mesohaline marsh, where microtopographic variability was relatively stable, supported the hypothesis that the formation of the hummock-hollow topography is driven by the plants, rather than developing as a result of underlying physical variability. We propose that brackish marsh vegetation alters the sedimentary environment in such a way as to maximize growth under high-stress, variable conditions. The adaptive advantage of this strategy was illustrated in the accretion rates measured at the higher salinity marsh, which were indistinguishable between the interior hummock sediments and those of an adjacent homogeneous bank marsh. © 2007 Estuarine Research Federation.

AB  - Maximizing recovery in oil and gas fields relies on geological models that realistically portray the spatial complexity, composition, and properties of reservoir units. Present day arid climate coastal systems, like the coastline of Qatar provide analogues for depositional and diagenetic processes that control reservoir quality in ancient reservoirs. Many major reservoirs in Qatar and the Middle East formed under conditions that are remarkably similar to those shaping the Qatari coastlines of today. Major controls on coastal sedimentation patterns are: 1) coastline orientation, 2) wind, wave and tidal energy, 3) climate, 4) relative sea level, 5) depositional relief, and 6) sediment sources. Strong NW prevailing winds (Shamal winds) drive shallow marine circulation patterns, creating four very distinct depositional profiles: windward, leeward, oblique, and protected. Windward coastlines are marked by reef development and intertidal sheet and beach sands. The leeward coast profile is dominated by an eolian sediment supply, as sand dunes are blown into the sea. Along windward and oblique coastlines, shoreface hardgrounds stabilize circulation patterns, creating mud-prone areas of stromatolites and mangroves. Protected coastlines are characterized by finer-grained peneroplid sands and low-relief beaches. Grain size, composition, and dimensions of coastal sands vary due to wave energy. Coastal deposits are equally affected by high-frequency oscillations in sea level. Approximately 6,000 years ago, sea level was about 2 to 4 meters higher than it is currently and the Qatari coastline was up to 10km inland. Most coastal deposits and sabkhas are relicts of this ancient highstand in sea level. Punctuated sea-level drops to present day level have led to the formation of seaward-stepping beach spit systems. Sedimentation patterns and their diagenetic overprint were studied in detail at the coastal sabkha of Mesaieed, which represents an oblique coastal system relatively to the predominant wind direction. Detailed field mapping, radiocarbon age dating analyses, and the integration of geotechnical borehole data, as well as data from numerous shallow pits allowed reconstructing the thickness of the Holocene, the dating and spatial reconstruction of the progradational pattern of the beach spits relative to the varying sea level, and the mapping of the amount and distribution of porosity destroying gypsum. The observed spatial complexity and heterogeneity of modem coastal systems are important aspects to be considered for conditioning three-dimensional geological models. Modem depositional systems along the Qatar coastline, like the one studied at the Mesaieed sabkha, are particularly useful as analogs for conditioning subsurface data sets in geologic (static) and reservoir (dynamic) models.

Moreover numerical algorithms for the detection and separation of ship and wind induced waves will be given. Besides of wave information at certain points and their analysis, for the design of the coastal protection within the harbour also spatial information of the wave distributions are necessary. Therefore numerical simulations with the wave model SWAN of the TU Delft were carried out and compared with the nature measurements. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The systematic laboratory investigation on tsunami attenuation by flexible mangrove models was performed in order to improve the knowledge on tsunami-coastal forest interaction. A sophisticated parameterization method, based on structural and bio-mechanical properties of a mature mangrove (Rhizophora sp.), was developed for the construction of the mangrove models under assumption of stiff and flexible structure. The forest model examined in the laboratory experiments consisted of the selected flexible mangrove models, arranged in different configurations, which was impacted by a tsunami-like solitary wave of varying height, propagating in different water depths. Based on the envelopes of max. wave height and wave forces induced on single tree models, wave evolution modes were determined to identify the source of wave attenuation. The results indicate the dependence of wave transmission on the observed wave evolution modes and relative forest width: the highest transmission coefficient is attributed to nonbreaking waves (ca. 0.78 and 0.55 for forest width of 0.75 and 3.0 m, respectively), while the lowest transmission coefficient corresponds to wave breaking in front of/in the forest model (ca. 0.5 and 0.3 for forest width of 0.75 and 3.0 m, respectively).

AB  - On the Recent lobe of the Fraser River delta peat accumulation has actively occurred on the distal lower dilta plain, the transition between upper and lower delta plains, and the alluvial plain. Distal lower delta plain peats developed from widespread salt and brackish marshes and were not influenced appreciably by fluvial activity. Lateral development of the marsh facies were controlled by compaction and eustatic sea level rise. The resulting thin, discontinuous peat network contains numerous silty clay partings and high concentrations of sulphur. Freshwater marsh facies formed but were later in part eroded and altered by transgressing marine waters. The peats overlie a thin, fluvial, fining-upward sequence which in turn overlies a thick, coarsening-upward, prodelta-delta front succession. Lower delta plain-upper delta plain peats initially developed from interdistributary brackish marshes and were later fluvially influenced as the delta prograded. The thickest peats occur in areas where distributary channels were abandoned earliest. Sphagnum biofacies replace sedge-grass-dominated communities except along active channel margins, where the sedge-grass facies is intercalated with overbank and splay deposits. The peats are underlain by a relatively thin sequence of fluvial deposits which in turn is underlain by a major coarsening-upward delta front and pro-delta sequence. Alluvial plain peats accumulated in back swamp environments of the flood plain. Earliest sedge-clay and gyttjae peats developed over thin fining-upward fluvial cycles or are interlaminated with fine-grained flood deposits. Thickest accumulations occur where peat fills small avulsed flood channels. Overlying sedge-grass and Sphagnum biofacies are horizontally stratified and commonly have sharp boundaries with fine-grained flood sediments. At active channel margins however, sedge-grass peats are intercalated with natural levee deposits consisting of silty clay. These levees reduce both the number and size of crevasse splay deposits. Coal originating from peats of the different environments of the Fraser delta would vary markedly in character. Peats of the lower delta plain will form thin lenticular coal seams with numerous splits and have a high ash and sulphur content. Peats from the lower to upper delta plain will be laterally extensive and of variable thickness and quality. Basal portions of the seams will contain numerous splits and have a high sulphur content whereas upper portions will be of higher quality. Peats from the upper delta plain-alluvial plain will form thick, isolated and laterally restricted coal seams characterized by low ash and sulphur contents. © 1983.

AB  - Disaster management action should be built up through developing metacognitive and action skills. The metacognitive strategy includes aspects of knowledge about when and how to use it by type, specific technique, and response that are assumed related to deal with disasters. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the metacognitive abilities of millennials who are affected by disasters and its relation to disaster management. This study used an observatory exploration and inventory (EOI) method involving 248 respondents in flood-prone areas in the city of Semarang. Data were obtained using a questionnaire-based Guttman model electronic survey as many as 52 statements to inventory metacognition abilities and 48 statements related to actions in flood disaster management. Data were analyzed using Pearson's linear and regression analysis. The non-parametric analysis: Kruskal-Wallis test was run to distinguish metacognitive scores in dealing with food-related problems among millennials groups. For metacognitive awareness, the cognition knowledge was higher than controlling knowledge (p < 0.05). The highest score of metacognitive variables was debugging strategy', which represents a corrective attitude. As described in the value of conditional knowledge, the ability to think fast shows that the millennials are quickly responding and understanding how to act. Most of the respondent actively involved in mitigation and rehabilitation as a volunteer in youth-events such us mangrove planting and cleaning plastic-trash in coastal areas. But, lack involvement of millennial in arranging flood-disaster management make less youth's responsibility during the disaster. It should be overcome to create a comprehensive approach to community-based disaster resilience. © 2021 Gadjah Mada University. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last decades in eastern part of Gulf of Finland has considerably increased frequency of dangerous sea levels rises. The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that over the past 30 years the number of floods in the Neva estuary increased by 1.6 times. Despite the startup in 2010 of the complex structures protecting St. Petersburg from flooding (CPS), dangerous sea level rises continue to cause damage to coastal areas located to the west of the dam. Increasing number of floods, existing gaps in our knowledge about their nature, force of researchers to continue explore this dangerous natural phenomena in order to develop it more accurate prediction.

AB  - Mongolian marmots (Marmota sibirica) live in colonies that consist of numerous burrows and are considered ecosystem engineers. Although once a common steppe species, marmots are now endangered due to overharvesting, which has led to concerns over the impacts of their loss on other species. The decline of marmots likely affected other species given their importance to the ecosystems they inhabit. To examine the role of marmots on small mammal, we established Sherman traps and drift fence arrays with associated pitfall and funnel traps on active marmot colonies, inactive colonies, and control sites in the forest-steppe and semi-desert zones of Mongolia. Overall, we identified 385 individuals representing 11 species of rodents and 1 species of bat in Ikh Nart and 149 individuals representing 2 species of rodents and 1 species of insectivore from Hustai. We found mixed results between diversity indices and abundance of small mammals on treatment and control sites, complicating the picture. During periods of greater precipitation and resulting higher vegetation cover, species abundance and the Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's, and evenness indices all changed significantly, suggesting that the effect of marmots on other species varies based on environmental conditions. © 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)

AB  - The managed realignment (MR) undertaken at Freiston Shore has led to scour around the breaches in the embankment, as well as an unforeseen enhancement in the development of a creek system on the mid-intertidal zone. This was related to the MR being at a lower elevation than the adjacent saltmarsh, causing high flows (3 ms-1) into the MR site during high spring tides; this was followed by a gradual release of the water volume throughout low water (0.2-0.5 ms-1). The width of the channels in the breaches increased by 15 m over 2 months. The majority of the sediment made available was deposited inside the MR site, which acted as an importer of sediment. The creek system on the intertidal zone experienced an increase in annual headward retreat, from 16 myr-1 in the 10 years before, to 450 myr-1 in the 16 months following the MR.

AB  - National Marine Sanctuaries preserve and protect unique national treasures in our coastal environments. They are not immune from threats posed by marine transportation accidents. NOAA has been working with the U.S. Coast Guard and state partners to ensure that emergencies in sanctuaries are met with the most effective and protective response possible. NOAA developed an emergency response exercise called Safe Sanctuaries 2005 (SS2005) to highlight NOAA's ability to deliver data, observations, forecasts, and expertise during emergencies threatening life, commerce, or the environment. SS2005 revolved around an 800-foot cargo vessel carrying 200,000 gallons of fuel grounding near Elbow Reef in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Such a grounding would injure coral habitat and historical artifacts and threaten other resources with spilled oil. This scenario provided a setting for integrating people and capabilities across NOAA. The exercise objectives stressed NOAA's internal and external communications, procedures for deploying technical capabilities during emergencies, and the health and safety of NOAA response personnel. The exercise included a tabletop component in March 2005 and field operations in April 2005. The April field operations demonstrated observation, information processing, modeling and forecast capabilities from across NOAA. Real-time metrological and oceanographic observation capabilities were deployed at the grounding site and integrated with weather and pollution forecasts. A navigation response team surveyed the area in support of salvage operations, providing immediate navigation chart updates. NOAA also joined forces with the State of Florida to survey environmental impacts from the grounding and oil. The information from all of these activities was integrated by a NOAA scientific team supporting a unified command comprised of U.S. Coast Guard, State of Florida, and the private sector. A significant component of the exercise focused on providing training in emergency response management, including the use of the Sanctuaries Hazardous Incident Emergency Logistics Database System (SHIELDS) and the Incident Command System. Training included field staff from multiple agencies, providing an opportunity to build the personal relationships necessary for effective emergency response. A post exercise debriefing helped identify gaps in operational capabilities, areas requiring further research, and training that could enhance future operations. The training, tabletop, and field exercises provided an opportunity to both demonstrate NOAA's operational capabilities and to analyze future requirements.

AB  - The effects of the reed, Phragmites australis (Trin.), growing in a brackish water lagoon, were studied in relation to the grain-size distribution of the substratum. At the salt marshes near the lagoon, the upper soils from the surface to a depth of 20 cm contained much silt-clay. These fine particles were found to be transferred from the river and fish ponds near the lagoon, and to be deposited when the tidal rhythm changed, that is, when the water current stopped. In addition, the fine particles, which were deposited on the bottom of the lagoon adjacent to the marshes, became resuspended as a result of wind-caused wave action, and then were transported and redeposited in the salt marshes at the flood tide. Since the reeds further reduced the water current caused by the waves and tide, the reeds were thought to promote redeposition of the resuspended matter. In other words, the reeds were considered to protect deposited and redeposited particles such as silt and clay from resuspension as a result of wave action by reducing the effects of waves and wind. These processes suggested that silt-clay will become abundant in the substratum of the salt marsh adjacent to the lagoon. © 1988 the Oceanographical Society of Japan.

AB  - ABSTRACT The systematic process by which an oil spill preparedness plan was developed for SSB/SSPC operations in the South China Sea used local wind, current, and weather data in a SLIKTRAK model adapted to estimate the spill costs and risks resulting from a well blowout. The model shows that the Sabah and Philippines shores would be likely to be affected, while the Brunei and Sarawak shores have a low probability. The minimum period in which oil will arrive at any shore is three days after the spill. February to early August are likely months in which a spill will arrive at a shoreline. Spills from late August to January are expected to move away from the coast. Mechanical recovery of spilled oil and chemical dispersant spraying from boats is effective from March to September while natural dispersion is enhanced from September to February. The local environmental data and local availability of vessels and resources greatly influence the choice of mechanical cleanup equipment. An ecological marine macrobenthos survey has been carried out in the Sabah and Sarawak coastal waters. The fundamental aim of the program is to develop quantitative data on the current status of selected marine macrobenthic communities in these areas. This data could be used as a reference for comparison against any future surveys so that any environmental effects or modification resulting from oil spills may be assessed. A coastal resources study along the Sarawak coast also was being carried out to determine sensitive areas in order to prioritise the allocation of available oil spill control equipment and resources. Finally, the roles and development of Shell oil spill cooperatives in this region have been based on the tier concept. Under this concept, SSB/SSPC would be primarily responsible for its own spill as the first tier. It is complemented on a reciprocal basis by close cooperation with Brunei Shell as the second tier. The third tier involves the cooperation of the Shell Companies in Southeast Asia—the ROSE scheme.

AB  - Conference Title: 2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science) Conference Start Date: 2016, Oct. 23 Conference End Date: 2016, Oct. 27 Conference Location: Baltimore, MD, USA The typhoon Morakot struck Taiwan during August 8–10, 2009, and the government statistics analyzed that typhoon brought maximum 3,004mm in three days, and 21 rain stations is over 2,000mm. It claimed 673 casualties, 26 missing persons and 24,950 evacuees are evacuated by the Disaster Prevention and Response Act. The heavy and log period rainfall also triggered multi-hazards; such as: flooding, debris flow and deep landslides, and the economic loss is 6.2billion USD. This kind damage is extreme weather, and we think that climate change will bring huge impacts to nations all over the world. Those impacts including the followings: change in biosphere, long-duration drought, large floods trigger by extreme torrential rain, spatial change in homelands, and food scarcity. The extreme weather induced by climate change is the most direct factor influencing the floods, e.g. the extreme rainfall increases discharge and inundation area, sea level and estuary water level raising induce overbank floods, and land-use abuse and land-slides trigger high concentration of sediment discharge and river bed aggradations. This study aims at the settings of hydrological scenarios due to climate change, evaluation of hydraulic structures (e.g. levees), vulnerability and risk analysis, and adaption strategy and practices. The study area is focused on Kaoping River basin watershed. First, the hydrological scenarios due to climate change are set. Secondly, based on those scenarios, the hydraulic structures are evaluated. Thirdly, the vulnerability and risk analysis are performed. Last, adaption strategy and action plans are proposed by referencing to actions taken by the Netherlands, Japan and USA for improving the capacity of the hydraulic structures of this basin watershed.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Climate change can strongly alter soil microbial functioning via plant–microbe interactions, often with important consequences for ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant–microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress – i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem–climate feedbacks in the coastal zone. </jats:p>

AB  - ABSTRACT Observation of coastal shoreline changes in the Subang District was conducted using Digital Shoreline Analysis System Program based on the satelite images of Landsat TM from 1996 to 2010. The purpose of this study was to determine the distance of shoreline change. Methods used in this study were field survey and regression analysis of shoreline data. The results of this study indicated the existence of a region experiencing accretion and abrasion. The maximum width of accretion of the coast was 1,051.55 meter while the maximum abration was 1,206.83 meter. Coastal shoreline change in Subang District occurred mainly due to the development activities such as residential construction, altering the coastal mangrove to ponds and rice paddies, and sediment transport from the river around Subang District. Keywords: shoreline, Subang District, satelite images, accretion, abration

AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="en">Observations of coastal infrastructure and detailed surveys of physical changes at eight beaches document the impacts of Post-tropical Storm Noel that struck the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia on November 3-4, 2007. The surveys were part of an ongoing investigation of the impacts of major storms on different shore types and their rate of recovery. In addition, flood water levels and wave run-up extent were documented to better define shores vulnerable to these coastal hazards. The area of gale to storm force southerly to southwesterly winds in Noel extended along most of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Waves in excess of 8 m height lasted nearly 6 hours, with a focused direction of 190-220 degrees as they peaked in height. Wave set-up increased water level but it was still about 50 cm less than maximum levels reached during Hurricane Juan. If Noel had occurred a week earlier during spring tides, the damage probably would have been significantly greater in area, and possibly in intensity. Power outages and minor damage from waves tossing debris and rocks across adjacent roads and properties occurred in similar locations as past storms. No official dollar values have been published for the cost of Noel. The worst damage to infrastructure was on the outer coast, in the vicinity of the Lahave River, at Peggy's Cove and scattered locations along St. Margarets Bay. Waves overwashed all shores less than 4.4 m elevation. Backshore dunes were flooded a maximum distance of 84 m from the beach. A low gravel barrier beach crest was pushed nearly 6 m landward and its lagoon shore was extended 10 m. Where backshores were higher, wave run-up extended to elevations of 6 m across vegetated sand dunes and possibly as high as 12 m across bedrock shores. Flood waters reached 1.9 to 2.3 m elevation at lagoons and estuaries along the Eastern Shore and possibly as high as 3.1 m along the South Shore. Most of the beaches still retained their maximum sediment build-up when Noel struck which lessened the wave impacts. Natural dunes were cut back less than 7 m, except where water was funneled through existing dune cuts used as trails, or water turbulence was intensified around artificial structures, such as boardwalks and fences. Channels were cut through weak parts of dunes at Lawrencetown, Martinique and Cherry Hill beaches. A backshore pond along Hartling Bay was completely drained and became tidal when the barrier beach fronting it was breached. The Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia has been retreating landward for thousands of years because of sea level rise. Storms such as Noel cause one small step in that process which varies in intensity depending on the condition of specific shores. For the eight beaches investigated Cherry Hill and Cow Bay continue to rapidly evolve, parts of Lawrencetown and Martinique beaches are now more susceptible to rapid change, Hirtles and Miseners-Long beaches continue to slowly migrate, Conrads Beach is in a phase of building and less impacted, and natural movement of Crescent Beach became more constrained with the addition of rock in response to dune erosion caused by Noel.</jats:p>

AB  - When we think of infrastructure as a category, coral reefs and dunes may not come to mind. Yet, as we realize the social and physical challenges that await us with increasing climate change-driven impacts, we must reconceive what constitutes infrastructure that needs investment and maintenance. Taking an international perspective, the past few years have seen increasing attention and thought given to coordinating efforts to protect both biodiversity and human communities. Recent international cooperation has culminated in the United Nations declaring 2021-2030 the International Decade of Ecological Restoration, coinciding with the already adopted Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, facilitating national efforts to reduce disaster risk exposure. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (March 18, 2015). Both global efforts are unfolding while the Paris Agreement, which is focused in part on avoiding loss and damage associated with rapid changes in climate conditions, is also being progressively implemented.

AB  - This paper describes lessons learned and results obtained while applying a rotary drilling with liner system on conventional rigs, during the planning, design and drilling operation in offshore wells located in the Mexican coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. Due that the cretacic formation named El Abra is composed by naturally fractured limestone and since its structural top (origin reef) has been eroded, it is difficult to detect it. Moreover, the differential pressure between the Tertiary and El Abra, result in several hole problems, such as: severe lost circulation, stuck pipe, cave-ins of holes and bad casing cementing jobs. These problems have increased time and cost in the drilling projects. Continuous searching for alternative solutions with new technology to solve specific problems in the drilling process, lead PEMEX Exploration and Production to apply the non conventional option of rotary drilling with liner, meeting the safety standards established by the company. The applied drilling with liner system, has allowed to drill down to the objective depth with high angle, cement the liner and drill out the following interval horizontally, steering in the reservoir. The system consists of a shoe drillable bit, a float collar, stabilizers, a liner with integral flush connections of high torque and a rotary liner hanger. The results of the technique are presented utilizing a liner of 9 5/8" and a bit of 121/4", also hydraulic analysis, stress generated in the casing and the connections by 75° angle of hole construction, torque and drag, and drilling parameters. A comparison with conventionally drilled wells is performed, pointing out the problems found in the field, the results achieved, and how by applying the technique drilling with liner, savings of 40 days time and 5.0 MM usd per well, have been accomplished.

AB  - A water temperature study carried out at eight stations along the Gironde estuary from 1974 to 1977 shows that: water temperature is constant during late summer and late winter, while it increases in spring and decreases in autumn; then the effect of seasonal changes is such that the water temperature variations reach 7 to 9 C a month. The tidal mixing effect of the fresh and salted water, which is mainly dependent on the tidal coefficient, causes an important daily water temperature variation (up to 2 or 3 C); the increase of tidal coefficients creates a small storage of downstream water below Pauillac, and of upstream water above Pauillac. Water temperature measurements reflect the coming and the propagation of the flood discharge in the estuary, especially in spring, when temperature differences beteen upstream and downtream are important: then the fall in temperature can reach 4 C. Variations are easy to observe upstream but the widening of the estuary reduces them below Pauillac. For the observed floods, one day was necessary to flow from La Reole (upstream limit of the Gironde estuary) to Bordeaux and 3 or 4 days to flow from Le Reole to Pauillac. This time depends less on the river discharge volume than on the importance of this volume compared to that of the previous days: the authors used the raise of the water level at Le Reole between two successive days.

AB  - A current forecast system has been set-up as an aid to executional operations of the storm surge barrier in the mouth of the Oosterschelde Estuary. The system makes use of deterministic models (hydraulic and mathematical) and/or time series analysis techniques. A short description of the system is given, as well as an account for its performance. The application of Frequency Response Functions to forecast (tidal) current velocity is discussed in more detail, the method being applicable for harbors and the like. An average error of almost nil and a standard deviation of less than 10% could be achieved.

AB  - The Severn Estuary in the south-western UK is one of the most tidally dynamic environments on the planet. However, despite this the sediments of the estuary remain relatively understudied with regards to their biogeochemical potential. The aim of this project was to investigate how the constantly changing sedimentary environment in the estuary, in which millions of tonnes of sediment are eroded and deposited over the tidal cycle, affects the prokaryotes within the sediments and the processes they control, and also to determine what effect environmental changes in the estuarine system might have on these processes. The study showed that the sediments of the Severn Estuary have high rates of sediment oxygen demand (SOD) indicating a high degree of organic matter (OM) degradation. However, the sediments have low rates of the anaerobic processes that are expected to dominate in shallow marine systems (e.g. sulphate reduction and methanogenesis), suggesting that most OM degradation must be linked to processes further up the redox cascade. The sediments also showed a lack of microbial guild depth zonation, with methanogenesis occurring above or alongside sulphate reduction. Both of these unusual factors can be linked to the regular re-suspension of the estuary's sediments by tidal action, resulting in large-scale oxidation and mixing of the sediment column and the suppression of anaerobic processes while potentially stimulating aerobic and dysaerobic activity. This same mixing would also distribute guilds of organisms throughout the sediment, creating isolated pioneer populations with a general lack of competition. Re-suspension is also likely responsible for the high cell counts that persist to significant depth around the estuary, as the mixing of sediment and entrainment of OM would produce high and homogeneous cell profiles upon deposition, which in turn can be linked to the high SOD of the estuary’s sediments. Despite this dominance of aerobic and dysaerobic processes throughout most of the estuary some isolated sites do show increased rates of anaerobic processes, particularly at locations that have undergone significant environmental change. These include fluidised mud pools in the deeper areas of the estuary, salt marsh peat deposits at St Brides Wentlooge (especially within the 'activated interface') and Cardiff Bay, an anthropogenic lake and former mudflat environment which shows significant methanogenic potential. Overall this study has shown that the dynamic conditions in the Severn Estuary promote the activity of aerobic and dysaerobic prokaryotic groups over the anaerobic groups traditionally thought to dominate in shallow marine sediments. However, this promotion is not uniform across the estuary, instead varying with topography/bathymetry and the degree of sediment disturbance.

AB  - The sandy barrier island of Norderney located in the German federal state of Lower Saxony. The north-western part of the island is protected against storm surges and erosion by groins and a seawall which borders the city of Norderney. To determine the loading and functionality under design storm surge conditions, numerical modelling of sea state conditions and hydraulic model tests for the seawall were executed. Overtopping rates of up to 120 1/ṡm and maximum loads of 200 kPa showed the necessity to strengthen and heighten the construction. Due to limited space resulting from adjacent buildings, innovative wave run-up reduction wall elements were designed. They limit wave overtopping efficiently and meet the technical demands of coastal defence as well as the touristical needs of an important recreation locality. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Background and aims - The Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the Indian Ocean coastline from Somalia to Mozambique, are considered by Conservation International to be a global biodiversity hotspot - an area of high diversity and endemism under increasing threat. Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term 'coastal forest' has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods - The study area of 18,150 km(2) lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 1999-2002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of 'dense vegetation'. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results - Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of 'dense vegetation cover', which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km(2). Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km(2), of which perhaps only 400 km(2) is moderately-intact dry forest. In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation - Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread 'sand forests' of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined.

AB  - Precious corals have been commercially exploited for many centuries all over the world. Their skeletons have been used as amulets or jewellery since antiquity and are one of the most valuable living marine resources. Precious coral fisheries are generally characterized by the ‘boomand- bust’ principle, quickly depleting a discovered stock and then moving on to the next one. Most known stocks are overexploited today, and populations are in decline. The unsustainable nature of most fisheries is clearly revealed by analyzing all available data. Precious corals belong to the functional group of deep corals and are important structure-forming organisms, so called ecosystem engineers, that provide shelter for other organisms, increasing biodiversity. Yet, their management is usually focused on single species rather than a holistic habitat management approach. This review compares the biology of precious corals as well as the historical ecology and the socioeconomy of their fisheries to improve precious coral management and conservation. The analysis demonstrates that a paradigm shift is necessary in precious coral exploitation, not only to conserve habitats of high biodiversity but also to achieve sustainable fisheries and stabilize a specialized jewellery industry. © 2010 by R.N.

AB  - The causeway-induced mudflat at Windsor, Nova Scotia, was studied to determine the effect of rapid sedimentation on the sedimentological and biological characteristics of an intertidal mudflat. Compared to typical Minas Basin mudflats, the Windsor flat has high water content, (50% vs. 30% wet wt, approximately) small grain sizes, and elevated organic carbon content (0.82% vs. 0.24% dry wt). The two principal infaunal species of the Windsor flat, the amphipod Corophium volutator and the clam Macoma balthica, are less abundant than in nearby typical flats (~840 vs. ~13 000/m 2 and ~640 vs. ~1500/m 2 , respectively), while the polychaete Heteromastus filiformis is particularly abundant at Windsor. Macoma balthica at Windsor grow faster and have a shorter lifespan (~6 yr vs. ~13 yr) than at other Minas Basin flats. Compared to other Minas Basin Macoma, the weight of Windsor Macoma increases more slowly with increasing shell size, possibly an adaptation to the more fluid Windsor sediments.These sedimentological and biological characteristics exist at Windsor nearly 10 yr after the start of flat development and show little tendency to approach typical mudflat characteristics. Our results indicate, therefore, that secondary productivity of Macoma and Corophium could be reduced by about two-thirds for at least a decade in existing Minas Basin mudflats that are covered by Windsor-type sediments as a result of the construction of a tidal power dam.Key words: Bay of Fundy, tidal power, sedimentation, water content, organic carbon, infauna, Corophium volutator, Macoma balthica, growth, mortality

AB  - The objective of this research is to obtain generic relations between attenuated wave heights and various vegetation and topographical scenarios. Subsequently, it is aimed to find out what is the actual cost profit of a dike construction behind a mangrove zone comparing to the case when mangroves are absent. The graphs and formulas developed in this research may serve as a first approximation during feasibility studies or conceptual designs of a coastal dike incorporating mangrove vegetation. They allow calculating the design wave height attenuated by site specific or planned for restoration mangrove forests, for different design met-ocean conditions. Calculated wave reduction coefficients can be later on translated to the cost savings of a coastal dike raised behind the mangrove forests.

AB  - The goal of mangrove restoration projects should be to improve community structure and ecosystem function of degraded coastal landscapes. This requires the ability to forecast how mangrove structure and function will respond to prescribed changes in site conditions including hydrology, topography, and geophysical energies. There are global, regional, and local factors that can explain gradients of regulators (e.g., salinity, sulfides), resources (nutrients, light, water), and hydroperiod (frequency, duration of flooding) that collectively account for stressors that result in diverse patterns of mangrove properties across a variety of environmental settings. Simulation models of hydrology, nutrient biogeochemistry, and vegetation dynamics have been developed to forecast patterns in mangroves in the Florida Coastal Everglades. These models provide insight to mangrove response to specific restoration alternatives, testing causal mechanisms of system degradation. We propose that these models can also assist in selecting performance measures for monitoring programs that evaluate project effectiveness. This selection process in turn improves model development and calibration for forecasting mangrove response to restoration alternatives. Hydrologic performance measures include soil regulators, particularly soil salinity, surface topography of mangrove landscape, and hydroperiod, including both the frequency and duration of flooding. Estuarine performance measures should include salinity of the bay, tidal amplitude, and conditions of fresh water discharge (included in the salinity value). The most important performance measures from the mangrove biogeochemistry model should include soil resources (bulk density, total nitrogen, and phosphorus) and soil accretion. Mangrove ecology performance measures should include forest dimension analysis (transects and/or plots), sapling recruitment, leaf area index, and faunal relationships. Estuarine ecology performance measures should include the habitat function of mangroves, which can be evaluated with growth rate of key species, habitat suitability analysis, isotope abundance of indicator species, and bird census. The list of performance measures can be modified according to the model output that is used to define the scientific goals during the restoration planning process that reflect specific goals of the project.

AB  - Tidal wetlands can be important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems, such as the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. As a result of the tendency of bacteria in wetland sediments to methylate mercury, the restoration of wetland habitat may cause an increase of MeHg concentrations. To balance the need for tidal wetland habitat with concerns over increased MeHg exposure, landscape-scale techniques for minimizing the production and export of MeHg from wetland sediments are needed. One potential approach is to use an iron sediment amendment to reduce net MeHg production. The addition of Fe[II] decreases MeHg production by lowering the concentration of the inorganic Hg[II] species that are methylated by bacteria. In this research, the potential for reducing MeHg production and export via an iron amendment was evaluated in laboratory microcosm experiments and a field study in a tidal salt marsh in the San Francisco Bay estuary. Additionally, sediment incubation experiments were conducted in anaerobic containers and in in situ cores to evaluate the effect of iron and sulfur redox cycling on MeHg production. Two laboratory microcosm experiments (Chapter 2) were conducted to test the iron amendment hypothesis under simulated tidal wetland conditions: one with devegetated sediments and one with live wetland vegetation. The microcosms consisted of intact sediment cores collected from Gambinini Marsh, a tidal salt marsh in the San Francisco Bay estuary dominated by pickleweed ( Sarcocornia pacifica). The microcosms were maintained under simulated tidal conditions and amended at four iron doses (0, 180, 360, and 720 g-Fe/m 2). Following iron addition to the devegetated sediments, porewater S[-II] concentrations decreased for each dose relative to the control. The average weekly export of MeHg in the surface water decreased by 82% and 89% for the two highest iron doses, respectively. Despite substantial variability within treatment groups, similar trends were observed in the vegetated microcosms. The results suggest that iron addition has the potential to provide a landscape-scale control on MeHg export from restored tidal wetlands under certain conditions. The cycling of iron, sulfur, and mercury in tidal wetlands is a complex process, with the combination of daily tides, changes in the growth state of wetland plants, and a highly productive microbial community resulting in temporal and spatial variations in MeHg production and export. Sediment incubation experiments (Chapter 3) were used to evaluate the effect of these processes on MeHg concentrations in the sediments of Gambinini Marsh. Sediments were incubated for 7-days in sealed jars under the following conditions: untreated sediments, addition of sodium molybdate to suppress sulfate reduction, and the addition of formaldehyde as an abiotic control. Similar rates of Fe[II] production were observed in both the untreated and Mo-amended incubations, suggesting that both iron-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria co-existed in the same sediment layers. Additionally, MeHg production was not observed when sulfate reduction was suppressed, suggesting that mercury methylation was mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria. The in situ incubations, which were conducted with open and closed cores, demonstrated that during the summer months when plants were active, separation of sediments from live plant roots and gas exchange with the atmosphere resulted in more reduced sediment conditions. Additionally, sediments at the surficial layers (0-1 cm and 3-4 cm depths) exhibited more reducing conditions during the winter than in the summer, suggesting that the oxidation of reduced iron species occurs more rapidly during the summer. To better understand the effect of iron amendments on in situ tidal marsh biogeochemistry, a 17-month field study was conducted in the Gambinini Marsh (Chapter 4). Before and after amending the sediments with 77 g-Fe/m2, porewater from pickleweed-dominated sediments in the high marsh plain were analyzed for iron, sulfur, organic carbon, nd methylmerc ry. Sulfide was not detected in the sediment porewater, and the iron amendment had no observable effect on net MeHg production. However, porewater iron concentrations were elevated for at least 6 weeks following the amendment. Porewater concentrations of MeHg and dissolved organic carbon were lower throughout 2010 than during the summer of 2009 when the experiment was initiated. However, these concentrations increased during the period of pickleweed flowering in 2010, further demonstrating the strong effect that wetland vegetation can have on sediment biogeochemical processes. This research demonstrated that an iron sediment amendment has the potential to be an effective control of MeHg production and export in tidal wetland sediments under certain conditions. While the in situ amendment showed no effect in the high marsh plain of Gambinini Marsh, the microcosm experiments demonstrated that a strong effect may be possible in sulfide-rich sediments. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the iron amendment in sulfide-rich field sediments, such as those found in low marsh environments.

AB  - In the California Coast Ranges east of San Francisco, post-3.5 Ma folding and erosion of the Mount Diablo anticline have created unusual three-dimensional exposures of late Mesozoic-Cenozoic stratigraphic and structural relations among rocks of the Franciscan subduction complex, Coast Range ophiolite, and Great Valley forearc basin. These relations offer new insights into the kinematics of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary synsubduction extension, attenuation, and blueschist exhumation within the ancestral California forearc region. Map relations and subsurface data reveal that marine strata of the Great Valley forearc basin northeast of Mount Diablo accumulated in an 100-km-long, north-south-trending, extensional graben system. Normal faults in the graben system cut steeply downsection through Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary growth strata and terminate against the Clayton-Marsh Creek fault, which is at a low angle to bedding and is interpreted to be the basal detachment for part of the graben system. The Clayton-Marsh Creek fault in turn is linked to a system of faults that juxtapose blueschist facies rocks of the underlying ancestral Franciscan accretionary prism against attenuated remnants of forearc crust that were never deeply buried, including the Coast Range ophiolite and basal Great Valley strata. These faults are the local expression of the Coast Range fault in this area. Franciscan rocks exposed beneath the faults were metamorphosed at 20 km depths after 108 Ma, based on jadeitic pyroxene and 108 Ma detrital zircons (U-Pb) in metagraywackes. Apatite fission-track data indicate that these blueschist facies rocks were subsequently uplifted and exhumed from 9 km to 3 km depths in latest Cretaceous-early Tertiary time, coeval with the subsidence and extension in the structurally overlying forearc graben system. Much of their earlier rise from 20 km to 9 km depth presumably also occurred coeval with graben development, although our data cannot determine this directly. These relations demonstrate that the California forearc around Mount Diablo was in an extensional regime undergoing active sedimentation during major Franciscan exhumation, and thus support models for exhumation of Franciscan blueschist facies rocks via synsubduction extensional processes, rather than via erosional processes.

AB  - In this paper the reliability analysis of sea flood defence systems and the probabilistic approach of the design of the sea flood defences are outlined, The application of probabilistic design methods offers the designer a way to unify the design of engineering structures, processes and management systems. For this reason there is a growing interest in the use of these methods in the design and safety analysis of civil engineering system including coastal flood defences. In this paper these methods are critical reviewed, The so-call probabilistic safety assessment and reliability based design models are developed and applied to a coastal flood defence system in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. Au accurate safety assessment of the existing coastal defence system and a set of reliability based solution are, therefore, of large importance for rehabilitating coastal flood defences of the considered case study area. In accordance with present situation and analysis results, the coastal flood defences in Nam Dinh is not strong enough to withstand the actual sea boundary condition and ensure the safety for protected areas in views of present socio-economic development. As part of knowledge transfers, the analysis results could contribute to fundamental base for long-term: planning rehabilitation of the sea defences in Vietnam. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.

Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated the flood risks faced by exposed coastal areas. These risks will increase due to climate change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of coastal disaster risk reduction DRR strategies and prevention, mitigation and preparedness PMP measures. To this end, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction formulated the Hyogo Framework for Action, and the EU has issued the Floods Directive. By their nature, neither is specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks, particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping, the non-...

AB  - The total root strength of two plant species (Spartina anglica and Limonium vulgare) is related to salt marsh cliff erosion in the Krabbenkreek (Oosterschelde). A ranking order in cliff stability is predicted on the basis of these root strength calculations. It turns out that the S. anglica root system is more effective in reducing lateral cliff erosion than the root system of L. vulgare. Also the establishment of S. anglica by germination of seeds is studied in relation to the erosion/ deposition rates at an accretion site in the Krabbenkreek. The percentage of seeds washed away depends on the mobility of the superficial sediment which increases with decreasing height above N.A.P. (Dutch Ordnance Level). Above 0.90 m + N.A.P. a germination of 20% is measured, but seedlings survive the winter period only in the zone where a patchy vegetation already exists. It is concluded that generative spread of S. anglica in the Krabbenkreek is not very likely under the present hydrodynamic conditions.

AB  - Seagrasses are declining all over the world, resulting in a substantial loss of biodiversity, coastal sediment stabilization and nursery areas of economically important fish. The seagrass decline has often been associated with increasing eutrophication of coastal areas. We tested possible toxic effects of high nitrogen concentrations in the water layer on the seagrass Zostera marina L. which is often the sole higher plant inhabiting coastal zones in the northern hemisphere. Plants grown in either mud or sand were subjected to various water ammonium and nitrate concentrations, whereby ammonium and nitrate supply were balanced (both 25 μM or 75 μM), or unbalanced (ammonium 125 μM and nitrate 25 μM, and vice versa). We used 2 temperatures, 15 and 20°C. Analyses were made after 2 and 5 wk of exposure. In an additional experiment, 9 μM ammonium and 3 μM nitrate were supplied. An ammonium concentration of 125 μM in the water layer was toxic for Z. marina: the plants became necrotic within 2 wk. After 5 wk, plants in all treatments except for the 9 μM treatment were either necrotic or had died. This suggests that toxicity occurs at ammonium concentrations as low as 25 μM. Nitrate treatment had no effect. Ammonium toxicity effects were more pronounced in plants grown on sand and at the higher temperature. It is argued that the ammonium toxicity effects on Z. marina are expected to be strongest in autumn when irradiance decreases, temperature is still high, and ambient ammonium concentrations rise.

AB  - River deltas are inhabited by over 60% of the world population, and are consequently, of paramount agricultural and economical importance. They constitute unique wetland environments which gives river deltas ecological importance as well. The high population density that characterizes these delta implies a large pressure on the natural resources resulting in a decrease in sediment supply (dam construction, irrigation works), subsidence (lowering of the groundwater table), and loss of the natural sea defence (destruction of mangroves). Global climate change may provide additional threats through accelerated sea-level rise and changing weather patterns. In South-East Asia, river floods and typhoons are expected to occur more often and as a direct result, coastal erosion and flooding will become increasingly common. Like many other Asian deltas, the delta of the Red River, in the North of Vietnam, is characterized by an alongshore alternation of irregular but rapid accretion and severe erosion. Locally, coastal erosion has been so severe (exceeding 2 km in the past decades) that entire villages have been lost to the sea; in contrast, the coastline experienced accretion up to 5 km elsewhere. The central objective of this thesis is to understand the mechanisms that regulate the medium term (time scales of decades to centuries) patterns of erosion and accretion of the Red River Delta (RRD), and in particular that of the main branch of the Red River, the Ba Lat.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability in the intertidal morphodynamic response of two macro tidal estuaries to tidal barrier construction. Contemporary bathymetric surveys of the Petitcodiac River and the Avon River in Canada were compared with historical surveys. Both rivers underwent very rapid sedimentation during construction and rapid infilling downstream of the causeway during the first year after causeway completion. At both sites, there was an unexpected decrease on the order of 90% in intertidal cross sectional area within the first 1-2 km downstream of the causeway as extensive mudflats rapidly developed. Once sufficiently consolidated, these were quickly colonized by Spartina alterniflora. The response of the remainder of the intertidal zone in the two systems has differed significantly downstream of the area of initial sedimentation. In the Petitcodiac however channel infilling continues up to 21 km downstream of the causeway. It is hypothesized that the response of the Avon system is mainly attributable to the connecting St. Croix River and associated hydrodynamics.

AB  - Globally, dykelands (former marsh areas protected by dykes) are of strategic importance for climate change adaptation. Many were originally designed to protect agricultural land, yet now protect valuable infrastructure. The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive digital atlas incorporating historical plans, shore protection, coastal geomorphology and LiDAR to serve as a basis for climate change adaptation planning in the Bay of Fundy. 110 paper plans were scanned, geo-referenced and features such as current and historical dykes, aboiteaux (tide gates), armouring, ditches, creeks, property boundaries, foreshore marsh, and geodetic elevations were digitized using ArcGIS. Attributes included age of structure, material, dimensions, and ownership. Dyke elevations were surveyed using an RTK GPS, and individual sections were identified as being vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise. Erosion rates and width of foreshore marsh were calculated per dyke segment. At present, 55% of dykes within Nova Scotia are within 0.5 m of critical elevations established in the 1960s, 2% are more than 0.5 m below critical and all are below the predicted rates of SLR by 2055. There is also a strong relationship between the placement of armouring along the dyke toe and foreshore erosion. Conversely, timely placement of armouring along the foreshore marsh decreased rates of erosion. This was most effective in areas with the largest fetch; less effective where erosion was driven by tidal currents. All data were integrated into ArcReader for use by Agriculture personnel and have been essential for cost effective climate change adaptation planning including dyke topping, hazard mitigation and education.

AB  - Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat, requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust, sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible. Innovative concepts such as 'Building with Nature' provide a basis for coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of these strategies are discussed.

AB  - Since the introduction of the term ecosystem engineering by Jones et al. many studies have focused on positive, facilitative interactions caused by ecosystem engineering. Much less emphasis has been placed on the role of ecosystem engineering in causing negative interactions between species. Here, we report on negative interactions between two well known ecosystem engineers occurring at the interface of salt marsh and intertidal flat (i.e. common cordgrass Spartina anglica and lugworms Arenicola marina), via modification of their joint habitat. A field survey indicated that, although both species share a common habitat, they rarely co-occur on small spatial scales (< 1 m). Experiments in the field and in mesocosms reveal that establishment of small Spartina plants is inhibited in Arenicola-dominated patches because of low sediment stability induced by the lugworms. In turn, Arenicola establishment in Spartina-dominated patches is limited by high silt content, compactness and dense rooting of the sediment caused by Spartina presence. Our results show that negative interactions by modification of the environment can result in rapid mutual exclusion, particularly if adverse effects of habitat modification are strong and if both species exhibit positive feedbacks. This illustrates the potential for negative interactions via the environment to affect community composition.

AB  - During the execution of the Delta project the awareness of the environmental values of estuaries was growing strongly. This awareness has led to a reconsideration of the original proposal to close off the Oosterschelde, and to an alternative view of the management of the estuarine areas and of the civil engineering structures. Now, the completed storm-surge barrier and two compartmentation dams, together with the reinforced dikes, guarantee a sufficient safety against flooding. After the decision to build a storm-surge barrier it was soon recognized that a coherent plan would be needed for the management and development of the Oosterschelde. A policy plan was accordingly produced in which the broad outlines of the policy were set out regarding the various potential uses of the estuary and the possible means of effecting them. Because of the periodic improvement and adjustment of the policy plan an environmental research programme was set up. Also, environmental research played a significant role in the decision-making processes for the completion of the barrier and the compartmentation dams as well as for the management of the storm-surge barrier. The coping-stone of the Delta Project marks the beginning of a new period in the water management of the Netherlands: the period of integrated water management. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Historically, the Loxahatchee River watershed included an area of more than 560 km(2). The drainage basin was comprised primarily of pine flatwoods interspersed with cypress sloughs, hardwood swamps, marshes, and wet prairies. Rain falling on the basin was directed through natural topography into wetlands, treated by natural biological and chemical action, and slowly released to the receiving water bodies, the Loxahatchee River and Estuary and the Indian River Lagoon. Today, approximately 434 km2 of the original watershed drain to the Atlantic Ocean through Jupiter Inlet. The watershed still includes substantial amounts of upland, freshwater wetland, riverine, and estuarine habitats, but large areas have been developed for urban and agricultural land uses. Development in the watershed, stabilization of the inlet, and dredging of the estuary and river have resulted in saltwater intrusion in the river, destruction of riverine cypress forest along the river, and upstream migration of seagrasses and mangroves. A conceptual ecological model, in the risk assessment framework, was developed for the Loxahatchee system to characterize the wetland, riverine, and estuarine components of this complex and diverse system. This model was developed as a means to build understanding and consensus among scientists and managers regarding the linkages between ecological stressors and attributes in the Loxahatchee river system. These relationships lead to development of a set of working hypotheses that explain how observed shifts in the distribution of riverine floodplain plant communities, oysters, seagrasses and other key species are related to increases in salinity in the river and estuary that have occurred during the past century in response to changing land use, climate change and water management practices. Basic and applied research is needed to address questions related to ecosystem structure and mechanisms that control the abundance and distribution of plants and animals in this system.

AB  - The Ningaloo coast of north-western Australia (eastern Indian Ocean) hosts one of the world’s longest and most extensive fringing coral reef systems, along with globally significant abundances of large marine fauna such as whale sharks. These characteristics – which have contributed to its inscription on the World Heritage list – exist because of the unique climatic, geomorphologic and oceanographic conditions. The region is hot and arid, so runoff of water from land is low, facilitating clear water that allows corals to grow close to the shore. The poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current is an important influence, bringing warm water and generally suppressing coastal upwelling. During the austral summer, strong southerly winds generate the equatorward-flowing Ningaloo Current on the inner shelf – this current facilitates sporadic upwelling events that enhance concentrations of nutrients, which in turn enhance pelagic primary productivity that supports the reef’s biota. The coast has experienced several marine heatwaves since 2011 that have caused mortality of corals and probably seagrass, albeit relatively less than elsewhere along the coast. Wind-generated surface waves break over the fringing reef crest, causing cooling currents that tend to dampen warming – although this mechanism seems not to have prevented some areas from experiencing damaging heat, and corals in places that do not receive the wave-generated currents have experienced substantial mortality. Herbivores, from fish to green turtles, are abundant, and in the lagoon, extensive stands of large brown algae provide an important habitat for newly recruited fish. There has been a decline in abundance of some fish. Predictions of future pressures include a weaker but more variable Leeuwin Current and increased human use. The ability of Ningaloo’s ecosystems to withstand growing pressures will depend partly on the rate and magnitude of global warming but also on actions that manage local pressures from increasing human use. These actions will rely on continued science to provide the evidence needed to identify the pressures, the changes they create and the ways that we can mitigate them. © S. J. Hawkins, A. L.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the application of submerged rubble mound breakwaters as coastal defence structures. As their defensive ability highly depends on the amount of wave energy remaining at their lee side, the accurate prediction of the energy in the lee of such structures is of utmost importance. Past experiments have shown that the behaviour of rough permeable rubble mound structures under oblique wave attack was found to be significantly different from that of smooth impermeable low crested structures. This behavioural difference has led to the research objective of this present study which is to investigate oblique wave transmission by rough impermeable rubble mound submerged breakwaters using 3D physical model tests. This study intentionally uncouples two parameters, being the permeability of the core and the roughness of the breakwater. Analysing the data of this study shows that the permeability of the core has no visible influence on the structure's behaviour with respect to the influence of oblique wave attack. The fully permeable rough rubble mound breakwater behaves analogous to the fully impermeable rough rubble mound breakwater.

AB  - Global environmental change, such as ocean warming and increased cyclone activity, is driving widespread and rapid declines in the abundance of key ecosystem engineers, reef-building corals, on the Great Barrier Reef. Our ability to understand how coral associated species, such as reef fishes, respond to coral loss can be impeded by uncertainty surrounding natural spatio-temporal variability of coral populations. To address this issue, we developed a semi-parametric hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate long-term trajectories of habitat-forming coral cover as a function of three spatial scales (sub-region, habitat and site) and environmental disturbances. The relationships between coral cover trajectories and fish community structure were examined using posterior predictive distributions of estimated coral cover from the statistical model. In the absence of direct observations of fish community structure, we used the probability of coral cover being above some ecological threshold values as a proxy for potential disruptions of fish community structure. Threshold values were derived from published field studies that estimated changes in the structure of coral-reef fish communities and coral cover after major disturbances. In these studies, fish community structure did not change where post-disturbance coral cover was > 20%. Disruptions in the structure of these communities were observed when coral cover dropped to between 10–20% and declines in fish diversity were typical where coral cover ranged from between 5 and 10%. Based on these thresholds values, posterior probabilities of coral cover being above 20% and between 10 and 20% and between 5 and 10% were calculated across spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from 1995 to 2011. At the GBR scale, probabilities of coral cover being above these thresholds remained relatively stable through time. Across years, probabilities of coral cover being at least > 20% remained null for the sub-regions of Cairns, Townsville, Whitsundays and Swain but highly variable between reef sites within these sub-regions, with the exception of Townsville. In the Townsville area, probabilities of coral cover being between 10–20% and 5–10% declined from 0.75 to 0 during the study period. This finding highlights potential sub-regional fish community structure disruptions which have not yet been observed at this spatial scale. As frequency and intensity of disturbance events continue to rise, and consequently, as coral cover declines further, the probabilistic Bayesian approach presented in this chapter could be used to help provide early warnings of major ecological shifts at management relevant scales in the absence of direct observations. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper details the methodology which is used to perform a flood risk analysis for the Belgian coast. The coastal flood risk analysis aims at estimating the expected value of yearly consequences by coastal flooding for a given time horizon. To calculate the risk all sources of uncertainty are accounted for by using a pragmatic probabilistic method. To calculate the flood consequences for a given extreme storm surge, a chain of process models is used that describe the wave propagation towards the coast, the failure behaviour of the coastal defences, the flooding of the coastal plain and the resulting consequences (economic damage and human casualties). © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - If a coastal dike has a crest width of more than say a few meters, then wave overtopping will be significantly reduced due to the crest width, because kinetic energy can be dissipated on the crest and water on the crest can flow back towards the seaside. In coastal towns built on dune belts often a wide-crested coastal dike was constructed as both coastal protection and sea promenade. However, quantifying the effect of such a wide crest on wave overtopping is not straightforward because no empirical overtopping formulas are given in literature for this kind of configuration. Therefore physical scale model research was carried out. Also a simplified theoretical model concept was used based on an energy balance formulation of a single overtopping wave. Combining the scale model measurements with the theoretical model, a semi-empirical formula was developed and calibrated.

AB  - This paper discusses a new type of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) named Sea wave Slot-Cone Generator (SSG). The SSG is a WEC of the overtopping type. The structure consists of a number of reservoirs one on the top of each others above the mean water level in which the water of incoming waves is stored temporary. Using this method practically all waves, regardless of size and speed are captured for energy production. In each reservoir, expressively designed low head hydro-turbines are converting the potential energy of the stored water into electrical power. A key to success for the SSG will be low cost of the structure. The wave forces on the main structure can be estimated using experiences from coastal protection structures, but the differences between the structures are so large that more reliable knowledge on the wave forces is desired. The purpose of the work is to derive information on wave loadings acting on sloping walls constituting the structure. The research is intended to be of direct use to engineers analyzing design and stability of this peculiar kind of coastal structure. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

AB  - Considering the wider context of opportunities and efforts related to a growing marine energy conversion sector, this study presents work aimed to enhance the understanding of wave resource characterisation for high and medium energy sites in Scottish waters. Results obtained through numerous field data campaigns over a 7 year period in the north of Scotland are shown, including ADCP deployments in shallow water at one of the UK’s most energetic prospective wave power sites off the Isle of Lewis, but also use of wave measurement buoys in intermediate and deep water within the same area. To investigate opportunities for wave power developments in more sheltered sites, analysis is presented for an area in the Inner Hebrides, east of the island of Colonsay. An overview of additional data campaigns in and around Orkney and the Outer Hebrides is also contained in this study, and this includes the use of X-band radar for wave and current characterisation, with initial results showing promising opportunities for further work and analysis. Due to the complex nature of developing cost-effective and reliable wave energy conversion technologies, the WEC developer’s focus is generally on device specific design engineering, based on generic assumptions in relation to the wave resource. Where this might be an appropriate approach with view to survivability and general performance, this study suggests that careful consideration must also be given to site specific resource characteristics, with particular view to exploitation of localised energy hotspots, seasonal variability, and installation and operational challenges from an early technology and project design stage. Only by carefully matching WEC technology against site and project specific resource data in a holistic approach, will it be possible to secure investor confidence, which is paramount to the development and funding of future medium and large scale wave energy installations in Scotland and beyond.

AB  - Beachrocks are hard coastal sedimentary formations consisting of various beach sediments, lithified through the precipitation of carbonate cements. The objectives of this contribution are to (a) collate and review information on the reported occurrences, characteristics and formation mechanisms of beachrocks and (b) consider their impacts on the coastal zone. The analysis of the available information has shown that (a) beachrock formation is a global and diachronic phenomenon and (b) the great majority of beachrocks are found in tropical/subtropical and low temperate latitude, microtidal coasts. The cementing agents of beachrocks are composed predominantly of the metastable carbonate phases High Magnesian Calcite (HMC) and Aragonite (Ar), appearing in a diverse crystalline morphology. It has been suggested that cement precipitation in the coastal environment is controlled by: (i) the physicochemical conditions; (ii) the presence of organic compounds and microbes; (iii) the magnitude and distribution of the wave energy along the coast; and (iv) the textural characteristics of the constituent sediments. Various theories have been proposed to explain beachrock formation itself, linking the phenomenon to either physicochemical or biological processes. These theories, however, do not seem to be of universal validity and acceptance, as each is able to explain only some of the reported occurrences. The presence of beachrocks appears to affect beach morphodynamics by: (i) 'locking' the beach profile; (ii) modifying the nearshore hydrodynamics; (iii) changing the porous character of the beach and, thus, its response to wave forcing; and (iv) differential bed erosion at the margins of the beachrock outcrops that can alter significantly the long- and, particularly, the cross-shore sediment transport. Therefore, although relict submerged beachrock outcrops may provide some coastal protection by reducing the wave energy impinging onto the coastline, modern beachrocks may promote offshore loss of unconsolidated beach sediments and buried beachrock outcropping. Finally, the presence of beachrocks may have also significant ecological impacts, as the indigenous (mobile substrate) fauna and flora of the beach is replaced by hard substrate benthic assemblages, which are commonly arranged in hydrodynamically-controlled zones.

AB  - Hydrodynamic conditions in the Oosterschelde have changed as a result of the Delta Project. Engineering works were carried out between 1960 and 1970 in the northern branch of the Oosterschelde. The Grevelingen dam was built in 1964 and the Volkerak dam was completed in the spring of 1969. With the completion of these dams, the northern branch of the Oosterschelde was cut off from other estuaries, and river flow was then regulated by a sluice complex in the Volkerak dam. Between 1980 and 1987 a storm-surge barrier was constructed across the mouth of the Oosterschelde, and two compart-mentalisation dams were built in the eastern part of the basin. The storm surge barrier decreased the effective cross-sectional area at the mouth from 80 000 m2 to 17 900 m2. The compartmentalisation dams reduce the surface area of the Oosterschelde basin from 452 km2 to 351 km2. The hydraulic impact of the works is demonstrated with data from field measurements and data from model calculations.

AB  - Estuary of the River Jagir is a gathering place of various pollutants from human activity in Surabaya. To reduce the various pollutants in the area, it can use phytoremediation technique with mangrove ecosystem. Nowadays, many mangroves can be utilized as phytoremediation agents; however its utilization is still limited on the tree-type which needs a long time to grow. In using mangroves for phytoremediation agents, Acanthus ilicifolius that thrives in the estuary of the River Jagir can be utilized. It is thrived in the Jagir River estuary and known as herbaceous plants which its growth process does not require a long time. This study aimed to analyze potency of A. ilicifolius plant as phytoremediation agents for Cu. Applications of AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric) was used in this study. The results at the study site revealed Cu in water at station 1 of <0.004 mg L-1, meanwhile at station 2 and station 3 was 0.05 mg L-1. Cu in sediments has an average of 44.73 mg L-1; in roots has an average of 20.68 mg L-1; in stem has an average of 8.51 mg L-1; and in leaves has an average of 5.75 mg L-1. Results showed that A. ilicifolius can be used as phytoremediation agent for Cu and it has the best potential at the root within a fitostabilization mechanism. As for the conservation of A. ilicifolius, can be used “in situ” and “ex-situ” cultivation. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.

AB  - Living shorelines are considered a more natural approach to shoreline stabilization for low-energy coastlines in contrast to traditional “hard” shoreline armoring methods (i.e. bulkheads). Living shorelines often vary by design and materials, which are optimized for site-specific coastal and environmental conditions, such as wave climate, tidal range, sunlight exposure, etc.; however, the core benefits of all engineered living shorelines are typically the same: reduce shoreline erosion; enhance marine, intertidal, or backshore habitat; and increase resiliency to storm surge and/or sea level rise. While the general benefits of living shorelines are well known, project-specific technical data (i.e. percent of wave energy attenuation, shoreline advancement rates) documenting the effectiveness of living shorelines is more sparse. Moreover, monitoring equipment and analysis techniques required to capture the fine-detailed technical data can prove to be cost and/or labor intensive.

AB  - Coastal salt-marshes represent an important coastal wetland system. The total area of coastal wetlands exceeds 5000 km2 in Jiangsu Province, China, but it is decreasing rapidly in response to the intense reclamation activities and coastal erosion along a part of the coastline. Hence, two types of plants,Spartina angelica andSpartina alterniflora, were introduced successively into the Jiangsu coastal areas, in order to protect the coastline from erosion and to increase the accumulation rate. Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses were carried out for sediment samples from the salt-marshes of Wanggang to determine the sedimentation rate, on the basis of an evaluation of the background activity values and the factors affecting the enrichment of Pb-210. Analysis of a typical sediment column of the tidal flat shows that there is weak absorption of Pb-210 in the silt-dominated sediment. Because of the influences of factors such as storm events, bioturbation, material sources and analytical error, some abnormal data points appear in the Pb-210 record. After ignoring these data the calculated sedimentation rate was 3.3 cm yr−1 on average. Based upon analysis of the Cs-137 dating, the rate since 1963 was 3.1 cm yr−1 on average, similar to the data by Pb-210 dating and the previous studies. The dating results show that there were three stages of sedimentation, with the most rapid accretion being taking place afterSpartina angelica was introduced into the area. The study also shows that at the stage ofSpartina alterniflora growth, the accretion rate was higher than on the flat surface with the same elevation without the cover of this plant.

AB  - Wetlands area change and ecosystem service value change for sea level rise are evaluated by using sea level affecting marshes model(SLAMM). The area of Hillsborough County, Florida was taken as the case study, where the sea level is assumed to rise 1 meter from 2010 to 2100. Five affecting processes of inundation, erosion, overwash, saturation, accretion are included in the assessment model. The results show: (1) Dry lands area will decrease by 30.37 km2, while wetlands area will increase by 30.37 km2. Estuarine open water, beaches, salt marshes, regularly flooded marsh will increase by 394.29%, 380.62%, 141.93%, 121.41% respectively. Irregularly flooded marsh, tidal fresh marsh, tidal flats, estuarine beaches, inland shore will decrease by 95.52%, 91.31%, 59.29%, 37.59%, 21.44% respectively. Mangroves, inland open water, swamp, inland fresh marsh, cypress swamp will be less affected, which will decrease by 6.67%, 4.05%, 2.35%, 0.90%, 0.10% respectively. (2) Although the total wetlands area will be increased, but the ecosystem services value will be reduced due to the loss of beach and freshwater wetlands, which will decrease from 616, 720, 000 in 2010 to 615, 480, 000 in 2100. The values of art and entertainment, water regulation, climate regulation, spiritual and cultural will be reduced, while values of water supply, habitat protection, disturbance regulation and waste disposal will enhanced. ©, 2015, Science Press.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as salt marshes and mangroves provide a promising solution to future sea level rise and increased storminess. The growing interests in understanding and modeling of wave-current interaction with coastal wetlands have increased recently for Natural-based costal protection. The SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model has achieved good simulating results on vegetation-induced wave dissipation in the condition of pure waves, while the effects of the tidal currents are ignored. A revised formula based on Hu Suzuki, Zitman, Uittewaal and Stive (2014) formulation, in which the influences of currents and an empirical relationship of Re-CD are involved, is implemented into the full spectrum model SWAN. Results show the optimized numerical model has the ability to calculate wave damping due to plants in the condition of the pure waves or the combined of waves and currents. The numerical model can provide a better tool to assess the valuable protection services provided by coastal wetlands.

AB  - Longshore sediment transport in the surf zone plays a considerable role in the long-term morphological behaviour of the Belgian coast. In order to be able to analyse coastal protection measures in the future, a 2D morphology model is developed within the Delft3D software suit using a curvilinear grid which follows the coastline closely. A schematised tide and wave climate is used as boundary conditions for the model. In addition, a constant morphological acceleration factor (MorFac) and the MorMerge online-parallel approach are employed to achieve modelling of the long-term morphology within reasonable computation time. Qualitatively, most major morphological changes are well captured by the model. The modelled sedimentation/erosion is further quantitatively compared with beach erosion/deposition trends of the last 25 years presented in Houthuys (2012). The model still shows a reasonableagreement and its quality is discussed.

AB  - The Chinese coastline stretches more than 30,000 km. Coastal erosion occurs mainly in abandoned delta fronts and some regions of modern deltas, such as in Paleo-Luanhe delta, the north part of Huanghe delta, the abandoned Huanghe delta, and the Nandujiang delta. There is also erosion in accumulative shore-terraces and sand barriers. The shift of sedimentation is focussed in the estuary, and the decrease of sediments from drainage and the change of estuarine dynamics are important conditions for the erosion in abandoned and modern deltas. Coastal erosion in China still continues. With the exploitation and construction along the coastal zones, it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention of coastal erosion in the future.

AB  - We studied the impacts of anthropogenic changes in land use on the stoichiometric imbalance of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in <i>Phragmites australis</i> wetlands in the Minjiang River estuary. We compared five areas with different land uses: <i>P. australis</i> wetland (control), grassland, a mudskipper breeding flat, pond aquaculture and rice cropland. Human activity has affected the elemental and stoichiometric compositions of soils through changes in land use. In general, soil C and N concentrations were lower and total soil K concentrations were higher at the sites under human land uses relative to the control site, and total soil P concentrations were generally not significantly different. The close relationship between total soil C and N concentrations in all cases, including fertilization with N, suggested that N was the most limiting nutrient in these wetlands. Lower soil N concentrations and similar soil P concentrations and higher soil K concentrations under human land-use activities suggest that human activity has increased the role of N limitation in these wetlands. Only grassland use increases soil N contents (only in the 0-10 cm of soil). Despite N fertilization, lower soil N concentrations were also observed in the rice cropland, indicating the difficulty of avoiding N limitation in these wetlands. The observed lower soil N:P ratio, together with higher soil P and K availabilities in rice croplands, is consistent with the tendency of human activity to change the competitive relationships of plants, in this case favoring species adapted to high rates of growth (low N:P ratio) and/or favoring plants with high demands for P and K. Both, soil C storage and respiration were higher in grasslands, likely due to the introduction of grasses, which led to a high density of plants, increased grazing activity and soil compaction. Soil C storage and respiration were lower under human land uses, except in the rice cropland, with respect to natural wetland. Using overall data, soil C storage and respiration were correlated, indicating that soil respiration was correlated with plant productivity. In this wetland area the impacts of different human land-uses on soil stoichiometry and C-cycle can be very different depending on the activity. Further regeneration of natural communities can be determined by the previous type of land-use.

AB  - ABSTRACT Wang, Y.; Shu, Z.; Zheng, Y., and Xiao, S., 2015. Plant root reinforcement effect for coastal slope stability. As an advanced engineering technology, root reinforcement has been practically applied in the coastal slope protection, but the theoretical study has lagged behind. Based on the geotechnical engineering slope theory and plant ecology, it is still needed to apply new root-soil interaction and mechanical models to provide approaches for the numerical analysis on slope stability. As the plant roots growth is complicated and changes with the coastal rock and soil, it is important to use accurate methods to assess root strengthen ability. According to the slope protection action mechanism of the vegetation and the stress-strain pattern analysis, the model of reinforcement mechanism is established to deduce the general mathematical equation of the root systematic resist-slipping stress to provide a theoretical basis for coastal slope protection design.

AB  - The export of sediments from coastal catchments can have detrimental impacts on estuaries and near shore reef ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef. Catchment management approaches aimed at reducing sediment loads require monitoring to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing loads over time. However, load estimation is not a trivial task due to the complex behaviour of constituents in natural streams, the variability of water flows and often a limited amount of data. Regression is commonly used for load estimation and provides a fundamental tool for trend estimation by standardising the other time specific covariates such as flow. This study investigates whether load estimates and resultant power to detect trends can be enhanced by (i) modelling the error structure so that temporal correlation can be better quantified, (ii) making use of predictive variables, and (iii) by identifying an efficient and feasible sampling strategy that may be used to reduce sampling error. To achieve this, we propose a new regression model that includes an innovative compounding errors model structure and uses two additional predictive variables (average discounted flow and turbidity). By combining this modelling approach with a new, regularly optimised, sampling strategy, which adds uniformity to the event sampling strategy, the predictive power was increased to 90%. Using the enhanced regression model proposed here, it was possible to detect a trend of 20% over 20 years. This result is in stark contrast to previous conclusions presented in the literature.

AB  - This presentation and paper describes the capacity of natural and nature-based features (NNBF) to reduce coastal storm hazards. Through a synthesis of existing literature and studies, as well as meta-analysis and traditional data analysis where possible, the salient characteristics and capabilities of NNBF at reducing storm surge, wave action, and erosion are characterized. The research specifically focuses on the capacity of aquatic vegetation, oyster and coral reefs, beaches, dunes, maritime forests, and barrier islands to reduce and/or mitigate these coastal hazards.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Schwedeneck-See oilfield is the first offshore exploration and production operation to be developed in German waters. Due to the close proximity to the shore of the two fixed and unmanned production platforms, there is a strong emphasis on protective and preventive measures against pollution damage to the heavily used beaches and nearshore waters. This paper reviews the important features of a sensitivity study and shoreline mapping project conducted as part of the contingency arrangements for coastal protection along 62 km of the Baltic Sea. “Sensitive areas” were identified according to coastal use, and areas of risk highlighted on the basis of oil spill trajectories. The main shore types were classified on a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of potential vulnerability to oil spill damage and anticipated difficulties for access and cleanup operations.

AB  - Wetlands and floodplains are unique landscape positions where the presence and actions of water creates unique landforms and soil properties. Land managers have a critical need for accurate maps of these landscapes for purposes such as land use planning, and restoration planning and design. In addition, there is a growing need for the development of wetland assessment models for wetland mitigation where hydrologic and biogeochemical functions are evaluated. Finally, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has embarked on a comprehensive effort to define ecological sites for the Ecological Site Description (ESD) project. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful tools for use in correlating multiple data sources to create boundaries that separate floodplains and wetlands from adjacent landscape positions. However, the challenge is to define wetlands and floodplains according to a robust system that uses the attributes available for GIS analysis. The use of the Hydrogeomoprhic (HGM) wetland classification system is presented as a superior classification system for wetland and floodplain mapping. The HGM system incorporates all wetlands and floodplains into a comprehensive system under 7 broad classes: Riverine, Depression, Mineral Flats, Organic Flats, Slope, Lacustrine Fringe, and Estuarine Fringe. These classes are defined by 3 parameters: Landscape Position, Dominant Water Source, and Hydrodynamics. This system is especially well suited for use with GIS tools because the 3 parameters can be correlated with attributes in soil, elevation, and land use and cover layers. In addition, HGM incorporates the extent of floodplains into the Riverine HGM wetland class, so there is no separation between the definition of "wetland" and "floodplain". The following GIS mapping examples using soil attributes are presented: The use of Soil Survey Geogrpahic (SSURGO) database attributes including geomorphic description, taxonomy, water features, and physical properties. In addition, examples are presented illustrating the use of elevation data to extract: watershed boundary, and Strahler Stream Order. The use of soils data alone is limited to efforts where individual soil map units can be used to delineate wetland boundaries. However, spatial analyst tools can be used to delineate wetland boundaries within soil map units. Taken together, these processes can be combined to create reasonably accurate delineations of wetland landscape positions ready for ground truthing. Successful map projects are defined as those where mapped wetland HGM class boundaries match neatly with adjacent non-wetlands, and class boundaries match neatly with adjacent transitional wetland classes. Wetlands are mapped as landscapes including the non-wetland areas which are an integral part of the system. As such, the boundaries do not define jurisdictional wetlands. For instance, the Riverine class includes non-hydric soils found on natural levees and other depositional features. Depression wetlands are mapped in a complex which include the critical upland areas between individual depressions. Slope HGM classes nearly always transition into adjacent HGM classes.

AB  - Salt marshes are key coastal ecosystems that provide habitats for wildlife, including invertebrates, fishes, and birds. They provide ecosystem services such as protection from storm surges and waves, attenuation of flooding, sequestration of pollutants (e.g., blue carbon), and nutrient removal. They are currently under great threat from sea level rise (SLR). We collected information about trends in the horizontal extent (acreage) of New Jersey salt marshes and recent elevation changes compared with the current local rate of SLR in New Jersey, which is between 5 and 6 mm year(-1). We found pervasive, although variable, rates of marsh loss that resulted from both anthropogenic disturbance as well as edge erosion and interior ponding expected from SLR. Elevation trends suggest that the current rates of SLR exceed most marsh elevation gains, although some Phragmites-dominated marshes keep pace with SLR. Four potential remedies to address current coastal trends of marsh loss were described in the context of New Jersey's regulatory and management environment: protection of marsh inland migration pathways, altered management of Phragmites, thin layer sediment placement, and living shoreline installations. Proactive steps are necessary if coastal wetland ecosystems are to be maintained over the next few decades.

AB  - The German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has an outer Baltic coastline of 354 km of which 70% is subject to erosion with an average retreat of 0.34 m/yr. Altogether 135 km of coastline is protected by wooden groynes, beach and dune nourishment, protective dunes and forests, dykes, seawalls and breakwaters at an annual maintenance cost of about 15.5 mio E. During the last decades the sea level rose at a rate of 1.2 mm/yr, and an accelerated rate of rise is likely in future. A combined coastal protection and managed re-alignment scheme was implemented in an area of about 1000 ha, which aimed to adapt to the challenges associated with climate change, to reduce costs for coastal protection and to support environmentally sustainable development. The scheme covers 6 km of coastline comprising the seaside resort Markgrafenheide and the wetland and coastal moor Hutelmoor. Researchers provide the historic background to the area, document the scheme planning and implementation process, and evaluate the approach and success of the scheme.

AB  - Coastal protection of land reclamation areas is often composed of rock or otherwise permeable material. Wave-induced setup inside permeable structures can be a problem for land reclamation areas if the design land level is too low. Wave-induced setup has not been studied extensively. In this study we use COMFLOW, a numerical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations employing the Volume-Of-Fluid method to displace the free surface, to quantify wave-induced setup inside permeable structures. The results are summarized in a conceptual design formula to determine wave-induced setup as a function of wave height Hm0 and rock diameter Dn50.

AB  - This paper describes a demonstration effort to stabilize a reservoir shoreline, Rice Reservoir, with wetland plants by use of bioengineering methods. This effort, in turn, would stabilize a jeopardized archeological site being eroded by wave action and human disturbances. Methods used to stabilize the site incorporated both emergent aquatic plants and willow species behind such measures as branchbox breakwaters and in between encapsulated soft lifts (vegetated geogrids) and into or between coir geotextile rolls. Log breakwaters were also employed to deflect wave action and encourage sedimentation. Some methods worked better than others and some failed all together.

AB  - Sea level rise is causing shoreline erosion, increased coastal flooding, and marsh vulnerability to the impact of storms. Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans. Specific climate change adaptive actions and monitoring plans are described and include shoreline stabilization, restoring marsh drainage, increasing marsh elevation, and enabling upland marsh migration. The CCAS provides a framework and methodology for successfully managing coastal systems faced with deteriorating habitat, accelerated sea level rise, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns.

AB  - Interest by land-management and regulatory agencies in using biological indicators to detect wetland degradation, coupled with ongoing use of this approach to assess water quality in streams, led to the desire to develop and evaluate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for wetlands that could be used to categorize the level of degradation. We under-took this challenge with data from coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, which have been degraded by a variety of human disturbances. We studied six barrier beach wetlands in western Lake Superior, six drowned-river-mouth wetlands along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and six open shoreline wetlands in Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Plant, fish, and invertebrate communities were sampled in each wetland. The resulting data were assessed in various forms against gradients of human disturbance to identify potential metrics that could be used in IBI development. Our results suggested that the metrics proposed as potential components of an IBI for barrier beach wetlands of Lake Superior held promise. The metrics for Lake Michigan drowned-river-mouth wetlands were inconsistent in identifying gradients of disturbance; those for Lake Huron open embayment wetlands were yet more inconsistent. Despite the potential displayed by the Lake Superior results within the year sampled, we concluded that an IBI for use in Great Lakes wetlands would not be valid unless separate scoring ranges were derived for each of several sequences of water-level histories. Variability in lake levels from year to year can produce variability in data and affect the reproducibility of data collected, primarily due to extreme changes in plant communities and the faunal habitat they provide. Substantially different results could be obtained in the same wetland in different years as a result of the response to lake-level change, with no change in the level of human disturbance. Additional problems included limited numbers of comparable sites, potential lack of undisturbed reference sites, and variable effects of different disturbance types. We also evaluated our conclusions with respect to hydrologic variability and other major natural disturbances affecting wetlands in other regions. We concluded that after segregation of wetland types by geographic, geomorphic, and hydrologic features, a functional IBI may be possible for wetlands with relatively stable hydrology. However, an IBI for wetlands with unpredictable yet recurring influences of climate-induced, long-term high water periods, droughts, or drought-related fires or weather-related catastrophic floods or high winds (hurricanes) would also require differing scales of measurement for years that differ in the length of time since the last major natural disturbance. A site-specific, detailed ecological analysis of biological indicators may indeed be of value in determining the quality or status of wetlands, but we recommend that IBI scores not be used unless the scoring ranges are calibrated for the specific hydrologic history pre-dating any sampling year.

AB  - A storm that occurred close to the spring tidal maxima in March 2013 resulted in beach lowering and cliff recession of c. 5 in along a 110 in frontage at Hopton-on-Sea, UK and threatened the static caravan park of Bourne Leisure Ltd. This paper reports a study using XBeach and MIKE21 models to assist with the design of new coastal defences to reduce cliff and beach erosion. Two schemes are examined here: three fishtail rock groynes (Scheme 1); and ten 'double-head' curved rock groynes (Scheme 2). The selected design must provide acceptable level of protection and, to be granted consent, no adverse environmental impact must be demonstrated. Current practice using a single numerical model can provide a cost-effective tool for coastal defence assessments. However, the work presented here show that when good agreement between complementary models can be demonstrated, greater confidence can be given to model results. Specifically, refinements to the present scheme design were made possible by the use of the)(Beach model, which allowed identification of the cross-shore limits of sediment transport in storm conditions, and by the MIKE21 model which allowed quantification of alongshore scheme impacts. Together, the model results have assisted the development of an improved final scheme design which minimizes potential environmental impacts.

AB  - Bypassing and backpassing both involve significant dredging operations. In backpassing, beaches are replenished by offshore dredging, usually with conventional dredgers. Bypassing is typically employed to move sand supplied by littoral drift across an estuary or harbour entrance, thus preventing excessive erosion at the updrift side and erosion in the downdrift region. Fixed dredge plant and pipelines are often proposed for bypassing. Both bypassing and backpassing generally involve hydraulic suction dredging, often from considerable depths. At these dredging depths pumps must be set well below water surface level to avoid cavitation, and the required depth increases with solids concentration. For fine sands and velocities well above the limit of deposition, pump settings can be calculated approximately by the equivalent fluid model. For other cases more sophisticated modeling is required. The example calculations given in the paper show that for sand-water flows, enlarged or sloping suction piping generally does not reduce the likelihood of pump cavitation. However, submerged feeder pumps can be useful in this regard, for example centrifugal ladder pumps on dredgers used for backpassing. For bypassing plant, either a very deep single pump or multiple feeder pumps are possibilities. It is desirable to have these feeder pumps (probably jet pumps) discharge to an open pump before the main pump. This arrangement enhances stability and can increase sand concentration, leading to improved system efficiency.

AB  - This paper presents the influence of aeolian sediment transport on the initial morphological evolution of beach and dunes at the man-made dune system ‘Hondsbossche Dunes’ at the Dutch coast. In total 35 million m^3 dredged material was used for the construction of a beach, dune and foreshore system. This study focused on differences in morphological response within the five different realized dune profile types. A conceptual framework was developed, based on the assessment of (1) environmental forcing, (2) sediment supply from aeolian and marine sources and (3) dune types. These three components were quantified from an analysis of measured profile evolution and the application of an aeolian sediment transport model for the first 19 months since the project delivery date in May 2015. Morphological changes were most pronounced in the first seven months after construction. Dune growth of a profile type at this location is determined by a temporal and alongshore variability in local processes that determines the aeolian sediment supply towards the dunes and the dune geometry that determines the capacity of the profile type to capture the sediments. The model simulations managed to qualitatively reproduce alongshore variations in dune growth as a result of spatial variations in sediment availability, grain size, profile shape and interaction with vegetation. Overall, this study shows the relevance of both marine and aeolian processes in such man-made dynamic systems that are comparable to natural systems. Continuing the monitoring and modelling of this system will improve the quantitative knowledge for design optimization of the Building with Nature philosophy.

AB  - The Halligen in the Northfrisian part of the UNESCO – World Natural Heritage Wadden Sea are exposed to extreme storm surges due to climate change and sea level rise. Existing coastal protection measures in this area do not consider the future sea state and are mainly based on tradition and expert knowledge. The presented work is part of the project ZukunftHallig (supported by the German Coastal Engineering Research Council) and has the main objective to design and evaluate new coastal protection techniques and management strategies for the Halligen. With numerical simulations hydrological parameters are investigated. Furthermore sensitivity analyses expose possible variations in future storm surges and illustrate the difference in significant wave heights for varying wind climates. This risk based approach of the project is a suitable way to ensure life for future generations on these islands under sustainable ecological und economic conditions.

AB  - The Northfrisian Halligen are small undiked marsh islands and located in the German part of the UNESCO - World Natural Heritage Wadden Sea. The houses of the inhabitants are built on dwelling mounds and during storm events these mounds are the only places which are not inundated on the islands. With respect to climate change and related changes in mean and extreme water levels, new coastal protection measures and strategies have to be developed. At the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (IWW) of the RWTH Aachen University different tools are used to evaluate and to develop new coastal protection measures and strategies for these islands. Within this project several new coastal protection measures and strategies for the Hallig islands have been developed and existing protection measures have been technically and economically evaluated. In addition, social accompanying measures were set-up to rise flood awareness and acceptance.

AB  - Floods from land runoff, principally the Burdekin River, created buoyant freshwater plumes along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. From Cape Upstart near the Burdekin River mouth, to the Innisfail 250 km north, no eviedence was found of these plumes directly reaching the Great Barrier Reef. Small buoyant patches, detached from the river plumes, found further offshore might reach the Great Barrier Reef. Classical estuarine circulation in the lagoon, even in flood conditions, and tidal flushing by the ocean do not appear to be significant compared to advective processes.

AB  - Coastal geomorphology in the Nakdong River Delta, South Korea, has been conspicuously changed in the last two decades partly by human activities and partly by natural processes. In this study, we discuss the characteristics of SAR data over coastal region and an efficient approach to detect coastal geomorphologic change in the study area. Eight data sets were collected over the study area including four SAR images. Although SAR image is very useful to detect coastal change, speckle noise in SAR image is, however, a serious problem in this application. An weighted averaging process of multiple SAR data sets in wavelet domain effectively reduces the speckle in the RADARSAT SAR fine beam mode image. The speckle reduced SAR image is then combined with optical data such as Landsat TM or MSS to evaluate the morphologic changes in the coastal region. The straight comparison of optical and SAR data is not efficient mainly because of difference in resolution. In stead of that, optical and SAR data fusion through Brovey transform enhances the geomorphologic changes in the coastal area. Through the approach, we have successfully delineate the geomorphologic changes made by natural processes and human activities over the study area. In short, the SAR data acquired in different resolution and incidence angle are very promising to monitor geomorphologic changes in coastal region when it is combined with optical remote sensing data.

AB  - We used historical flood plume extent data (modelled) to quantify the typical spatial extent of the summer runoff-seawater mixing zone of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Spatially explicit analysis of the variability of in situ chlorophyll a concentrations (observed) across the runoff-seawater mixing zone, then allowed us to explore regional differences in the nutrient enrichment impact of runoff events from the various river systems that drain the GBR catchment. We demonstrate the existence of a discernable north-south gradient along the length of the GBR, such that for equivalent runoff:seawater dilutions ratios, lower levels of nutrient enrichment (as indicated by chlorophyll a observations) result from the river systems that drain the relatively undisturbed northern areas of the GBR catchment, compared to more human-impacted central and south areas. We identify a strong correlation between this north-south enrichment gradient and the flood concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) entrained by the various river systems. By substituting the nutrient enrichment characteristics of the human-impacted river discharges with those of the undisturbed northern rivers, we provide a means to compare the short-term enriching 'footprint' for existing runoff intrusions with those that are likely to have occurred under pre-European catchment conditions. We demonstrate that under pre-European conditions, the nutrient enriching impact from river runoff was likely to have been largely constrained within 1-2 km of the coast, whereas existing conditions support the impact of reefs some 20-30 km off the coast. By using the developed spatial relations, we show that for the heavily human-impacted river systems, reductions in the end-of-river concentrations of DIN in the order 50-80% are needed in order to restore parity with pre-European conditions. We discuss these results in regard to developing end-of-catchment water quality targets for the region. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Short-term hydrodynamic predictions may not fully answer questions relating to the estuary wide consequences resulting from the implementation of a managed realignment scheme. Specifically questions such as sustainability and the loss of existing habitats are difficult to answer. A Regime application has been successfully applied to consider the long-term (decades to centuries) impacts of a potential managed realignment site within a UK estuary. As well as demonstrating the effectiveness of a Regime application to a managed realignment scheme, this work has demonstrated that the placement of such schemes can results in a significant alteration in water levels and estuary morphology which have a significant impact on existing intertidal habitats. The application of the Regime model with the various scheme placements demonstrates the need to fully understand the gains and losses attributed to the placement of managed realignments within the wider estuarine environment.

AB  - Raw sewage and industrial waste have been dumped into sensitive estuaries, bays, and sounds for centuries. The full extents of the resulting sludge deposits are largely unknown, because they move in response to tidal and long-shore currents, and because they are often buried by younger inert sediments. USGS field and laboratory measurements of toxic mine waste and organic effluent samples suggest that anthropogenic wastes typically contain finely-divided metal and metal-sulfide particles. The anoxic environment provided by anthropogenic wastes promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, creating a self-reducing environment. We suggest that the finely-divided metal and metal-sulfide particles are the products of bacterial reduction and precipitation. The fine-grained metallic precipitates are ideal targets for a surface-effect electrochemical detection methodology called Induced Polarization (IP). A USGS-patented (1998/2001) marine IP streamer technology has recently been commercialized and used to map black smoker sulfide deposits and their disseminated halos in the Bismarck Sea (2005), and titanium-sand deposits offshore of South Africa (2007). The marine induced polarization system can do this mapping in three dimensions, more rapidly (it is towed at 3 knots) , and with far higher resolution that land-based measurements or vibracoring. Laboratory-scale studies at the USGS suggest that anthropogenic wastes may display a specific multi-frequency IP spectral signature that may be applicable to waste-deposit mapping.

This study presents a comprehensive review of geological and physical aspects of sediment dynamics in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (MRDP), with special reference to diversion studies over the past two decades. We synthesize these studies, present the current understanding of sediment diversions in the context of sediment dynamics, identify multiple key knowledge gaps, and make recommendations for future studies. To maximize net land building in the MRDP, management strategies should be focused on (a) enhancing river sediment delivery (both mud and sand), (b) increasing sediment retention in receiving basins and (c) minimizing erosion in bays and estuaries. Compared with extensive studies of land building, there have been relatively fewer studies of erosional processes. A heterogeneous coastal geological framework, cohesive sediment erodibility and subsidence together play complicated yet critical roles in future sediment dynamics in bays and estuaries of the MRDP. Sediment retention rates are highly sensitive to spatial and temporal scales, types of sediments and delivery season. Sediment diversions to seaward receiving basins provide more surge protection but tend to have lower sediment retention due to active coastal processes. Structures and devices that improve sediment retention, trap sediments, dissipate waves, and build living shorelines should be explored and cost-to-benefit analysis is needed. Long-term planning should consider more landward diversions, strategic community relocation, and nonlinear response of the complex sedimentary system of the MRDP.

AB  - In order to facilitate engineering design and coastal flooding protection, the potential storm surge induced by a typhoon is studied. Using an unstructured mesh, a coupled model which combines the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and simulating waves nearshore (SWAN) model is applied to analyze the storm surge and waves on the coast of Jiangsu Province. The verifications of wind velocity, tidal levels and wave height show that this coupling model performs well to reflect the characteristics of the water levels and waves in the studied region. Results show that the effect of radiation stress on storm surge is significant, especially in shallow areas such as the coast of Jiangsu Province and the Yangtze estuary. By running the coupled model, the simulated potential flooding results can be employed in coastal engineering applications in the Jiangsu coastal area, such as storm surge warnings and extreme water level predictions.

AB  - River engineering in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system and changing land use practices in the Upper Mississippi River Basin have reduced sediment loads and modified sediment distribution to the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Concurrently, the Louisiana Gulf coast has been subject to the highest rate of relative sea-level rise of any region in the United States. This study investigated suspended sediment transport and delivery from the Atchafalaya River, a 187-km-long river-swamp system that carries about 30% of the Mississippi River's water into the Gulf of Mexico. The study modelled long-term (1975-2004) riverine sediment fluxes, assessed land area changes in the Atchafalaya Bay, and analysed the relationship between riverine sediment supply and the delta fan process. The study showed a sediment inflow of 6.4 x 10(7) tonnes year(-1) and a sediment outflow of 5.8 x 10(7) tonnes year(-1) in the Atchafalaya. Seasonally, sediment loads were highest in the spring and lowest in the late summer, corresponding to the river's hydrologic conditions. For the past 30 years, the Atchafalaya retained 9% of the inflow sediment, which is considerably lower than the double-digit percentage rates of deposition reported for the period from the 1930s to the 1960s. Satellite image analyses found rapid land accretion in the Atchafalaya Bay during the past two decades. Much of the newly created land area was quickly vegetated, stabilizing the small delta lobes against sediment resuspension.

AB  - The effect of nine Tween surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters) on methanogenesis and the microbial reductive dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was examined using three anaerobic, HCB-dechlorinating mixed cultures, one glucose fed and two lactate fed, that were derived from contaminated estuarine sediments. The two lactate-fed cultures differed significantly in their metabolic activity, especially with respect to the rate and extent of HCB reductive dechlorination. The objective of the study was to screen and select biologically compatible surfactants for use in subsequent research on surfactant-enhanced bioavailability of sorbed-phase chlorinated organic contaminants. Addition of the Tween surfactants resulted in lower rates of methanogenesis and HCB dechlorination compared with the control (i.e., surfactant-free culture) for both the glucose-fed culture and the lactate-fed culture, which exhibited a high metabolic activity. Tween-61 and -65 exhibited the lowest inhibition of HCB dechlorination at initial surfactant concentrations of 200 and 1,000 mg/L. On the other hand, the Tween surfactants, especially Tween-81 and -85, enhanced the rates of both methanogenesis and HCB dechlorination when the low metabolic activity lactate- fed culture was used. The observed rate enhancements may be attributed to bacterial cell membrane modification by the surfactants. Attempts to correlate methanogenesis rates to surfactant properties (such as the hydrophile-lipophile balance number, fatty acid carbon chain length, and the number of ethylene oxide groups) were not successful. In general, increased surfactant concentrations resulted in lower rate and extent of HCB dechlorination. Although HCB dechlorination was completely inhibited at a surfactant concentration of 1,000 mg/L, the extent of methanogenesis was not affected. Results from this study demonstrate that despite compositional similarities among the Tween surfactants, their effects on biological activities, such as methanogenesis and reductive dechlorination, can differ significantly.

AB  - Dynamic characteristics and wave attenuation mechanism of flexible vegetation is fundamental to ocean engineering and nature-based coastal defense solutions. Based on simulation results by the flexible vegetation dynamic model, relative water depth, wave height, wave period and vegetation elastic modulus have noteworthy influences on submerged flexible vegetation dynamics. Meanwhile, simulation results by the coupled XBeach + FVDM model indicate that increasing vegetation distribution density and length can result in larger wave attenuation under the present investigation conditions. The findings of this research provide insights for flexible vegetation dynamic characteristics and resulting wave attenuation mechanism.

AB  - A two-stage saltmarsh restoration approach is proposed. The eroded steep coast will be protected by lifting the seabed level in two steps, firstly slowing down the flow velocity and initially increasing the bottom elevation, and secondly establishing a tidal flat for saltmarsh development. The approach is implemented in a typical eroded coast in Hangzhou Bay and the effects of the engineering design are simulated by numerical model TELEMAC. It is shown that after the project is completed, the previous erosion state in the local area is radically altered and a tidal flat of 90m width can be restored. The effectiveness of the project is discussed.

AB  - The glaciomarine sedimentary record of the fjord head (Collins Harbor) in Maxwell Bay, South Shetland Islands (West Antarctica), a large marine calving embayment, contains repeating couplets of organic-rich massive diamicton and organic-poor stratified diamicton. The massive diamicton is characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) content and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios and was deposited in a cold climate regime by iceberg-rafted sedimentation from coastal fast ice in which algal plants, as well as gravels, were entrained. The stratified diamicton is characterized by low TOC content and C/N ratios and was formed in a warmer climate regime when the flux of icebergs was suppressed, but turbid meltwater discharge continued to produce lamination. When the meltwater discharge decreased in cold climatic conditions, and resultant phytoplankton productivity was reduced due to the increased sea-ice coverage, ice rafting from shorefast sea ice might have played a major role in entraining benthic algae, as well as loads of sand and gravel, along the coastal area, resulting in an increased C/N ratio and gravel content in the massive diamicton. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analyses conducted on well-preserved calcite shells were used to construct a chronology for the past 3000 years. Fluctuations in TOC are recorded (approximately four cycles over this time period), with the average duration of a cooling cycle being 6500 years. These cycles may be correlative with the high-frequency (550 yr) variability in reduced Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) on the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf, because a decrease in CDW may be related to reduced deep water production in the North Atlantic during colder periods, as demonstrated for glacial intervals throughout the Pleistocene.

AB  - Coastal erosion caused by sea level rise is a serious problem over the world. Future sea level rise will almost certainly accelerate through the 21st century. Although its extent remains uncertain, some predictions expect the increase to be between up to 30 and 180 cm by 2100 (Nicholls and Cazenave, 2010). Several studies show that sea level rise is responsible for long-term beach erosion. Moreover, change of wave height and non-climate-related processes such as ground subsidence amplify coastal vulnerability associated with climate change. It is a pressing issue to predict shoreline change considering the fact that 10% of the global population lives in the coastal regions within 10 m elevation. This study estimates the potential impact of climate change in terms of the effects of: sea level rise; wave height variation; and land subsidence by comparing the past coastline evolutions at five beaches in Japan. The past long-term shoreline change was found to be related to coastal protection measures according to Japan's national policy (Coast Act). Notable erosion was resulted from the construction of coastal facilities that blocked coastal sand drift and the decrease of sediment supply from rivers caused by dam building from 1950 to 1990. Since 1990, shoreline has relatively unchanged because some measures, such as beach nourishment, groins and detached breakwaters, have worked to conserve sand beaches. The estimation results showed that shoreline would retreat over 15 m due to sea level rise and up to 5 m due to wave height variation at the five beaches by 2100. Projection of ground subsidence is uncertain because its rate varies depending on natural forces and human activities. This study suggests that sea level rise would have much greater impact on beach erosion compared with wave height variation and ground subsidence.

AB  - In recent 15 years, the biodiversity of Chongming Dongtan national nature reserve has been dramatically reduced by invasive plants, especially by spartina alterniflora. How to obtain and monitor spatio-temporal change of spartina alterniflora has great practical significance in managing and protecting Chongming Dongtan. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper was to build up a method to recognize different species of salt marsh vegetation and analyze the spatio-temporal change by interpreting remote sensed data of different period. Considering the complexity of different plant' spectral feature, the feature space was consisted of Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kanth-Thomas transformation (K-T transformation) and an optimal band combination. In order to enhance classification accuracy, a dual-weight support vector machine (SVM) classification model by weighting on different features and classes was proposed. The kernel function of this model was selected as wavelet which satisfied the practical situation better. During the experiment, training and validation data were ground survey points located by GPS. The results from this study indicated that the invasion of spartina alterniflora was serious and it kept expanding to the southern. Furthermore, the method proposed in this paper could get higher detection accuracy than the traditional methods and was suitable for the small-sample experiment. Consequently, using this approach could provide timely analytical data for the time and space distribution change of the Salt Marsh Vegetation in intertidal zones, meanwhile the results will provide sound scientific basis for carrying out some proper management and control of Spartina alterniflora.

AB  - Interfacing magnetic particles with ordered mesoporous materials is an effective direction for the development of functional porous composite materials with rationally designed core-shell structures. Owing to the combined properties of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (high surface area, large pore volume, porosity, and biocompatibility), core-shell magnetic mesoporous silica materials have generated tremendous interest in various disciplines, including chemistry, materials, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Interfacial assembly strategies enable the rational construction of magnetic mesoporous silica materials with well-defined core-shell structure, morphology, pore parameters, and surface wettability, which can decisively influence their physical and chemical properties and thus improve their application performance. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis of core-shell magnetic mesoporous silica and the adjustment of key parameters, including pore size, morphology, and pore orientation.

AB  - Riparian areas are unique ecosystems and ecotones that provide many ecosystem services. Their importance is even larger in dryland areas because of the water scarcity conditions. This is especially true in the Mediterranean region where their value has been recognized and utilized for thousands of years. This utilization has led to severe their degradation, and in many cases, elimination. The Mediterranean Basin is also considered one of the most sensitive regions to climate change impacts. In this review, review, firstly the characteristics of the riparian areas of the region were identified, based on its climatic and geographic conditions but also anthropogenic impacts. Secondly, the potential impacts of climate change on riparian areas were assessed by understanding the associated effects on the hydrologic regimes of rivers. Flow patterns are expected to become flashier with greater periods of drought and peak flows with higher magnitudes. This should impact the ecological processes of riparian areas and their vegetation assemblages and exacerbate the existing pressures they already face due to the numerous and diverse anthropogenic activities in the region. Based on the current and future conditions, it is imperative that measures should be taken to protect and reestablish riparian corridors in the Mediterranean. Although many areas are protected by initiatives such as the Natura 2000 Network or the the Ramsar Convention, additional and innovative practices need to be implemented. Specifically, the adoption of ecosystem-based approaches such as nature-based solutions and soil and water bioengineering are recommended because they take into consideration the ecosystem services of riparian areas. Even when practices are implemented at a local scale, they need to adopt a watershed scale approach to understand the drivers of riparian areas and the impacts from anthropogenic activities. The key for the successful restoration of riparian areas is restoring the natural hydrologic and geomorphologic regimes. Finally, the methods utilized need to have a transdisciplinary approach that involves academics, policy makers, local experts and stakeholders.

AB  - This species profile is one of a series on coastal aquatic organisms. The profiles are designed to provide coastal managers, engineers, and biologists with a brief comprehensive sketch of the biological characteristics and environmental requirements of the species and to describe how populations of the species may be expected to react to environmental changes caused by coastal development. Each profile has sections on taxonomy, life history, ecological role, environmental requirements, and economic importance, if applicable. The reefs constructed by reef-building tube worms along the S.E. Florida coast are significant both geologically and biologically. The ability of the worms to thrive under high-energy breaker conditions and to extend their colonial tube masses upward and seaward by extraction and agglutination of littoral drift materials makes them important vectors in coastline development. Beachrock, converted from the reefs, and sand impounded on their landward sides provide for progradation of beaches. Being wave resistant, the reefs protect the shore against wave attack and retard erosion. It appears likely that these tube worms are at least in part responsible for the formation and maintenance of beaches and barrier islands in S.E. Florida. The reefs provide hard and stable substrate, shelter, and food, and thereby allow many species to inhabit the surf zone .

AB  - <jats:sec> <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Five oil refineries discharge into a narrow section of the San Francisco Bay, known as the Carquinez Strait. Previous studies have shown that these discharges increase the concentration of Se in both the water and sediments of this area, potentially threatening local bird populations. As a result of a partnership involving Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Dept. of Energy, and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, selenium cycling in wetlands is being investigated. Two sites, each downstream of a major oil refinery, were characterized with respect to selenium concentration and speciation in surface water, suspended sediment, pore water, marsh sediment, plants, and clams.</jats:p> <jats:p>Sedimentation dynamics were found to be an important factor in Se distribution, because of the high affinity of selenium on suspended sediments and the landward-decreasing energy of the depositional environment. Although more than 99% of sediment selenium is in insoluble forms, concentrations of aqueous selenium in sediment pore water were found to be an order of magnitude higher than in overlying Bay water, suggesting selenium diffusion out of the sediment. Chemical reduction of selenium in both sediments and the water column under experimentally ponded conditions was found to occur on time scales exceeding the duration of tidal flooding of, these environments. The implications of these findings bear strongly on the future approach to selenium monitoring, prompting a focus on the sediment-water interface and further research into selenium association with suspended sediment.</jats:p> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title> <jats:p>Motivated by revelations of selenium toxicity to waterfowl at Kesterson Reservoir, California, selenium (Se) became a focus of public and regulatory attention in the mid 1980's. In response to appeals from public agencies and environmental groups, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Water Board") adopted in 1986 a Basin Plan aimed at reducing the mass of selenium being deposited in San Francisco Bay. As is now known, oil refineries contribute selenium into the Bay via the effluent of the refining process (Ref. 1). Therefore, the Water Board moved to limit those discharges by issuing permits. In 1991, permits to six refineries (Shell, UNOCAL, Chevron, Exxon, Tosco, and Pacific) were issued which required limiting Se discharge at 1991 levels and set a December 1993 deadline to attain Se concentrations of 50 g/L in refinery effluent. A comprehensive review of the problem and strategy were published by the Water Board in 1992. Toward the end of 1993, it became apparent that goals set forth by the Water Board were not attainable by the set deadline. Out of this realization came a settlement between the Water Board and the refineries, as represented by the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA). The settlement provided for a $2 million mitigation fund to be used for resolving San Francisco Bay contamination issues. A small part of this find was be used to aid refineries in attaining the 50 g/L selenium standard. Most of it is earmarked for studies of the behavior and transport of Se and other contaminants in the Bay as well as wetlands restoration. As part of this settlement, Bay Area refineries have until July 1st of 1988 to comply with both concentration and loading limits.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Past Research and Unresolved Issues</jats:title> <jats:p>Se occurs naturally in certain areas of the San Joaquin Valley, generally associated with Cretaceous shales or material eroded from those formations (Ref. 2). The latter was the source of Se which eventually found its way to Kesterson Reservoir. Being that Cretaceous shales are also associated with crude oil deposits, Se is found in relatively high concentrations in San Joaquin Valley (SJV) crude. Therefore, refineries which use SJV crude discharge effluent which is higher in Se than those which use crude from other ar as, such as Alaska's North Slope. Se concentrations in effluent from the SJV crude refining process at Shell, UNOCAL, and Exxon refineries fall in the range of 400 to 700 g/L, exceeding the Water Board standard by one order of magnitude. Conversely, the Chevron refinery uses low-selenium crude, resulting in an effluent Se concentration of approximately 25 g/L.</jats:p> <jats:p>P. 63</jats:p> </jats:sec> </jats:sec>

AB  - San Andres Island (SW Caribbean, Colombia), an uplifted oceanic atoll of Miocene origin, consists of a well-developed coral and carbonate bank-barrier reef complex. From a former cotton and coconut economy in 1953, it became a major trade and tourist center currently having a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants in a land area of just 25 km2. Human activities directly affecting the marine environment have included dredge and fill operations, shipwrecks and groundings, disposal of urban waste, thermal pollution, over-fishing, construction along the shoreline, and diving, boating and beach-going activities. From qualitative observations carried out from 1968 to 1979, and quali- and quantitative resurveys made in 1992 to 1996, major biotic changes became evident in the upper insular platform (0-25 m in depth). These were: a detectable decline in live coral cover (to an overall mean of 30% of hard substrata in 1992), extensive recent coral mortality (overall mean in 1992 of 52% of total live + dead coral cover), almost total disappearance of the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum and the sea-fan Gorgonia ventalina, proliferation of algae (to about 60-70% cover of the overall reef hard substrata in 1992), and an almost total absence of commercial reef organisms, including both carnivores and herbivores. With exceptions due to localized solid and sewage disposal, coastal construction and ship groundings, coral death followed a spatial pattern of increased values in lagoonal, enclosed environments and lower values in high energy zones and in deep reef areas. The higher coral death in shallow lagoonal areas was interpreted as being directly caused by a greater susceptibility of coral species making up the shallow reef frameworks (i.e., Acropora, Porites) to hurricane and storm damage and to diseases. Indirectly, it may have been caused by the effect of the prevalent regime in lagoonal areas of higher illumination (allowing greater algal growth after the die-off of Diadema), low turbulence and limited water flushing (causing higher susceptibility to bleaching and diseases, and lower rates of natural and artificial lesion regeneration), and by a higher incidence of lethal or chronic effects of anthropogenic activities. San Andres constitutes a typical example of the widespread phenomenon of over-development and poor planning of small islands. Its growing recreational tourism, which is based mostly on attractive and 'healthy' seascapes, will soon be seriously threatened.

AB  - This paper documents the role of salt marsh algal mats in the productivity of a southern California tidal wetland. The productivity of the mats, which are composed of filamentous bluegreen and green algae and diatoms, varies both temporally and spatially in relation to tidal inundation and overstory vegetation. The estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) were highest under the canopy of Jaumea carnosa (Less.) Gray (341 g C m-2 yr-1) at low elevation. Elsewhere, NPP appeared to be limited by low light (276 g C m-2 yr-1 under Spartina foliosa Trin.) and desiccation (185 g C m-2 yr-1 under Batis martima L. and 253 g C m-2 yr-1 under Monanthochloe littoralis Engelm). Algal NPP was from 0.8 to 1.4 times that of the vascular plant overstory NPP. It is hypothesized that the arid environment of southern California and resulting hypersaline soils reduce vascular plant cover, which leads to high algal productivity. © 1980 Estuarine Research Federation.

AB  - Salt marshes (also spelled saltmarshes) occur where fine sediments accumulate along sheltered shorelines of marine bays, saline lakes, and alkali sinks. Those in intertidal settings are well studied for two reasons (1) salinity reduces plant diversity and inundation/exposure regimes structure composition, facilitating manipulative studies of vegetation-elevation patterns and (2) large expanses of monotypic vegetation are amenable to analysis of ecosystem functions (productivity, nutrient dynamics, food web support, and landscape connectivity). Salt marshes continue to advance science in these areas. Several functions of salt marsh ecosystems are considered services of high value to society, for example, primary productivity, denitrification, and biodiversity support. In urban and agricultural areas, especially bays with major ports, up to 100% of salt marsh area has been destroyed or converted to human uses (e.g., salt ponds, fish ponds, diked and desalted lands for agriculture). Pollution, canals, subsidence, and increasing rates of sea-level rise (with global warming) continue to threaten salt marsh quantity and quality. Restoration efforts are underway in part to manage the retreat anticipated with rising sea level and to replace lost wetlands. Several innovative experiments in salt marshes are advancing both restoration practice and science. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of altered tidal circulation on southern California salt marshes are investigated by comparing a well-flushed wetland and two modified wetlands which have reduced tidal flow. The Tijuana Estuary had continuous exchange of seawater but relatively low net aerial primary productivity (0.4-1.0 kg m-2yr-1) of vascular plants. Low productivity (0.6 kg m-2yr-1) was also found in the Flood Control Channel of the San Diego River, where tidal exchange was restricted to flow through a riprap dike. High productivity (1.2-2.9 kg m-2yr-1) in Los Penasquitos Lagoon was attributed to the influences of freshwater impounded behind a sand bar which blocked the mouth of the lagoon during much of the study period. It is hypothesized that elimination of tidal flow during the growing season increased primary productivity of vascular plants because freshwater runoff decreased soil salinity and because nutrients were retained within the marsh. However, we predict that sand bar obstruction can decrease productivity if below-average rainfall leads to hypersalinity of closed lagoons. Comprehensive evaluation of the effects of altered tidal circulation requires longterm study and examination of the total ecosystem. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - ABSTRACT In September 1998, during Hurricane Georges, 5,000–10,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil were released from a refinery, oiling freshwater marshes along Lajas Creek near Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Aggressive cleanup actions were taken to protect downstream areas including placement of fill material to access the marsh, limited mechanical scraping and excavation of vegetation and sediments, cutting of oiled vegetation, and dragging of sorbents across the marsh by hand. It was thought at the time that oil would not penetrate the marsh sediments and that the vegetation would recover within 3 months. During irregular site visits from October 1998 through July 2000, the authors checked for the presence/absence of subsurface oiling and made simple field observations of vegetation establishment. Fresh black oil was found in creek levee sediments down to the water table, as deep as 60 cm. The oil penetrated the sediments through root channels, animal burrows, and perhaps desiccation cracks in the clay soils. In wetter, nonlevee sediments, oil was mixed into the substrate, possibly by foot depressions, to 15 cm below the surface. A buried layer of fresh oil also was found under fill material. Penetration of oil into marsh sediments likely was related to the type of marsh and geomorphic features present at the site. In January 1999, revegetation from seed was underway in some areas, although the visual appearance of plant cover and height was less than that observed in nonoiled areas and several large areas lacked vegetation. By July 2000, the vegetation appeared recovered in terms of visual appearance. Though plant recovery probably took more than twice as long as predicted, vegetation recovery time was relatively normal, perhaps even rapid, compared to temperate zone marshes.

AB  - Systematic mass spectrometric 230Th ages are reported for aPorites coral reef terrace from Dengloujiao, Leizhou Peninsula, South China Sea. Seven episodes of coral growth were recognized in this terrace: 7125±96, 6764±29, 5826±37, 5006±54, 2543±24,1915±15, and 1513±22 calendar years before present (cal. aBP). 50% of the coral age population fall between 7200 and 6600 cal. aBP, marking post-glacial stabilization of global sea level. Considering the facts that (i) Dengloujiao reef flat was measured at 1.6–2.5 m above modern tidal datum plane; (ii) modernPorites corals in the South China Sea are living at least ∼1 m below the modern tidal datum plane; (iii) the top 20–30 cm of the reef was eroded; and (iv) crustal subsidence in the region since mid-Holocene was negligible, we conclude that the above age groups record at least two major periods (7200–5000 and 2500–1500 cal. aBP) of high sea-level at least 2.9–3.8 m above the present-day level.

AB  - Artificial reefs are common human-made structures placed purposefully on the seabed for fishery enhancement and coastal protection. The local flow patterns could be further created and designed by perforated artificial reefs to become more inhabitable for different fish species, which attracts more attentions from researchers. Thus, based on the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technology, the primary focus of this research is to investigate the flow field of perforated artificial reefs arranged longitudinally with two perforated blocks, and to compare with the flow field of the single reef with the same structure. The results show that, the turbulent flow regime inside and outside the twin-block perforated reef consists of vortices interaction patterns and the main flow becomes weaker along the current direction. Several vortices with different scales are formed inside and behind the reef, and the vortex structure displays certain symmetry in the transverse direction because of symmetrical reef structure. Comparing with the flow field of a single perforated reef, the increase in reef number has little effect on the vertically vortical structure within the reef compartments. However, the influence range and sheltering effect induced by the twin-block reef becomes greater than that in the single reef. This research reveals the geometrical relationship between perforated reef structure and internal flow pattern, and provides a scientific guidance for optimizing the structure and deployment of perforated artificial reefs.

AB  - For centuries flood embankments were constructed to protect the lowlands, properties and the people living within. They are constructed along the coasts and rivers mainly as an earth structures using the fill material that is available on site. Flood embankments are built as "open" structures and have to withstand extreme internal and external processes, such as desiccation or flooding. As the body of the embankment is usually located above the ground, the fill material undergoes series of seasonal variations in climatic conditions which crucially affect the water retention in soils; as a result they swell and shrink. The shrinkage of soils is commonly associated with the formation of cracks, which affect the permeability of the soil. It is usually very difficult to visually assess the extent of cracking covered by vegetation. In this paper, both 2-D and 3-D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) were used to detect desiccation cracking in the soil mass. Two laboratory models, small and macro-scaled, were examined using miniature resistivity array. In addition to that, field investigation was carried out in order to validate laboratory results and in particular to assess the integrity of flood embankment. The results obtained in this research confirm that ERT is capable of detecting desiccation cracking in the subsurface without interfering into the embankment body and can be used for the proper assessment of an embankment body.

AB  - <jats:p>A small intelligence robot (SSR) is a special military intelligence means. It is used to obtain information about the enemy – the collection of intelligence, the search for targets and target indication, observation of the situation, etc. The use of a small intelligence robot is assumed in various natural and climatic conditions: in temperate terrain, on soils with low bearing capacity, at low temperatures, in the desert, on sandy and marshy soils, on rocky soils, in elevated temperature and dustiness of air, and also in conditions highlands In the article an overview of modern developments of remotely controlled robotic military complexes, principles of their construction and perspective directions of development in the armed forces are reviewed. The issues of robotization of existing weapons and military equipment are considered. Every sample of a SSR used in combat action must possess all combat characteristics at once in an optimal ratio between them, ensuring its maximum effectiveness. Ignoring any of the properties or enhancing one property at the expense of others will not enable the full realization of the small surveillance robot. It is reasonable to select the relevant properties at the design stage, using the possibilities of mathematical modeling. The set of tactical and technical characteristics of the SSR allowed forming this. Its characteristics determine the scope and possibilities of application. The mathematical model of the SSR motion is written in the Matlab Simulink environment. Recorded mathematical model of SSR motion, formed single test cycle and input data allowed to conduct computer simulation of motion in possible conditions of operation of small surveillance robot. The single trial cycle presented contains a set of individual sites and reproduces the testing test cycle of a real polygon. On the basis of the developed tactical and technical characteristics of the SSR, the experimental sample was made. An example of the use of SSR for the intelligence of the settlement and at keeping the node of barriers has been provided. The efficiency of performing intelligence units’ tasks and reducing the risk of human losses are shown. Keywords: small surveillance robot, design, mathematical modeling, combat use.</jats:p>

AB  - To determine the importance of microorganisms in regulating the retention of anthropogenic NO3-, we followed the belowground fate and flow of 15NO3- in a mature northern hardwood forest, dominated by Acer saccharum Marsh. Total recovery of added15N (29.5 mg 15N/m2 as NaNO3) in inorganic N, microbial immobilization in forest floor and soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and root biomass pools (0-10 cm depth) was 93% two hours following application of the 15NO3- but rapidly dropped to ~29% within one month, presumably due to movement of the isotope into other plant tissues or deeper into soil. Microbial immobilization was initially (i.e., at 2 h) the largest sink for 15NO3- (21% in forest floor; 16% in soil microbial biomass). After one month, total 15N recovery varied little (24-18%) throughout the remainder of the growing season, suggesting that the major N transfers among pools occurred relatively rapidly. At the end of the four-month experiment, the main fates of the 15N label were in soil organic matter (7%), root biomass (6%), and N immobilized in forest floor and soil microbial biomass (6%). Temporal changes in the 15N enrichment (atom % excess 15N) of plant and soil pools during the first month of the experiment indicated the dynamic nature of NO3- cycling in this forest. The 15N enrichment of soil microbial biomass and the forest floor significantly increased two hours after isotope additions, suggesting rapid microbial immobilization of NO3-. In contrast, the 15N enrichment of soil organic matter did not peak until day 1, presumably because much of the added 15N cycled through microorganisms before becoming stabilized in soil organic matter, or it directly entered soil organic matter via physical processes. Furthermore, the 15N enrichment of root biomass (<0.5-mm diameter and 0.5- 2.0 mm diameter) was greatest between day 7 and day 28, following significant increases in the 15N enrichment of soil organic matter (day 1) and, more importantly, NH4+ (day 2). From these data we conclude that microorganisms are immediate, short-term sinks for anthropogenic NO3-. Although the long-term fate of NO3- additions to this forest is likely in soil organic matter and plants, the cycling of N through microorganisms appears to be the major short-term factor influencing patterns of NO3- retention in this ecosystem.

AB  - This research aims at discussing the role of environmental planning, its progress to date and the challenges that arise, all while focusing on coastal cities. In the context of the integrated environmental planning on the coastal front of the cities, it is considered necessary to adopt the protect - accommodate - retreat target. For this purpose, various alternative protective methods and projects are examined, as well as their applicability and degree of acceptance today. The exploitation of natural infrastructure is presented as a relevant alternative to the traditional methods of engineered solutions and mechanical shielding of the coastal front, as protective measures. Currently, there is scientific consensus on the use of natural infrastructure for coastal protection as an innovative and flexible method, easily adaptable to the local conditions, securing additional environmental benefits for the city. In coastal cities, these methods are also employed to tackle challenges and weaknesses resulting from their nature, as ecosystems face additional pressures due to their location within an urban environment. Most coastal cities using natural infrastructure are in the regions of Southeast Asia and the USA. Regarding hybrid approaches of coastal protection, New York appears to be the first city to have developed and implemented such hybrid methods. The research concludes that although natural infrastructure appears to be the desired and more sustainable solution for the protection of cities’ coastal front, the implementation of hybrid systems, i.e. the combination of engineered projects and natural infrastructure, is considered more feasible. When choosing hybrid systems, already constructed engineered projects are utilized, benefits of both methods are exploited, while the existence of a “double line” of defense increases the levels of protection of the coastal front and integrates smoothly the water element within the city.

AB  - At the East-Frisian coast (Germany) morphological changes of tidal inlets – anthropogenically or naturally caused – can have substantial effects on the sediment supply of adjacent beaches. Erosion periods of beach and dune areas occur, which necessitate engineering countermeasures to preserve the present shoreline. The East-Frisian barrier islands are integrated into the coastal protection strategy for the mainland as they reduce the impact of sea-forces on the flood defences. On the other hand, shoreline and foredunes have to be maintained to protect the urban and tourism infrastructures on the island itself. The maintenance by solid engineering works, like seawalls and groynes, is not favourable because it has drawbacks on the natural morphodynamic processes. Therefore, the technique of beach- and foreshore nourishment is implemented as an instrument of ‘active coastal protection’ whenever possible. The paper deals with an actual erosion problem on the island of Langeoog caused by morphological changes of its tidal inlet Accumer Ee. It discusses the longterm morphological development of the tidal inlet with its ebb delta shoals and of the adjacent shoreline. A coastal engineering solution for the coastal defence problem has been achieved by means of an integrative approach regarding the natural morphological processes, the ecological objectives, and the safety of the island population.

AB  - Abstract. Mangrove, the intertidal halophytic vegetation, are one of the most significant and diverse ecosystem in the world. They protect the coast from sea erosion and other natural disasters like tsunami and cyclone. In view of their increased destruction and degradation in the current scenario, mapping of this vegetation is at priority. Globally researchers mapped mangrove vegetation using visual interpretation method or digital classification approaches or a combination of both (hybrid) approaches using varied spatial and spectral data sets. In the recent past techniques have been developed to extract these coastal vegetation automatically using varied algorithms. In the current study we tried to delineate mangrove vegetation using LISS III and Landsat 8 data sets for selected locations of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Towards this we made an attempt to use segmentation method, that characterize the mangrove vegetation based on their tone and the texture and the pixel based classification method, where the mangroves are identified based on their pixel values. The results obtained from the both approaches are validated using maps available for the region selected and obtained better accuracy with respect to their delineation. The main focus of this paper is simplicity of the methods and the availability of the data on which these methods are applied as these data (Landsat) are readily available for many regions. Our methods are very flexible and can be applied on any region.

AB  - Marine ecosystems directly and indirectly impact human health, providing benefits such as essential food sources, coastal protection and biomedical compounds. Monitoring changes in marine species is important because impacts such as overfishing, ocean acidification and hypoxic zones can negatively affect both human and ocean health. The US west coast supports a diverse assemblage of deep-sea corals that provide habitats for fish and numerous other invertebrates. Currently, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists manually track the health of coral species using extractive methods. In this paper, we test the viability of using a machine learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify coral species, using field-collected coral images in collaboration with NOAA. We fine tune the hyperparameters of our model to surpass the human F-score. We also highlight a scalable opportunity to monitor ocean health automatically while preserving corals.

AB  - We generated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data from 402 individuals of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta collected from 11 native populations and analyzed these data using a combination of demographic, phylogenetic, and phylogeographic methods to infer features of the evolutionary history of this species. Prior expectations regarding high levels of genetic structure and isolation by distance among populations were supported by the data, but we also discovered several unanticipated patterns. Our analyses revealed a major genetic break between S. invicta mtDNA haplotypes that coincides with the Mesopotamia wetlands region of South America, resulting in two higher level nested clade groupings. In addition, we identified contrasting patterns of genetic differentiation within these two major groups, which may reflect differences in connectivity of suitable habitat in different parts of the native range of S. invicta. Our study represents the first attempt to understand the phylogeographic history of S. invicta across its native range.

AB  - Coastal vegetation acts as a natural barrier at many coastal zones, protecting the landside against wave effects and coastal erosion. It is known that coastal vegetation affects wave properties, and studies regarding this topic have been made in a wide variety, mostly focusing on wave attenuation. In this study, laboratory experiments have been conducted in a wave basin to inspect the effect of an emergent vegetation on wave attenuation, wave transformation and wave kinematics. A blank area is present along the reed field, which enables energy transformation during wave propagation. Three different regular waves have been sent to a natural reed field, and wave heights and kinematics have been measured around the structure. The results indicate that crest-parallel energy transmission takes place as the waves propagate along the reed field, which is boosted at the end of the reed, and the transmission becomes faster on waves with higher wave steepness. Measured water particle velocities have been evaluated to obtain the steady-cyclic and fluctuation components, by which, turbulence intensities in front and at the wake of the reed field have been evaluated. The results indicate that turbulence intensity increases at the mid-depth at the wake of the structure, becoming higher with increasing wave steepness. Thus, one may conclude that energy dissipation takes further place after the end of the reed field due to turbulence. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - The Louisiana Coastal Area presents an array of rich and urgent scientific problems that require new computational approaches. These problems are interconnected with common components: hurricane activity is aggravated by ongoing wetland erosion; water circulation models are used in hurricane forecasts, ecological planning and emergency response; environmental sensors provide information for models of different processes with varying spatial and time scales. This has prompted programs to build an integrated, comprehensive, computational framework for meteorological, coastal, and ecological models. Dynamic and adaptive capabilities are crucially important for such a framework, providing the ability to integrate coupled models with real-time sensor information, or to enable deadline based scenarios and emergency decision control systems. This paper describes the ongoing development of a Dynamic Data Driven Application System for coastal and environmental applications (DynaCode), highlighting the challenges of providing accurate and timely forecasts for hurricane events.

AB  - The central Portuguese coast is recognized as the region most vulnerable to coastal erosion in Portugal, with the actual loss of territory exceeding the forecasts used in the 2010-2050 Coastal Zone Management Plan for the Ovar-Marinha sector. This study presents the first step in the development of the Coastal Protection Investment Support Tool, which aids coastal zone managers identifying cost-effective locations for coastal protection works. The objective of this paper is to assess likely ecosystem service value losses resulting from coastal erosion patterns, thereby using a benefits transfer approach in combination with coastal erosion projections. For a case study of the central Portuguese coast it is shown that the total value of coastal ecosystem services equals about E193 million per year, while expected ecosystem service value losses from coastal erosion amount to over E45 million per year by 2058. Given the value of coastal ecosystem services it may, therefore, be worthwhile to protect not only urban territory but also natural and altered coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The shoreline erosion is a major problem that persist world wide and seawall still remain as one of the most widely adopted coastal protection structure. The design of an efficient seawall should be such that overtopping is minimized even during coastal flooding and extreme events by maintaining its crest elevation as low as possible. This can be obtained with curved front face sea walls. Two such curved configurations have been chosen for the study. The experimental investigation on dynamic pressure variation along the surface of the seawall models placed over, a bed slope of 1 in 30 and subjected to the action of random waves following the PM spectrum were conducted. The results on the variations of dynamic pressures on the seaward face of both the models along the relative depth are compared and discussed.

AB  - Floodplain plant-herbivore-hydroperiod interactions have received little attention despite their potential as determinants of floodplain structure and functioning. We used five types of exclosures to differentially exclude small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals from accessing Fremont cottonwood (Populus deltoides Marshall subsp. wizlizenii (Watson) Eckenwalder) seedlings and saplings growing naturally on four landform types at an alluvial reach on each of two rivers, the Green and Yampa, in Colorado and Utah. The two study reaches differed primarily as a result of flow regulation on the Green River, which began in 1962. Landforms were a rarely flooded portion of the alluvial plain, geomorphically active slow- and fast-water channel margin sites on the Yampa reach, and an aggrading side channel on the Green. Small-mammal live-trapping and observational data indicated that, with minor exceptions, the kinds of mammals eating cottonwood within each reach were identical. We monitored condition and fates of individual cottonwood plants from October 1993 through the 1997 growing season. Differences in survival and growth were noted both within and between reaches, and both due to, and independent of, mammalian herbivory. Comparisons of cottonwood growth and survivorship among exclosures and between exclosures and controls indicated that a small mammal, Microtus montanus, reduced seedling and sapling survivorship at the Green River reach, but to a lesser extent (seedlings) or not at all (saplings) on the Yampa reach. In contrast, reductions in sapling height increment attributable to medium- and large-sized herbivores were detected only at the Yampa site. We suggest that these differences are a result of (1) flow regulation allowing Microtus populations to escape the mortality normally accompanying the large, snowmelt-driven spring flood, as well as regulation promoting a herbaceous understory favorable to voles, and (2) greater browsing pressure from overwintering deer and elk at the Yampa reach, unrelated to flow regulation. Within areas used by foraging beaver, the probability of a sapling being cut by beaver was similar on the two reaches. This study suggests that changes in riparian plant-herbivore relationships due to shifts in river hydrology may be a common and important consequence of river regulation.

AB  - In the Danish Wadden Sea area the main coastal problem is the risk of flooding while coast erosion only takes place in a few small localities and in larger measure at the peninsula of Skallingen. In the Danish Wadden Sea area some 100 km of dike protects the lowlying areas, the marsh areas, against flooding. Through the years the dike protection has been extended and reinforced. Since the 1970s, the frequency of storm surges has been much higher than earlier in this century. These surges have worn the dikes and many reinforcements have been carried out, and two new dikes have been built protecting the towns Ribe and Hojer. The Danish dikes have always been green dikes, i.e. they are grass covered. They are rather easy to reinforce if necessary to withstand also a relative sea level rise caused by the green house effect, the continuing land subsidence in this area or possible more frequent and higher storm surges in the future.

AB  - The four largest Swedish lakes, Vanern, Vattern, Hjalmaren, and Malaren, were surveyed by means of aerial IR-color photography in the 1970s. Along small slope gradients in all lakes the emergent communities extended to a width of hundreds of meters, while the extent on steeper slopes was a few meters. Because of the fractionate shape, L. Malaren has a very long shoreline, which promotes vegetation growth in the transition zone between land and water. Sheltered conditions are numerous and water lilies and other floating leaved and freely floating plants are abundant. Emergent as well as submerged macrophytes grow vigorously in the northernmost part of the oligotrophic lake Vattern. In L. Vanern exposed shores pre-dominate, but sheltered bays and archipelagos are overgrown with reeds. In the shallow lake Hjalmaren monospecific stands of Phragmites australis are dominant. Recurrent surveys of L. Malaren and L. Vanern in the 1990s showed changes that could be connected to the watertable fluctuations, which have been stabilized since the first investigation. Reeds and water lilies expanded in sheltered parts of the lakes, while the distribution of reed stands growing at their deep limit decreased.

AB  - The objective of the current work is to simulate the influence of a Wave Dragon farm operating in the vicinity of the Romanian nearshore, more precisely in the Mangalia sector. As a first step, the Simulatring Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model was initially used to identify the wave conditions from the vicinity of the target area in order to highlight the main wave characteristics for a ten-year time interval (between 1999 and 2008). Some relevant wave patterns were identified based on this data, which were further used to determine the influence of the Wave Dragon systems on the local wave heights distribution. The physical implementation of the wave farm in the geographical space was possible by considering the obstacle command, which is included in the SWAN model. The shielding effect induced by the wave farm is more significant in the case of the average and extreme scenarios, which suggest that beside the production of electricity such projects, could be considered also suitable for the coastal protection on a local level.

AB  - Bangladesh exemplifies the complex challenges facing densely populated coastal regions. The pressures on the country are immense: around 145 million people live within an area of just 145,000 sq-km at the confluence of three major river systems: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. While progress has been made, poverty remains widespread, with around 39% of children under five malnourished. Most of its land-mass lies below 10m above sea level with considerable areas at sea level, leading to frequent and prolonged flooding during the monsoons. Sea level rise is leading to more flooding as storm surges rise off higher sea levels, pushing further inland. Higher sea levels also result in salt-water intrusion into freshwater coastal aquifers and estuaries, contaminating drinking water and farmland. Warmer ocean waters are also expected to lead to an increase in the intensity of tropical storms. Bangladesh depends on the South Asian summer monsoon for most of its rainfall which is expected to increase, leading to more flooding. Climate scientists are also concerned about the stability of monsoon and the potential for it to undergo a nonlinear phase shift to a drier regime. Bangladesh faces an additional hydrological challenge in that the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers both rise in the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau region, where glaciers are melting rapidly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that rapid melting is expected to increase river flows until around the late-2030s, by which time the glaciers are expected to have shrunk from their 1995 extent of 500,000 sq-km to an expected 100,000 sqkm. After the 2030s, river flows could drop dramatically, turning the great glacier-fed rivers of Asia into seasonal monsoon-fed rivers. The IPCC concluded that as a result, water shortages in Asia could affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. Over the same period, crop yields are expected to decline by up to 30% in South Asia due to a combination of drought and crop heat stress. Bangladesh is therefore likely to face substantial challenges in the coming decades. In order to adequately understand the complex, dynamic, spatial and nonlinear challenges facing Bangladesh, an integrated model of the system is required. An agent-based model (ABM) permits the dynamic interactions of the economic, social, political, geographic, environmental and epidemiological dimensions of climate change impacts and adaptation policies to be integrated via a modular approach. Integrating these dimensions, including nonlinear threshold events such as mass migrations, or the outbreak of conflicts or epidemics, is possible to a far greater degree with an ABM than with most other approaches. We are developing a prototype ABM, implemented in Netlogo, to examine the dynamic impacts on poverty, migration, mortality and conflict from climate change in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2100. The model employs GIS and sub-district level census and economic data and a coarse-graining methodology to allow model statistics to be generated on a national scale from local dynamic interactions. This approach allows a more realistic treatment of distributed spatial events and heterogeneity across the country. The aim is not to generate precise predictions of Bangladesh’s evolution, but to develop a framework that can be used for integrated scenario exploration. This paper represents an initial report on progress on this project. So far the prototype model has demonstrated the desirability and feasibility of integrating the different dimensions of the complex adaptive system and, once completed, is intended to be used as the basis for a more detailed policy-oriented model.

AB  - The 1500 km-long coast of South America between the Amazon and the Orinoco river mouths is the world's muddiest. This is due to the huge suspended-sediment discharge of the Amazon River (10... x 754 tons yr... ± 9%), part of which is transported alongshore as mud banks. Mud-bank formation is controlled by the physical oceanography of the continental shelf seaward of the Amazon River mouth, an initial seafloor storage area for much of the suspended sediment discharged from the river. In this area, rapid and sustained fluid-mud concentration and trapping are associated with fresh water-salt water interaction and estuarine front activity on the shelf due to the enormous Amazon water discharge (ca. 173,000 m... s... at Obidos, 900 km upstream of the mouth). Fluid mud is transported shoreward and then along the coasts of the Guianas by a complex interaction of wave and tidal forcing, and wind-generated coastal currents. The mud banks, which may number up to 15 or more at any time, are up to 5 m-thick, 10 to 60 km-long, and 20 to 30 km-wide, and each may contain the equivalent mass of the annual mud supply of the Amazon. As the banks migrate alongshore, their interaction with waves results in complex and markedly fluctuating shorelines that are associated with space- and time-varying depositional 'bank' phases and erosional 'inter-bank' phases. Bank zones are protected from wave attack as a result of wave-energy dampening by mud, and undergo significant, albeit temporary, coastal accretion accompanied by rapid mangrove colonization. The dampening of waves in bank areas as they propagate onshore is accompanied by the shoreward recycling of mud, commonly in the form of individual mud bars. These bars progressively undergo desiccation and consolidation, and thus constitute a major pathway for rapid and massive colonization by mangroves. Erosion by waves propagating across relatively mud-deficient shoreface zones in inter-bank areas can lead to muddy shoreline retreat rates of tens of metres to several kilometres over a few months to a few years, accompanied by massive removal of mangroves. Notwithstanding the higher incident wave energy on inter-bank shores, inter-bank shorefaces are permanently muddy due to the pervasive influence of the Amazon muddy discharge. Inter-bank and transitional bank-to-inter-bank phases are associated with both periodic sandy chenier formation and extreme forms of rotation of rare headland-bound sandy beaches. The high mud supply from the Amazon has been the overarching geological control on the Quaternary evolution of the northeastern South American coast, having led to the growth of a muddy shelf clinoform at the mouth of the Amazon and more or less important progradation throughout this coast. Net progradation reflects an imbalance in favour of deposition during each mud-bank-inter-bank cycle. The high mud supply has presumably blanketed shelf sand deposited by smaller rivers during eustatic lowstand phases. The shelf clinoform structure at the mouth of the Amazon and the muddy coastal progradation throughout the coast of the Guianas and into Venezuela provide analogues of the geological record on muddy shorefaces.

AB  - Coastal erosion processes are often due to inappropriate coastal defense strategies. The construction of infrastructures that interfere with the coastal circulation and the sediment transport along the coast (piers, docks, etc.), the destruction of the dunes and other anthropogenic modifications to the beach, are some of the factors that limit the adaptability of the beach system and amplify the risk of erosion and flooding of the coastal land. Coastal defense interventions have historically been based on the construction of rigid works (seawalls, groins, breakwaters, jetties, etc.), which, while protecting the territory, have often shifted the problem of erosion to the neighboring coasts. The paper will present the contents and the first findings of the research project STIMARE (Innovative strategies, monitoring and analysis of the coastal erosion risk), financed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Sea (MATTM), aimed to define strategies for coastal management, based on a strong involvement of the stakeholders, and on the use of innovative or low-costs technologies for coastal monitoring. Methodology is based on data acquisition, numerical modelling, laboratory tests, physical and ecological monitoring. All the information and results will be discussed with the local stakeholders, in order to provide a comprehensive strategy for coastal protection, following the European Marine Strategy framework. The Project involves researchers from two important Universities in Italy (University of Bologna and Politecnico di Bari) and has a strong interdisciplinary approach, involving coastal engineers, urban planners, geologists, ecologists and mechanical engineers.

AB  - This work presents the approach strategy for the optimization of the coastal defence at a specific site in the Northern Adriatic Sea, the Reno river mouth (Italy). The area is extremely dynamic and vulnerable since exposed to several climate change related effects and in the last decades has suffered strong erosion processes. A rocky revetment covered by a superficial bituminous layer protects this coastal area, but the bad state of conservation makes this defense technique inadequate also during ordinary events. In addition, important morphological variations at the mouth (i.e., the human demolishing of the final part of the right riverside) affected the stability of the protection works and compromised the inland safety. The analysis of multipurpose coastal schemes for flood mitigation and coastal defence of the area is carried out by means of the well-known commercial software MIKE21, that was implemented to simulate waves (SW), currents and levels (HD) and sediment transport (ST). Different sea events from NW (Bora) and SE (Scirocco) were reproduced in the site, also including tidal level, storm surge and river discharge associated to the reproduced storm. Current configuration of the area and alternative defence schemes (i.e. breakwater, groins) to improve coastal protection were simulated and the numerical results were compared in terms of wave load, inundation rate and bed level change. The condition of Bora with the simultaneous presence of high tidal level results to be the most severe event, since the developed longshore current contrasts the river outflow, leading to a high probability of fluvial flooding of the area. The comparative numerical analysis of the different scenarios and configurations allows estimating the optimal coastal protection scheme both in terms of flooding mitigation and erosion reduction and the implemented model can be a useful tool for future studies regarding a so vulnerable and dynamic area.

AB  - A cluster of artesian springs encircled by mounds of marsh and wet meadows was discovered near the equator in Kenya, East Africa. Each spring is capped by a dense fibrous root mat that covers a mound of clayey peat with a blister of water in the center. Individual mounds are similar to 15 m wide, 1-2 m high, and affect an area of similar to 50 m2. The central water-blister volume is <1 m3. The arched semi-permeable vegetation cap appears to be buoyed upward by slow artesian flow that leaks through the cap and moves slowly away. Lush plant growth (Poaceae and Cyperaceae, algae, diatoms, and filamentous cyanobacteria) is supported even through the dry season (Dec.-Feb.). The term 'artesian blister wetland' is proposed for this unusual marsh, which has not been described previously. Approximately 20 small, circular-to-oval artesian blister wetlands occur within a large spring and wetland complex ( similar to 1.3 km2) that includes several freshwater Typha marshes fed by ground-water seeps. The springs discharge along a rift-related fracture system near the contact between volcanic bedrock and late Quaternary sediments. Cores (1-2 m) through the mounds revealed a dense root mat underlain by water in the center and a clayey peat that is locally pebbly at the base surrounding the blister. LOI in the clayey peat decreases from 75% at surface to similar to 10% at 0.4-1.2 m. Blister water is cool, fresh, and dysaerobic (T = 30-33 degree C; pH = 6.2-7.2; conductivity similar to 600 iS/cm; and DO = 50%; 0.6-3.5 mg/l). The spring/wetland mounds likely form by the blanketing of the land around the spring orifice with vegetation (paludification). Plants and cyanobacteria seem to trap sediment transported by surface run-off and wind. The mound grows with time, but its height is limited by the magnitude of the hydraulic head. These ecological niches are important freshwater resources for animals and humans in semi-arid environments.

AB  - Freshwater environments are important for ecosystem services and biodiversity. These environments are subject to many natural and anthropogenic changes, which influence their quality; therefore, regular monitoring is required for their effective management. High biotic heterogeneity, elongated land/water interaction zones, and logistic difficulties with access make field based monitoring on a large scale expensive, inconsistent and often impractical. Remote sensing (RS) is an established mapping tool that overcomes these barriers. However, complex and heterogeneous vegetation and spectral variability due to water make freshwater environments challenging to map using remote sensing technology. Satellite images available for New Zealand were reviewed, in terms of cost, and spectral and spatial resolution. Particularly promising image data sets for freshwater mapping include the QuickBird and SPOT-5. However, for mapping freshwater environments a combination of images is required to obtain high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution. Data fusion (DF) is a framework of data processing tools and algorithms that combines images to improve spectral and spatial qualities. A range of DF techniques were reviewed and tested for performance using panchromatic and multispectral QB images of a semi-aquatic environment, on the southern shores of Lake Taupo, New Zealand. In order to discuss the mechanics of different DF techniques a classification consisting of three groups was used - (i) spatially-centric (ii) spectrally-centric and (iii) hybrid. Subtract resolution merge (SRM) is a hybrid technique and this research demonstrated that for a semi aquatic QuickBird image it out performed Brovey transformation (BT), principal component substitution (PCS), local mean and variance matching (LMVM), and optimised high pass filter addition (OHPFA). However some limitations were identified with SRM, which included the requirement for predetermined band weights, and the over-representation of the spatial edges in the NIR bands due to their high spectral variance. This research developed three modifications to the SRM technique that addressed these limitations. These were tested on QuickBird (QB), SPOT-5, and Vexcel aerial digital images, as well as a scanned coloured aerial photograph. A visual qualitative assessment and a range of spectral and spatial quantitative metrics were used to evaluate these modifications. These included spectral correlation and root mean squared error (RMSE), Sobel filter based spatial edges RMSE, and unsupervised classification. The first modification addressed the issue of predetermined spectral weights and explored two alternative regression methods (Least Absolute Deviation, and Ordinary Least Squares) to derive image-specific band weights for use in SRM. Both methods were found equally effective; however, OLS was preferred as it was more efficient in processing band weights compared to LAD. The second modification used a pixel block averaging function on high resolution panchromatic images to…

AB  - Tanjung Piai, Johor, Malaysia, is a ramsar site, located at the southern-most tip of mainland Asia, and consists mainly of mudflats and mangrove forests. The coast has experienced severe erosion for several decades, in spite of the construction of various coastal defense structures. The reported rates of shoreline retreat were between 2 m/year to 4 m/year. Hydrodynamic modeling using 2008 field data indicate that the maximum current speed observed along the east coast of Tanjung Piai ranges from 0.2 m/s-0.5 m/s, while the west coast experiences lower current speeds of less than 0.2 m/s. Strong currents occur at the tip of Tanjung Piai with a speed of 0.5 m/s to 0.8 m/s. The simulation also indicates that some local current patterns are formed near the tip due to the presence of a small island as the flow entering the study area during flooding were reflected to the east while the flow during the ebb tide tend to move toward the opposite direction.

AB  - ABSTRACT A spill of heavy fuel oil in the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, North Carolina, impacted approximately 30 miles of shoreline. The vegetation was of a high marsh type dominated by species of Spartina, Scirpus, and Juncus. The particular water-insoluble, hydrophobic characteristics of the oil caused it to adhere predominantly to marsh vegetation. To determine the amount of oil onshore it was necessary to determine marsh grass surface areas. Aerial reconnaissance established the locations of major, moderate, and low impact areas and allowed the production of an environmental data map. Ground reconnaissance was used to obtain widths of impacted marsh and to identify dominant marsh vegetation components. Transect measurements completed the data acquisition and yielded surface areas. The amount of surface area submerged at mean high tide (and, therefore, subject to oiling) was determined separately for Spartina alterniflora, S. cynosuroides, Scirpus olneyi, and Juncus effusus. Geometric formulas used were based upon the surface morphology of each plant. A stepwide procedure is given for application of the methods to other spills and to other common marsh species. Surface areas for flowering S. alterniflora ranged from about 700-to-l,500 square centimeters per plant. The leaf area was approximately twice the area of the stem. Revisits to the spill site indicated that much of the oil had been exported from lightly oiled areas, and that these areas had recovered. However, heavily oiled areas showed a reduction in total plants per square meter and much contamination of surface sediments and substrate.

AB  - Oil spill research and development has involved a large number of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and the effects of marine shoreline protection and cleanup techniques. Considerable knowledge has accumulated from laboratory and wave tank studies, and there have also been a number of field experiments, in which oil was intentionally spilled on shorelines under controlled conditions. This review summarizes those field experiments, which are grouped in five major habitat types: rocky intertidal, cobble/pebble/gravel, sand/mud, saltmarshes, and mangroves/seagrasses. Tables included in the paper itemize the oil type and volume, location and substrate character, number and size of plots, response techniques tested, and referenced publications. This information is then used to combine understanding of the effectiveness of cleanup with understanding of the ecological effects of cleanup methods, compared with those of untreated oil. It is very difficult to achieve this type of information and understanding from toxicity testing or from spills of opportunity.

AB  - <jats:p>Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5&ndash;10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.</jats:p>

The rotifer Synchaeta spp., already abundant in the neighbouring salt and brackish lakes, profited from this condition. Higher and less fluctuating salinities caused the estuarine character of this compartment to disappear in the post-barrier years. This was reflected in the obscured succession of some Acartia species: the estuarine A. tonsa dominated in pre-barrier- and barrier years during summer, while the marine A. clausi was abundant in the post-barrier Oosterschelde during that time. Also the changed food conditions (Bakker & Vink, 1993) may have played a role in this phenomenon.

AB  - The concept of ecological integrity has become a worldwide phenomenon and is firmly entrenched into the regulatory structure of environmental law in the United States of America (USA). The attainment of ecological integrity requires the attainment of its three elements: physical, chemical, and biological integrity. In the USA, measures of chemical integrity were implemented first into monitoring programs and were effective in reducing pollutant loadings to the nation's surface waters. Because biological communities integrate the effects of different stressors such as reduced oxygen, excess nutrients, toxic chemicals, increased temperature, excessive sediment loading, and habitat degradation, the advent of bioassessment in regulatory programs has provided a more comprehensive and effective monitoring and assessment strategy. Measures of biological integrity clearly have become a priority in the USA. The development of biological criteria (biocriteria) within regulatory programs to serve as thresholds by which to judge the attainment of designated aquatic life conditions of surface waters is a major focus of states and Indian tribes within the USA. The derivation of reference conditions for the nation's surface waters (i.e., streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters) across different physiographic regions is a critical element in the design of biocriteria and is currently a primary initiative in the USA. Nearly all state water resource agencies have developed bioassessment approaches for streams; 1600 to 75 000 km of streams require assessment in each state. Bioassessment development for other water body types is not as advanced to date. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has produced technical guidance for developing effective bioassessment programs; they include crucial elements such as defining objectives, classifying water bodies according to expected biological attributes, deriving the reference condition of the site classes, developing standardized protocols for sampling and data analysis, and implementing a quality assurance plan. Approaches to bioassessment in the USA follow a basic design of incorporating various attributes of the elements and processes of the aquatic community, which is either an aggregation into a multimetric index or a series of multivariate analyses using the attributes as input variables. The Clean Water Act of 1972 and its subsequent amendments mandate maintaining, restoring, and protecting the ecological integrity of surface waters. Through use of robust bioassessments and other measures of ecological integrity, the USA has developed a strategic plan to establish priorities to meet this goal.

AB  - River restoration and bioengineering programs commonly use vegetation to stabilize banks. For this, it is important to know the forces that the flowing river water exerts on the vegetation. To this end, a laboratory study was performed at the USDA-ARS National Sedimentation Laboratory. Dowels were used to simulate emergent rigid vegetation. Dowels were systematically placed in the laboratory flume, beginning with a single dowel connected to a load cell to measure the drag force and then placing dowels around the single dowel to determine any shielding effect. It was found that the drag coefficient of a single dowel ranged from 4.5 to 6.5, which is higher than that published for a 2-D cylinder of infinite length. A momentum balance analysis shows that (1) for the single dowel case, the momentum balance approach determines C D>>1 contrary to the low values for a cylinder and (2) the C D for the measured dowel is about two times higher than the momentum formulation. This difference is attributed to the presence of large standing waves upstream of the dowel and the breaking of these waves. When additional vegetation elements were added to form a matrix, it was found that as vegetation elements were added, the drag forced increased initially due to the vegetation concentrating the flow towards the instrumented dowel, and then decreased due to dowels being directly upstream of the instrumented dowel and thereby blocking the flow. These results have implications for managed planting arrangements in stream corridor rehabilitation programs.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are being lost globally at an alarming rate due to deforestation, reclamation, and urbanization. Not only is the loss of these ecosystems detrimental to the commercially and ecologically important marine species they support, there is also a reduction in the ecosystem services they provide, namely mitigating rising carbon dioxide levels by serving as carbon sinks. These ecosystems, labeled as "blue carbon" sinks, potentially sequester more than 10 times the carbon that tropical and temperate ecosystems do. Thus, conservation and restoration of these blue carbon sinks is imperative. We explored how much carbon is currently stored in dwarf red mangrove Rhizophora mangle biomass in tidal creeks of Eleuthera, Bahamas. In October of 2012, four sites were selected near Cape Eleuthera, maximizing site variability. All sampling was done from six plots established at each site. The quantity of carbon stored in mangroves was determined from plant biomass, which was extrapolated from plant volumes. Mangrove volumes were determined from growth parameters of individuals. It was observed that there were large differences from site to site in number of individuals, sediment depth, biomass accumulation, and carbon allocation of mangroves, but the total amount of carbon stored from site to site in mangroves did not differ. The site with the greatest biomass and carbon storage also had the greatest sediment depth, suggesting a correlation between the two. Regardless of the site to site variability, mangroves proved to be good stores for carbon. Future work should search for the factors that explain site to site variability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of climate variability and landuse change in the Susquehanna river basin on the sedimentary regime of the Upper Chesapeake Bay, USA. Historical precipitation, stream discharge, land use, suspended sediment and dam reservoir capacity data were used to interpret regional patterns of erosion and sediment transport on annual, decadal and centennial time-scales. Sediment accumulation patterns in the Upper Chesapeake Bay were inferred from the analysis of four piston cores including C-14 dating, magnetic susceptibility and laser particle analysis techniques. Core magnetic susceptibility profiles were found to be a useful tool for stratigraphic correlation on the order of centimeters. On annual to decadal time-scales, a strong relationship was found between sediment yield and regional rainfall-runoff patterns and land surface erodibility. However, on centennial time-scales, our research suggests that anthropogenic land -use change (e.g., clear-cutting of native forests) has caused up to an order of magnitude increase in sediment accumulation rates-in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, the signature of extreme hydrologic events such as large floods and droughts, and thus Anatural@ climate variability, wag "aliased" from the estuarine sedimentation patterns over the last 150 years. The construction of major dams around 1930 on the Lower Susquehanna River has resulted in a significant decrease in coarse fraction of sediment inputs into the estuary, further reducing our ability to separate flood episodes from average conditions.

AB  - Sediment is a fragmented material, primarily formed by the physical and chemical disintegration of rocks from the earth`s crust. These particles range in size from large boulders to colloidal size fragments and vary in shape from rounded to angular and vary in specific gravity, and mineral composition (Rijn, L. C. V. 1993). Sediment materials are classified and named based on their grain sizes. In a tropical peat coast, the sediment consists of sand, mud, and peat debris. The distribution of these grain size becomes very important because it connects to the sediment depository behind detached breakwater which leads to the recovery process of coastal erosion (mangrove replanting activity). This paper discusses the sediment grain size distribution behind detached breakwaters from the assessment of the field activity and numerical approach. The existing detached breakwater that was installed at the northern part of Bengkalis Island is called the Selatbaru coast. The measurements are based on geo-informatics composed of both terrestrial surveys and photogrammetry. For grain size measurement, we used image analysis and laser analysis methods. A 1D cross-shore profile model of Xbeach was chosen. The model used the option to define spatially varying sediment grain size. With this feature, it becomes possible to simulate the beach profile response to wave and tidal action in a variety of grain sizes. Analyzing the relationship between the field activity and numerical calculation of sediment grain size distribution will help determine recovery process to coastal erosion especially in the tropical coast of Bengkalis Island, Indonesia. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - <jats:sec> <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>The Elf company has developed a preventive means of fighting oil spills, involving a film forming product which must be applied to areas to be protected before they are reached by hydrocarbons. The goal is to reduce the adhesiveness of hydrocarbons, thus minimizing their ecological and aesthetic impact on coastal zones. The effectiveness of the product has already been tested by means of various experiments carried out on miscellaneous substrata. Simply washing the area with cold water under low pressure is sufficient to detach the oil from soiled surfaces where, usually, it is necessary to resort to high pressure hoses (possibly using hot water or even detergents). It is then possible to envisage, using traditional methods, to recover the petrol from the surface of the water.</jats:p> <jats:p>This paper discusses the results of impact studies which were carried out recently in various coastal ecosystems: sandy, rocky and salt-marsh sediments. Follow-up of sedimentary fauna and marsh flora have not revealed any impact, not even on the most sensitive ecosystems.</jats:p> <jats:p>Procedures for applying the film forming product using tools available in stocks of prevention equipment are also discussed. An experiment timetable has made it possible to optimize the next use of a spreading system using helicopters (Simplex), commonly used to apply dispersants.</jats:p> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title> <jats:p>Concerned to develop a procedure to protect coastlines against accidental hydrocarbon spills, the Elf company has perfected a product which constitutes a preventive means. This is a film forming product. This type of product is designed to be spread over the coast shortly before the petrol runs aground. Currently, only very few similar products exist. Some of these products are micro organisms which must be added to the surface of a sediment in a natural ecosystem. Others form a film which is not easily biodegradable and are therefore likely to damage the ecosystem. This product is of natural origin (polysaccharides). The characteristics of the polysaccharides used allow complexing with natural calcium and therefore better adhesiveness to the surface of the sediments to be protected. The other advantage of the product presented in our study is that it is rapidly biodegradable. This biodegradability is the reason why the product looses its effectiveness with time, although it nevertheless remains very efficient 6 days alter application to an inter-tidal area.</jats:p> <jats:p>The protection ensured by the film-forming product and the preservation of its effectiveness have previously been demonstrated during numerous experiments in the laboratory and in situ (90% protection for calcareous surfaces). These results were presented during the previous symposium (OME 1995).</jats:p> <jats:p>As the effectiveness of the product had been proven, it remained to assess any possible ecological impact, as well as methods of using it. This paper therefore presents the results of the impact study on a coastal shoreline and the process implementation protocol.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Impact study</jats:title> <jats:p>As the purpose was to ensure that the film-forming product was not harmful to the natural surroundings, in situ tests were carried out under conditions which, as far as possible, were similar to a real utilization and the possible impact on the fauna and flora of the tested sites was monitored.</jats:p> <jats:p>The CEDRE entrusted monitoring of the potential impact of the process to two university organizations which have specialized in this field since the accident of the Amoco Cadiz: the Marine Biology Laboratory of the University of West Brittany (Dr. C. Le Guellec) and the Botanical Laboratory of the University of Rennes I (Dr. J.E. Levasseur). P. 111</jats:p> </jats:sec> </jats:sec>

AB  - Waihi Beach is an example of chronic erosive tendency. The erosion problem is particularly bad at the northern end where a rock seawall was constructed in the 1960s in an attempt to protect coastal property at risk from coastal erosion and flooding hazards. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to identify and evaluate the fundamental coastal processes impacting upon erosion at Waihi Beach. Measured wave and current data combined with bathymetric and sediment data indicated that nearshore current velocities alone are incapable of inducing sediment movement and require wave motion to initiate entrainment. A net onshore flux of 2.6 m super( 3)/m/year was calculated for Waihi Beach, despite persistent rip currents at the far northern end of the beach producing offshore sediment transport at that location. The numerical wave model WBEND is used to examine the influence of wave refraction and convergence caused by Mayor Island and large shore-normal sand ridges ( eta =0.4-2.5 m, lambda =300-1400 m) revealed by side-scan sonar, on the distribution of wave energy along the coast. Using average wave conditions, a zone of wave convergence caused by refraction around Mayor Island was found to produce enhanced wave heights along a particularly erosive sector of the beach fronting the seawall. Zones of wave convergence caused by wave refraction over the offshore sand ridges were found to produce variation in alongshore breaking wave heights.

AB  - Shark River Inlet, located on the north New Jersey coast, is served by a federal navigation channel that has until recently required little maintenance dredging. Although possessing a small estuary, the inlet is hydraulically efficient because of the small width to depth ratio of its entrance that is stabilized by parallel jetties. After placement of approximately 4.8 million m3 of beach nourishment to the north and south of the inlet as part of an erosion-control project conducted in the late 1990s, inlet maintenance increased beyond that anticipated. Analysis of channel and nearshore surveys indicates that an ebb-tidal delta is forming where none had existed previously, attributed to the recent availability of sand from the beach nourishment and a lack of sand prior to that construction. Jetty tip shoals also encroach on the channel, dependent on season, with longshore transport directed primarily to the north during summer (the predominant direction of transport) and to the south during winter. Formation of the ebb delta must be accounted for in the sand budget of the adjacent beaches. After conducting a GIS analysis of ebb delta growth to understand geomorphic trends, the Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was established to numerically simulate waves, current, sand transport, and morphology change. The CMS reproduced observed trends in ebb-delta growth, and multi-year simulations indicate the time scale of approach to dynamic equilibrium of the ebb delta and establishment of natural sand bypassing at the inlet.

AB  - <jats:p><p><b>Coastal lagoons are important, but fragile ecosystems, which host diverse biological assemblages. However, these ecosystems are becoming increasingly exposed to anthropogenic stressors such as ocean warming and eutrophication. Sponges are important suspension feeders and are often important components of coastal lagoon communities. However, the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on lagoon-inhabiting sponges are poorly understood. This thesis examines the effects of elevated temperature and eutrophication on the physiological responses and temporal dynamics of three lagoon-inhabiting sponges, Neopetrosia chaliniformis, Amphimedon navalis and Spheciospongia vagabunda from Mauritius (western Indian Ocean). The effects of elevated temperature on A. navalis proteome dynamics and on the bentho-pelagic interactions of S. vagabunda were also explored. </b></p><p>In the first data chapter, I conducted a multifactorial experiment to investigate the short-term physiological responses of N. chaliniformis, A. navalis and S. vagabunda exposed to nine combinations of temperature and nitrate treatments for 14 days. Temperature treatments for this experiment were chosen based on the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways, i.e. RCP6.0 (+2 oC) and RCP8.5 (+4 oC) projected for the year 2100. Nitrate concentrations were increased to approximately two- and three-fold the actual nitrate concentrations in the lagoons where sponges were collected. After 14 days of exposure, the photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and effective quantum yield of the two photosynthetic species (N. chaliniformis and S. vagabunda), as well as the buoyant weight of all species declined significantly. The gross photosynthetic rates and P:R ratios of N. chaliniformis and S. vagabunda also declined significantly, but the respiration rates of all species were significantly higher. The results from this chapter demonstrated that while lagoon-inhabiting sponges are susceptible to short term exposure to elevated temperatures, they are generally tolerant to elevated nitrate concentrations. </p><p>For my second data chapter, I conducted a four-week thermal tolerance experiment to investigate the physiological tolerance of these three sponges to elevated temperature. I also explored the proteomic responses of A. navalis to elevated temperature. The results showed that the physiology of N. chaliniformis and A. navalis were impacted over time, where after one-week of thermal exposure, both species experienced significant loss in buoyant weight and increases in pumping and holobiont oxygen consumption rates, respectively. In contrast, the bioeroding sponge S. vagabunda experienced an increase in buoyant weight over time and after a thermal exposure of two weeks, the effective quantum yield, pumping and holobiont oxygen consumption rates of this species appeared to stabilize, indicating the possible acclimation of this species to longer thermal exposure. A. navalis proteomic analysis after four weeks revealed significant changes in the expression of 50 proteins, which were mainly involved in oxidative stress, protein transport and cytoskeletal organization. These results demonstrate that medium- or long-term thermal experiments are more indicative of possible species-specificity and acclimation potential in sponges. Moreover, this study also demonstrates that thermal stress responses are also reflected at the proteome level and that a combination of physiology and proteomics can further enhance our understanding of stress mechanisms in sponges. </p><p>In my third data chapter, I aimed to assess the temporal variability in local distribution area (LDA), abundance and percentage cover of N. chaliniformis, A. navalis and S. vagabunda, respectively over a six- to eight-year period. I also aimed to explore the possible relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (used as a proxy for eutrophication), and temporal variability of these sponges. I found that while he LDA and percentage cover of N. chaliniformis decreased by 40.2% and 14.6%, those of S. vagabunda increased by 135.1% and 23.3%, respectively. No significant changes were observed in A. navalis LDA and percentage cover. A significant decline was seen in the abundance of N. chaliniformis and A. navalis, whereas a significant increase was noted for S. vagabunda abundance. N. chaliniformis and A. navalis abundance declines were likely due to a reduction in lagoonal coral cover, which often act as anchoring substrate for these sponges. The abundance of all species was significantly correlated with SST and Chl a concentration, but the nature of these correlations was species-specific. These results showed that lagoon-inhabiting sponges demonstrate species-specific temporal dynamics, which are mostly driven by changes in seawater temperature. </p><p>For my final data chapter, I aimed to estimate the bacterial cell consumption, Chl a uptake, net dissolved organic carbon uptake and net inorganic nutrient release of S. vagabunda when exposed to elevated seawater temperature. The results from this chapter indicated that the bacterial cell consumption and S. vagabunda bentho-pelagic interactions with the water column are relatively low compared to other shallow coastal sponges for which data are available. However, under future ocean warming scenarios RCP6.0 (+2 oC) and RCP8.5 (+4 oC), S. vagabunda bacterial cell consumption, net dissolved organic carbon uptake and net inorganic nutrient release would likely increase by 115% and 142%, respectively. These results suggest that thermally tolerant lagoon-inhabiting sponges would likely have an enhanced bentho-pelagic role in future anthropogenically-impacted lagoons, although based on current abundance, S. vagabunda has limited bentho-pelagic interactions with the water column. </p><p>In summary, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the responses of lagoon-inhabiting sponges to elevated temperature are species-specific. While some species are thermally susceptible to elevated temperature, other species such as S. vagabunda may have a potential to acclimate to at least short-term thermal stress. Consequently, thermally-tolerant species could potentially have an increasing bentho-pelagic role in coastal lagoons under future climate change scenarios. The impacts of thermal stress in sponges can also occur at the proteome level, where cellular biological functions such as redox reactions, protein transport and cytoskeletal organization are significantly disrupted. Furthermore, elevated temperature can equally contribute to the temporal variability of some lagoon-inhabiting sponge species. In contrast, this study demonstrated that lagoon-inhabiting sponges are most likely tolerant to eutrophication. Given that sponges are important components of coastal lagoons, it is critically important to assess and incorporate their potential roles to the ecological functioning of anthropogenically-impacted coastal lagoons. </p></jats:p>

AB  - Flooding of the southern part of the North Sea occurred between 9000 and 8000 BP, when the rate of relative sea-level rise was on the order of 0.7 cm per year for the Dover Strait Region and 1.6 cm per year for the area north of the Frisian Islands, forcing the shoreline to recede rapidly. When relative sea-level rise decelerated after 7000 BP for the Belgian coast and 6000 BP for the central Netherlands coast, sediment supply by the tidal currents balanced the creation of accommodation space in the estuaries and other back-barrier basins. Consequently, the barrier started to stabilize, and the tidal basins and their inlets silted up. Between 5500 and 4500 BP, the Belgian coastal plain changed into a freshwater marsh with peat accumulation, and the same happened 500-1000 years later in the western provinces of the Netherlands. The E-W running barrier/back-barrier system of the Frisian Islands in the northern Netherlands stayed open until today, however, because of lower sediment supply. The period between 4000 and 2000 BP was relatively quiet due to the strong deceleration of the rate of sea-level rise; peat cushions developed behind the barriers, which were straightened by erosion of the headlands. Major and often catastrophic flooding occurred in the Middle Ages, when the estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands formed. About 226 ( plus or minus 15%) x 10 super(9) m super(3) sediment, mostly sand, is stored in the barriers and back-barrier basins of the Netherlands, 70% of which was deposited prior to 5000 BP. About 10% of the stored sediment is estimated to be of alluvial origin. Most of the sediment is derived by the erosion of the Pleistocene basement during recession of the barriers, but tide-induced cross-shore transport from the North Sea forms an additional source for the barriers and back-barriers of the west-facing coast of the Netherlands.

AB  - <jats:p>Purpose. The paper is aimed at investigating the propagation of solitons in a shallow basin, assessing the nonlinear effects resulting from the wave run-up on a gentle coast, and at comparing the estimates obtained using different numerical models with the available analytical dependencies. Methods and Results. The results of numerical simulations carried out using two nonlinear models of long waves (the author's model and the Simulating WAves till SHore (SWASH) one) are represented in the paper. The solitary wave profiles were obtained during its propagation in the part of a basin with constant depth conjugated with the inclined bottom. The process of a wave run-up on the coast was simulated using the algorithm of fluid movement along a dry coast. It is shown that when a soliton propagates in the basin part with constant depth, the nonlinearity effects are manifested in deformation of a wave profile. In other words, increase of the wave initial amplitude and the distance traveled by a wave is accompanied by growth of the wave front slope steepness. This, in its turn, leads to increase of a splash when the waves run-up on the coast. The estimates of the run-up heights resulted from different numerical models are in good agreement. Conclusions. The calculated values of the maximum wave run-up on the coast for the non-deformed waves, the length of which is equal to that of the traversed path, are close to the estimates obtained analytically. For the waves with the deformed profile, the front slope steepness of which increases with propagation over long distances, the run-up heights increase with growth of the wave initial amplitude. In such a case, it is desirable to replace the analytical estimates with the numerical ones. The run-up height of the deformed waves can exceed the wave initial amplitude by four or more times. The results obtained in this study can be useful in projecting the coastal protection constructions with the regard for preserving the coastal ecology and economy.</jats:p>

AB  - Background. The structure of benthic diatom assemblages (diversity, equitability, dominance) may be useful in assessing their ecological status in natural protected areas. Goals. To describe the structure of epipelic diatom assemblages from Laguna Guerrero Negro (LGN), a protected coastal lagoon, and test the hypothesis that Hdiversity values would be higher for diatom assemblages in LGN sediments than in typical benthic diatom assemblages. Methods. Sediment samples were collected in the lagoon on November 2013, and January, March, and July 2014. Diatoms were mounted on permanent slides and examined at 1000× using phase contrast microscopy. In each slide, 500 valves were counted to compute relative abundances of each taxon, and species diversity, equitability, and dominance, using Shannon (H), Pielou (J), and Simpson (λ) indices, respectively. Likewise, similarity between samples was measured. The calculated median value of H from LGN was compared to previously recorded median values to test the hypothesis that significant differences exist. Results. A total 225 diatom taxa were counted. With few exceptions, the similarity between samples was <60%. Relative abundances depict typical benthic diatom assemblages, with an average H= 4.96 bits/taxon, and corresponding values of equitability and dominance. The median value of H (Md = 4.9) was significantly higher than the median value (Md = 3.7) found in previous studies. Conclusions. The structure of the epipelic diatom assemblages from LGN and their patchy distribution are similar to that of typical diatom assemblages, but with unusually high values of H that lead us to reject the statistical null hypothesis and thus sustain our research hypothesis. © 2017 Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of marshes on simulated waves as an extension of the Louisiana Joint Storm Surge (JSS) modeling study that included wind modeling, Gulf of Mexico- and regional-scale wave modeling, surge modeling, and nearshore wave modeling. The modeling system included one-way and, for nearshore waves and surge, two-way interactions between the models. Simulations conducted for this study apply the methods developed within the Louisiana JSS study with a focus on marsh vegetation (bottom friction coefficients) and topography in the Caernarvon Marsh of coastal Louisiana. Evaluation of the local wave height for selected storms simulations with varying marsh parameters provides insight to the importance of limiting marsh loss and qualitative assessment of potential management alternatives. STWAVE simulations indicate that including bottom friction energy dissipation can significantly reduce the wave energy for the conditions tested in the study. Analysis of wave parameters and spectra at various locations in the study marsh highlight the effect of the bottom dissipation on wave energy.

AB  - The Antarctic region includes the continent and surrounding sea south of the Antarctic Convergence, where cold Antarctic upper water sinks and mixes with warmer sub-Antarctic water. The continent, nearly centered on the south geographic pole, is isolated from other land masses by the Southern Ocean. The continent's mean elevation is similar to 2000 m, and 98% of the surface is mantled by similar to 2000 m of glacial ice, which flows toward coastal outlets to the sea. The ice sheet is pierced by mountain summits, some approaching altitudes near 5000 m. The continental shelf mean width is 30 km. On its seaward edge, the shelf is at depths of 400-600 m. The total area of ice and snow surface presented by the region is doubled by the maximum extent of sea ice each year. The Antarctic continent is the principal heat sink of the world weather machine. Upwelling areas of the Southern Ocean recycle nutrients and stimulate the marine ecosystem, and seasonal changes in extent of sea ice contribute to one of the greatest annual pulses in marine organic production. The fish fauna have only 120 species, but these belong to 29 families. The zooplankton is rich in several endemic crustacea, notably the Antarctic krill. The only vertebrates on land come from the sea onto shore areas and fast ice, including colonies of breeding penguins and associated birds and seals. Closed communities of vascular plants and cryptogams occur on sub-Antarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula; but in the entire continental Antarctic, the vegetation is desertlike, composed of scattered mosses, lichens, and terrestrial algae. Exposed surfaces of crystalline rocks harbor endolithic microbial life, and a few species of invertebrates dwell on favorably exposed soil and under rocks. The ice plateau is as nearly abiotic or sterile as any area on the Earth's surface. The physical and biotic features of Antarctica represent extreme conditions. The continent was untouched by man until the past two centuries and remains nearly pristine. It yields key information concerning cold environments and global environmental systems, including evidence of change, and deserves protection from unnecessary disturbance.

AB  - Techniques for revegetation of foredunes in New Zealand were investigated using three indigenous sand-binding species: pingao, spinifex and sand tussock. Emphasis was placed on the development of guidelines from research trials designed to investigate the rehabilitation of dunes by planting nursery-raised seedlings. The aim was to promote successful techniques that will be of use to coastal managers and community-based interest groups such as Beach Care and Coast Care. Seed characteristics and methods for collection/preparation of seed are described. Pingao and sand tussock seedlings can be raised in large numbers in a nursery. Difficulties in raising spinifex seedlings at reasonable cost arise from low plant vigour and high mortality. Although transplanting of stolons and direct field seeding of spinifex are used successfully for management-scale restoration of sand dunes in New South Wales, trials in New Zealand have shown low survival rates from transplanted stolons and poor germination and growth after direct seeding. Nursery-raised seedlings of all three species established successfully in trials in several North Island coastal areas and along the beaches near Christchurch. The most favourable planting site for sand-binders was the seaward face of the mobile foredune just above high water level, providing that only moderate sand accumulation is expected. Plant growth was significantly increased by the application of a slow-release fertiliser (Magamp) at time of planting in trials on the less exposed beaches of the eastern North Island. More active sand movement on the west coast of the North Island and along the Christchurch beaches was thought to increase nutrient supply to planted seedlings, but may cause high mortality at exposed sites by burying plants. Because nursery-raised seedlings and planting-out are both expensive, consideration should be given to the alternative strategy of enhancing existing populations of sand-binding species. In either case the plants will require protection from human and animal activity. In the coastal environment, setbacks due to excessive sand accretion or erosion associated with storm events must be expected and should be rectified as soon as possible. The development of a frontal dune with a continuous cover of vigorous sandbinding vegetation is seen as an achievable objective in coastal areas with a high amenity value. The most desirable end-result for the foredune habitat would be a self-sustaining ecosystem based on indigenous species. © September 1999, Department of Conservation.

AB  - Biodeposits from farmed mussels severely influence the biogeochemistry of sediments by increasing the levels of organic matter (OM). Mitigation of such negative impacts is important for the development of sustainable aquaculture operations. As a step towards developing methods for remediation of coastal sediments affected by mussel farming, the effects of the polychaete, Hediste diversicolor was evaluated experimentally. In a series of field‐ and laboratory experiments we tested hypotheses about the effects of polychaetes on sediment oxygen consumption, nutrient fluxes and sulphide pools under different polychaete densities and sedimentation regimes. The experimental results support the idea that polychaetes can mitigate negative effects on the benthic environment beneath mussel farms. H. diversicolor oxidized the sediment and generally enhanced the oxygen consumption, and thus the decomposition of OM. The accumulation of pore water sulphides were reduced and fluxes of nutrients across the sediment‐water interface increased. Additional calculations suggest that the effects of polychaetes were mainly indirect and driven by increased microbial activity due to the borrowing activity of the polychaetes. Trends of increasing decomposition with increasing polychaete density suggest that the decomposition could be further enhanced by higher densities. Overall, we concluded that H. diversicolor is a potentially strong candidate for remediation of mussel farm sediments. The results show that sediments inhabited by H. diversicolor have high assimilative capacity of OM and oxygen conditions are significantly improved following the addition of polychaetes at naturally occurring densities. However, technological developments are needed in order to allow the approach to be used in practice.

AB  - Anticipated acceleration of sea level rise in combination with expected higher set-up of storm surges will require strengthening of coastal protection structures. Therefore a research project was started to quantify the resistance of the dyke body depending on the detailed hydrodynamic loads. For the evaluation of the hydrodynamic loads the mathematical model OTT-1d from HR Wallingford is chosen which has been modified by the Coastal Research Station with respect to real world conditions. The verification was done on the basis of distinct wave flume tests and recently by comparison with prototype measurements. In Petten in the Netherlands a large measurement site is operational to monitor waves and wave run-up. In 2006 the measurement site was extended by an overtopping device. The first data sets are used here to validate the model OTT-1d. Measured data of four storm surges are compared with the calculated ones to verify the generality of the model.

AB  - The construction of the James Bay hydroelectric power project in subarctic Canada started in 1972, but environmental information that would permit mitigation measures did not become available until about 1975. It is suggested that this pattern may be characteristic of large-scale development projects in remote areas where the time lags involved in obtaining environmental data, beyond the simply descriptive information, are such that engineering plans would proceed, for economic reasons, without such environmental data as a planning input. Some environmental and social impact case studies are presented in this paper with regard to the LaGrande Complex phase of the James Bay development. The environmental impact case study involves the subsystem of estuarine fisheries and the effect on it of changes in the flow regime of the LaGrande River, the relocation of the first dam (LG-1) on the LaGrande, saltwater encroachment up the river during the filling of the second dam (LG-2), and the changes in the thermal regime of the river. The social impact case study examines the effect of the road network associated with the hydro development, on the land tenure system of the native Cree Indians of the area. The behavior of developers, as they optimize their engineeringmore » plans over the years to develop as much power as is feasible, is contrasted with the behavior of the organizations representing the native peopleof the area, first opposing the project but later giving up the aboriginal title to the land in exchange for some legally recognized rights, and subsequently making additional concessions from their established rights in exchange for various community benefits. It is argued that this process has been resulting in an incremental erosion of the land and resource base of the Cree Indian people.« less

AB  - The authors examined the linkage between climate and interspecific plant interactions in New England salt marshes. Because harsh edaphic conditions in marshes can be ameliorated by neighboring plants, plant neighbors can have net competitive or facilitative interactions, depending on ambient physical stresses. In particular, high soil salinities, which are largely controlled by solar radiation and the evaporation of marsh porewater, can be ameliorated by plant neighbors under stressful conditions leading to facilitative interactions. Under less stressful edaphic conditions, these same neighbors may be competitors. In this paper, they use this mechanistic understanding of marsh plant interactions to examine the hypothesis that latitudinal and inter-annual variation in climate can influence the nature and strength of marsh plant species interactions. They quantified the relationship between climate and species interactions by transplanting marsh plants into ambient vegetation and unvegetated bare patches at sites north and south of Cape Cod, a major biogeographic barrier on the east coast of North America. The authors hypothesized that the cooler climate north of Cape Cod would lead to fewer positive interactions among marsh plants. The authors found both latitudinal and inter-annual variation in the neighbor relations of marsh plants that paralleled latitudinal differences in temperature and salinity. South of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions tended to be more facilitative, whereas north of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions were more competitive. At all sites, soil salinity increased and plant neighbor interactions were more facilitative in warmer versus cooler years. The authors results show that interspecific interactions can be strikingly linked to climate, but also reveal that because the sensitivity of specific species interactions to climatic variation is highly variable, predicting how entire communities will respond to climate change will be difficult, even in relatively simple, well- studied systems.

AB  - The agar shake technique has been tested for the enumeration and isolation of bacteria involved in the anaerobic oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds. High numbers of colony forming units were observed from regions rich in sulphide, and the numbers of these forms were sometimes significantly correlated with the number of sulphate-reducing bacteria. The isolates could oxidise not only thiosulphate but also sulphide in liquid medium at the expense of nitrate. Addition of 1 mM glucose to the medium enhanced the rate and amount of thiosulphate oxidised by many of the isolates. Hence the use of the agar shake technique is recommended for the study of these little known facultatively or even obligately chemolithotrophic bacteria involved in the anaerobic oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds in the marine and estuarine environment. © 1989.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage Conference Start Date: 2017, Sept. 18 Conference End Date: 2017, Sept. 21 Conference Location: Anchorage, AK, USA This research aims to develop a concrete-like material for underwater construction applications by using fluorogypsum (FG, an industrial by-product of hydrofluoric acid production), class C fly ash, and type II Portland cement. Two Response Surface Models (RSMs) were derived based on compressive strength tests and expansion measurements on FG-based blend cylindrical samples after 28-day curing. The developed RSMs allow accurate prediction of the compressive strength and volumetric expansion as functions of the relative content in weight of different components in the FG-based blend material. Using these RSMs, a composition with promising strength and durability properties was identified. Additional mechanical and physical properties that are significant for structural applications were also investigated experimentally for this composition, confirming that the select composition could be a promising substitute for ordinary concrete and/or limestone. The effects of environmental actions on the mechanical and durability properties of the FG-based blend were investigated by immersing samples in seawater for a period of one year. The results of this experimental investigation suggest that the developed FG-based blend is a promising material for underwater applications (e.g., as oyster cultch) and coastal protection structures (e.g., for the construction of artificial reefs and breakwaters), at a significantly lower cost than other materials commonly used for the construction of these structures. Additionally, the unit weight of the proposed material is significantly lower than that of ordinary concrete and limestone, which contributes to a longer life span of the underwater structure by reducing its sinking rate into the soft soil typically found, e.g., in the US Gulf Coast region.

AB  - Hemlock dwarf mistletoe ( Arceuthobium tsugense ), a parasitic seed plant, is endemic and common in coastal western hemlock forests from northern California to southern Alaska. The mistletoe spreads by seeds dispersed from residual to nearby trees. Over time, infestations can significantly reduce tree growth. Annual growth losses attributed to mistletoe infection are estimated at over 1 million m3 in coastal British Columbia. Variable retention silviculture regimes recently implemented in hemlock-dominated coastal forests create conditions that could exacerbate the spread, intensification, and effects of mistletoe. The Stand Establishment Decision Aid ( SEDA ) format has been used to extend information on various vegetation and forest health concerns in British Columbia. This is the second SEDA produced for the Coast Forest Region. It summarizes information that relates current management regimes to the spread and effects of hemlock dwarf mistletoe. The first page provides general information, hazard ratings for the biogeoclimatic zones and subzones of the Coast Forest Region, and silvicultural considerations for hemlock dwarf mistletoe. The second page outlines the growth and yield implications and other effects and associations of the pathogen. This page also includes a valuable resource and reference list to provide readers with more detailed information.

AB  - Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is increasingly being promoted as a cost-effective means of adaptation to climate change. However, in spite of considerable international press, there is still little evidence to substantiate this claim. This study proposes a method through which the cost-effectiveness of EbA strategies can be evaluated against alternative adaptation options, and contributes to South African literature on the subject. The potential cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration is assessed as a means of securing the carrying capacity of land for pastoralist communities of the Kamiesberg communal area in South Africa under projected future climate conditions. The conventional alternatives would be to respond to increasingly dry conditions by drilling boreholes and using supplemental feed for livestock. It was assumed that the EbA interventions would occur upfront, whereas the alternatives are more likely to be implemented in reaction to droughts over a longer time period. The study found the implementation of conventional alternatives to be more cost-effective than EbA as a means to sustaining livestock stocking rates, with EbA being twice as costly. However, this is framed from the perspective of those directly affected (the landowners), and does not include the benefits to broader society. © 2016, University of Pretoria. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In Florida, human alteration of coastlines has led to large-scale degradation of coastal ecosystems, including oyster reefs, beach dunes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes. Alteration of those habitats leads to the loss of associated ecosystem services, which are defined as "the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems" (MEA 2005) and include both products such as food and timber products and processes like coastal protection and disease control. Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed while repairing critical ecosystem structure and function in degraded systems and re-establishing the valuable services provided by these ecosystems (Montoya, Rogers, and Memmot 2012; Normile 2010). While ongoing restoration efforts aim to enhance degraded ecosystems, restoration has not always been a priority for coastal management. Indeed, Florida's history consists of widespread coastal development at the expense of the natural environment (Lewis et al 1999; Santschi et al. 2001).

AB  - The XBeach model has been applied for different field sites, each having its specific problems. Cases were ranging from typical 1D beach erosion tests during storm conditions (to compare with Durosta results) which were extended to full 2D models to include the effects of curved coasts. For these kind of applications the XBeach model proved to be at least as good as Durosta for the 1D cases, but also giving the opportunity to include the 2D effects. Other examples are situated on high energy coasts (with long swell waves). Applications there are for example the design of a new coastal protection scheme, but also the study of sedimentation patterns in a shallow harbour surrounded by breakwaters and beaches. XBeach proved to be a powerful tool to get insight into these complex situations.

AB  - The mesotidal coast of Huelva (S.W. Spain) is a tide-dominated (mixed energy) coastline type. This littoral zone is subject to a warm-temperate climate. Tidal regime is both mesotidal and semidiurnal with a slight diurnal inequality. The Piedras River mouth operates like an estuarine lagoon, where sediment supply is of dominantly marine provenance. Depositional facies along the inner estuary includes: (1) channel, (2) active channel margin, (3) salt marsh and (4) sterile marsh facies. All these facies are very similar to those described in other locations. Inner facies are asociated along the estuary mouth with spit facies and related environments: beach and dunes. Three stages in recent evolution of Piedras Estuary have been distinguished. The estuary-mouth morphology has evolved from a barrier-island system into an elongated spit accretion due to a decrease of the tidal prism. Two processes have changed the tidal prism: (1) estuary tilling and (2) dam construction.

AB  - Classic descriptive models of barrier sedimentation have been developed with data from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. These models are dominated by low to moderate rates of relative sea level (RSL) rise and wave energy. Barriers respond by landward recycling of sediment through the mechanism of shoreface retreat. The Louisiana coast surrounding the Mississippi Delta is underlain by compacting deltaic muds which generate very rapid rates of RSL rise. The Louisiana coast experiences low wave energy punctuated by high energy tropical and extra tropical storm events. Barrier sediments accumulate from the erosion of deltaic headlands and undergo a transformation from subaerial barrier island systems to subaqueous shoals located on the inner shelf. Drumlins experience coastal erosion on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia and provide a sediment source for compartmented estuary mouth barriers. An ongoing, moderate rise of RSL results from the passage of a glacial forebulge. Wave energy is intermediate between Louisiana and N.S.W. and displays a seasonal pattern dominated by frequent winter storms. Coastal barrier sedimentation is episodic, consisting of a period of beach ridge progradation followed by barrier destruction and reestablishment further landward. The three contrasting sedimentary sequences found in examples from Louisiana, N.S.W. and Nova Scotia indicate that presently available sedimentation models from locations such as the middle Atlantic or Texas coasts of the United States may only represent well documented regional case studies. A true generalized coastal sedimentation model is required which can identify the parameters controlling vertical and horizontal translation of the depositional surface and provide relationships between these parameters which quantitatively predict the genesis, distribution and geometry of coastal sedimentary facies.

AB  - <jats:p><p>Larger and more devastating flood events are happening more frequently across the planet, but flooding is a natural occurrence for any river system. It is only due to human modification of the river system, through the removal of natural features and attempts at flood control, that creates flood hazards that cause damage to communities and ecosystems.  Kapiti Coast’s terrain consisted, pre 19th century, of a mixture of dense coastal forests and extensive wetlands. The landscape has and always will be prone to flooding. With the addition of the expressway to the region, making it easier to travel to and from the capital Wellington, it is expected that the population of Kapiti will grow. But biodiversity may get lost, and flooding may become increasingly more frequent. How might new settlers learn to live with flooding and the constant risk that every time it rains it may cause damage to their homes or businesses? Can there be other benefits to floodplain management, such as biodiversity and recreation?  The aim of this research is to investigate and develop strategies to aid in the settlement of floodplains so that biodiversity is improved, allowing people to live with floods and without the fear that flooding may cause damage. Specifically, the design-led research seeks to generate solutions that improve both flood awareness and flood protection along the Waikanae River. The design seeks to allow the river to express its own flow patterns, and then secondly, how settlement will work within that. It can then be a catalyst for settlement of floodplain areas along the edge of the river.  This thesis will explore how ecology, rehabilitation and natural flood protection can be employed amongst an expanding urban context to create a new way of thinking about our rivers and mitigating the ever pressing issue of flooding.</p></jats:p>

AB  - This paper illustrates a budget approach to investigate and manage littoral sediment for coastal defence within an integrated process system in west Dorset, England. The budget is quantified in terms of inputs, transfers, storage and outputs of sediment within a littoral cell. Complex, long established links are demonstrated between eroding cliff sediment sources and a sequence of pocket shingle beaches that they supply. Sediment inputs and subsequent transfers are found to be episodic so that the beaches naturally alternate between open and closed system states according to prevailing transport conditions. Interestingly, the major storm barrier of Chesil Beach is identified as the ultimate shingle sink. These results suggest that the beach did not simply develop as a product of the Holocene transgression as often envisioned, but until recently, it formed part of a larger natural process system with the periodic input of additional shingle from the west, derived from the erosion of massive unstable cliffs. However, several interventions have dislocated these natural linkages, unwittingly reinforcing the closed system states. In the absence of natural replenishment, the modified beaches are becoming increasingly sensitive to the continuing relative sea-level rise and storm activity that characterises this region. Attention is drawn to the need to establish such understanding prior to undertaking additional interventions. Details are provided of the ways in which this information has assisted in the control of beach mining and future management policies are suggested.

AB  - The 'Working with Nature' philosophy (PIANC, 2011) was developed to apply to the planning of new navigation infrastructure projects. This case study illustrates how elements of the philosophy can be applied to ongoing activities such as maintenance dredging. For many years, most of the material dredged by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC) from the docks, river entrances and approach channel to the Port of Liverpool has been taken to an offshore licensed disposal site. Much of the remainder has been deposited closer to the Port, within the estuary. MDHC's maintenance dredging and disposal regime has been assessed and shown to be compliant with both the EU Habitats Directive and the EU Water Framework Directive. No adverse environmental effects have been identified. Notwithstanding this compliance, several factors including potential cost and carbon savings led to MDHC organising a stakeholder meeting at the end of 2011 to discuss whether opportunities might exist to use the maintenance dredged materials beneficially - whether for environmental or engineering purposes. This initiative represented significant departure from 'the norm' for MDHC who, in common with most other UK harbour authorities, have powers under their Local Act to carry out maintenance dredging, and regard such activities as 'internal' matters. It also represented a challenge for the stakeholder organisations as this was not a capital development project requiring compensation - a situtation in which such organisation often 'call the shot' - but rather a voluntary initiative, the success of which would depend on collaboration, cooperation and compromise. This paper elaborates on the background to, and presents progress to date with, the Mersey sediment management study as it moves from option identification and assessment to implementation - based on the principles of Working with Nature and adaptive management.

AB  - In England about 5 million properties are at risk of flooding. Socio-economic growth, rising sea levels and extreme weather will exacerbate this issue in the next 100 years. Building coastal resilience is vital worldwide to save people from the impact of flooding and the costs of damage and insurance. In Australia the use of mussel reefs and mangrove forests combined with man-made structures are being trialed to see how well they protect shorelines. Ways to measure the evolving effectiveness of nature-based hazard management are now required to determine the cost-benefit over various management epochs. Using capacitance-wire technology we have developed innovative systems to measure the required field data: overtopping, wave, water level and inundation conditions at the land-sea interface. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - Coral reefs provide critical ecological and geomorphic (e.g. sediment production for reef-fronted shoreline maintenance) services, which interact in complex and dynamic ways. These services are under threat from climate change, requiring dynamic modelling approaches that predict how reef systems will respond to different future climate scenarios. Carbonate budgets, which estimate net reef calcium carbonate production, provide a comprehensive `snap-shot' assessment of reef accretionary potential and reef stability. These budgets, however, were not intended to account for the full suite of processes that maintain coral reef services or to provide predictive capacity on longer timescales (decadal to centennial). To respond to the dual challenges of enhancing carbonate budget assessments and advancing their predictive capacity, we applied a novel model elicitation and review method to create a qualitative geo-ecological carbonate reef system model that links geomorphic, ecological and physical processes. Our approach conceptualizes relationships between net carbonate production, sediment transport and landform stability, and rates knowledge confidence to reveal major knowledge gaps and critical future research pathways. The model provides a blueprint for future coral reef research that aims to quantify net carbonate production and sediment dynamics, improving our capacity to predict responses of reefs and reef-fronted shorelines to future climate change.

AB  - Algal blooms are becoming increasingly common within the Chesapeake Bay. Nutrients entering the Bay, combined with optimal physical conditions and light, temperature and rainfall, contribute to the formation of these blooms. Certain types of phytoplankton (eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria) in these accumulations cause problems in local waters, including discolored water, noxious odors and taste, and poor food for zooplankton, benthos, and fish. Some are toxic and may also cause hypoxia/anoxia, with the low oxygen stressful to fish and other aquatic life. Submerged aquatic vegetation can also be adversely affected by the light-scattering cells. Because of increasing concern over the effects of algal blooms on organisms in Chesapeake Bay, laboratory studies were undertaken to examine the potential for removal of phytoplankton from the water column by the addition of kaolin clay as clay has been successfully used in Asia to remove established blooms. Three bloom-forming. phytoplanktors were used as test organisms: Prorocentrum minimum, a dinoflagellate common to the Bay which often forms large mahogany tides and can cause oyster mortality; Chattonella subsalsa, a rhaphidophyte observed in the coastal bays of Maryland and Delaware that has been associated with fish kills due to resulting low dissolved oxygen; and a small cyanobacterium from the Patuxent River similar to bloom species in nutrient-rich tributaries of the Bay. The experiments compared phytoplankton in media with and without clay slurry additions. In vivo fluorescence (IVF), an indicator of the amount of the plant pigment chlorophyll present, was measured on each of 4 replicates for each phytoplankton taxon (control and treated) before clay additions, 2.5 hours after clay addition, and 4 days later. Results showed a significant decrease in IVF in all clay treatments. Largest reductions in IVF were noted in Prorocentrum and Chattonella (99% and 92%, respectively). Single factor ANOVA indicated that significant decreases (p < 0.001) occurred after the initial 2.5 hour incubation period. Four days later, there was no further decline in WIT (p > 0.05). For the cyanobacterium, two experiments were conducted, one with very high densities typical of laboratory cultures, and a second with lower levels closer to those found in summer Chesapeake Bay waters. At 2.5 hours and 4 days, the IVF of the clay-treated cyanobacterium had decreased significantly (p < 0.001). These results indicate the almost complete aggregation and removal of Prorocentrum and Chattonella from the water column with the added clay while the cyanobactium (initially > 100 times more dense) remained in suspension longer and was removed by flocculation with the clay through time. The results of the current study suggest that the use of clays in controlling algal blooms looks promising for routine use in many estuaries. As clays are important and common constituents of most soils in coastal plains adjacent to these systems, the control material could be readily available in most basins for routine stripping of phytoplankton blooms from surface waters. Future work includes examination of natural soils as an efficient strategy for inexpensive control of recurring blooms in the Chesapeake Bay and nearby coastal bays.

AB  - It is common for the local sea state in coastal waters to be a complex combination of waves due to local and recent wind (the “sea”) and long period waves resulting from earlier weather systems, which have travelled many 100s of km with little attenuation of these very long waves (the “swell”). Sea and swell may have very different directions and periods (Fig. 1). (Figure presented.) The CrossOver project was born out of the recognition that there is an absence of guidance on the influence of directionally bimodal (or bidirectional, or ‘crossing’) seas on wave overtopping at a coastal defence. Through a physical model study carried out in the Delta Basin, the “CrossOver” project is beginning to fill this gap in the knowledge. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - This paper analyses coastal erosion prevention measures carried out in Latvia. The foreseen global climate change impacts and the ever growing human load on the coastal areas along with the lack of erosion policy is bring up serious concern about safety and sustainability of Latvian coastline. Although no national policy regarding coastal erosion prevention is applied in Latvia, some coastal protection measures are applied by local municipalities and private landowners. There are in total around 34 coast protection structures on the coastline of Latvia. The protected area doesn't exceed 2 km in total. Most of the coastal defences are based on natural materials like greenery, stones and timber. There is no preliminary estimation of primary needs and mandatory funding for maintenance costs. The alternate criteria for economically based solution should be defined for long term period. Therefore, the principles of sustainable development require the using of economically based solution and criteria which shall be established in national level.

AB  - A method for the design and safety assessment of coastal protection structures along the German Baltic Sea coast is developed based on an estimation of extreme storm impacts. About 60 meteorological storm scenarios and the reconstructed wind fields of the reference storm event of 1872 were used to drive a hydrodynamic modelling system covering the entire Baltic Sea. Water levels and wave climates were determined along the entire German Baltic Sea coastline and high-resolution profile models were applied to estimate local morphological impacts and maximum wave run-up for all storms. Depending on the locally-relevant type of load, it is possible to compare the time series of energy impact or wave run-up between scenarios and the reference event and to determine the maximum load. This method permits both the design of new and the safety assessment of existing structures.

AB  - North American and northern European evidence suggests present infilling of estuaries with marine sediment as sea level has continued to rise. Along the New South Wales coast such infilling mainly has ended because sea levels have been stable since 6500 B.P. Bathymetric changes for the period 1868-1974 in three estuaries on the central coast of New South Wales show considerable contrast due to varying estuarine dynamics and sediment availability. Changes in Botany Bay have now stabilized or tended towards slight erosion (-1332-1547 cmSUP-3 /mSUP-2 /year) while changes within Port Jackson seaward of Bradley's Head (-7694 cmSUP-3 mSUP-2 /year) can be linked to dredging activities this century. In Broken Bay, substantial accretion has occurred at the ocean entrance (7684 cmSUP-3 /mSUP-2 /year) and around Brisk Bay (5430 cmSUP-3 MSUP-2 /year). The former accretion can be attributed to movement of sediment landward of the 20-m contour under waves characteristic of the present wave regime, and to availability of sediment from adjacent semi-compartmentalized beaches. Such sediment movement and reservoirs do not exist at nearly as large a scale at the mouths of the other two Sydney estuaries. The latter accretion is coincident with the boundaries of marine sand intrusion up the estuary and of fluvial transport seawards. Because bathymetric change in areas of Broken Bay affected by ocean swell can be linked to wave hydrodynamics, changes in the wave climate such as increased storminess can lead to general bottom erosion. Such changes can also exacerbate erosion within Port Jackson and Botany Bay.

AB  - In 2008, the authors investigated the performances of a coastal defense project to be built along the NW coast of Sicily. The intervention consists of shore parallel breakwaters armored with a relatively new eco-friendly system: ECOPODE. In that context the idea arose of conducting an exhaustive experimental investigation on the hydraulic response of these units, including wave run-up, wave overtopping, wave transmission and wave reflection observations. The latter has been performed in 2010 at the LInC Laboratory of University of Naples Federico II. In this paper, the results on wave run-up and reflection are presented and discussed.

AB  - A succession of continental red beds in the Paleogene Carroza Formation, northeastern Mexico, contains an assemblage of evaporite paleosols previously unknown in pre-Neogene strata that record the syndepositional exposure of nearby diapiric evaporite and a climatic shift to increasing aridity. Carroza red beds were deposited in an ephemeral braided-fluvial system in a high-accommodation setting. Paleosols developed in nearly all depositional settings, including channels, crevasse splays, and floodplains, and contain salic/natric, gypsic, baritic, and calcic horizons. Calcic paleosols are limited stratigraphically to the lowermost part of the formation in oyster-bearing estuarine strata and yield upsection to evaporitic paleosols, thus providing a record of increasingly arid conditions as the Paleogene marine shoreline shifted eastward, toward the Gulf of Mexico Basin. The increase in aridity reduced vegetation and residuum thickness on the exposed diapiric salt, consequently increasing the influx of evaporitic minerals into the basin, and driving the development of salic/natric, gypsic, and baritic horizons in all depositional environments. Evaporitic paleosols of the Carroza Formation have characteristics similar to soils forming today in climates with annual precipitation ranging from <80 mm/yr to as much as 450 mm/yr, in apparent conflict with estimates of subhumid to subtropical conditions from Carroza fossil leaf data. Because evaporitic paleosols are persistent throughout the Carroza section, we infer that a combination of spring-fed, high water tables, augmented by flood-basin inundation from high-discharge seasonal fluvial flood events sustained perennial woodlands, and sodium-caused clay dispersion created poor drainage in topographically low parts of a rapidly subsiding salt-withdrawal basin.

AB  - The technical problems of estimating the topographic height of a mangrove species or community are discussed. Transects normal to the seaward mangrove face were taken around the coast of Australia. They confirm that a stable margin will be approximately at mean sea level but that erosion, accretion or other disturbance may cause variation of the order of ±1 m. Studies in four species-rich rivers in north Queensland show that (i) there are marked distributional differences with respect to topographic height between long and short river estuaries, these differences being attributable to different tidal patterns; and (ii) there appear to be two mangrove types: the frontal species are tolerant of inundation, poorly adapted to emersion, whereas the upstream species behave as dry-land plants tolerant of only limited inundation. The topographic height range of individual plants of a single species may be almost 4 m, so that observations on individual plants are of little value.

AB  - Question: What are the effects of grazing abandonment on the vegetation composition of Estonian coastal wetlands? Location: Vormsi Island and Silma Nature Reserve in western Estonia, Europe. Methods: Local knowledge and field reconnaissance were used to identify current and historical management levels of wetland sites within the west Estonian study area. Nine study sites, with varying management histories, were selected comprising an area of 287 ha. A total of 198 quadrats were taken from 43 distinct vegetation patches in five of the sites. TWINSPAN analysis was used to identify community type, and a phytosociological key was constructed for character taxa. This vegetation classification was then applied within a GIS-based context to classify all the study sites, using a ground survey technique and 1:2000 scale air photos. Results: We identified 11 different brackish coastal wetland community types. Indicator species were defined with community characteristics for the seven main vegetation types readily recognisable in the field. Coastal wet grasslands were most extensive in grazed sites, or sites that had been more intensively grazed, while abandoned sites were largely composed of Phragmites australis stands, tall grassland, and scrub. Site variations based on vegetation composition were significantly correlated with past grazing intensity. Plant community types showed significant edaphic differences, with particularly low soil moisture and high conductivity and pH for open pioneer patches compared to other vegetation types. Conclusion: Abandonment of traditionally grazed coastal grasslands threatens their characteristic biodiversity. This study found that grazing abandonment reduced the extent of coastal wetland grasslands of particular conservation value. Nevertheless, plant species of conservation interest were found across the sequence of community types described. The study shows that grazing is an important factor influencing coastal wetland plant communities but suggests that vegetation distribution is affected by environmental variables, such as topography. Nomenclature: Stace (1999).

AB  - Since 1952 authorised releases of many fission products and transuranic radioisotopes, including 237Np, have been discharged into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield nuclear site. The radionuclides become attached, dependent on particle reactivity, to sedimentary particles and incorporated by sedimentary deposition and suspension processes into intertidal and estuarine environments resulting in the contamination of the surrounding environment. Parallel to the coastline is an area of fine-grain size dominated sediments commonly known as the ‘mud patch’ where sedimentary particles, with associated radionuclides, accumulate as a result of tidal movement and currents in the shallow Western Irish Sea basin. Particulates are redistributed and deposited onto the saltmarsh as a result of tidal processes and storm events. Ravenglass saltmarsh is a highly dynamic ecosystem situated in the mouth of the River Esk, 5 km from Sellafield site. Like other saltmarsh environments, sediment both rapidly accumulates and degrades due to perturbations in sea level and storm events retaining a chronological profile of radionuclide discharge history. Research has shown that the Ravenglass saltmarsh is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas within the Irish Sea due to the significant levels of radionuclides, accumulated during tidal processes. The developed method was used to analyse surface scrape samples taken over a twenty five year period and an intertidal marsh sediment core from Ravenglass saltmarsh to gain a greater understanding of the behaviour, distribution and mobility of 237Np in the environment. Surface scrape samples provide a pragmatic method of measuring sediment contamination over large areas. The approach is used by most routine environmental monitoring programs, with the results used to calculate dose transfer factors and ascertain risk of exposure to the general public. The samples indicate recent contamination and are used in this study to identify temporal and spatial distribution across the saltmarsh. Samples from across the saltmarsh were analysed for a range of radionuclides (106Ru, 137Cs, Pu alpha, 237Np and 241Am) at four time points over the twenty five years. The greatest rate of change was reported for 106Ru, 137Cs and 237Np followed by Pu alpha and 241Am with a number of factors influencing the rate of reduction with time such as radiological half-lives, decreasing discharges and remobilisation. Considerable spatial variation for the different radionuclides across the saltmarsh was also observed, which with time became less defined. The highest activity concentrations of long-lived radionuclides were in low energy areas, typically where higher rates of sedimentation and vegetation occurred. The trend was reversed for the shorter-lived radionuclide, 106Ru, with higher activity concentrations observed in high energy areas where there was frequent tidal inundation. The variation shows the importance of sampling from the exact same location for long term studies to ensure any changes in data are not an artefact of spatial variation but reflect temporal trends. The radionuclide profile of 237Np was determined in a sediment core taken from the saltmarsh which had a distinct geochemical redox profile. The core had been previously analysed for other radionuclides (137Cs, 241Am and Pu α) showed a chronological profile which had a strong correlation with published Sellafield discharge records indicating that the sediment was largely undisturbed. The highest activities of 237Np were in the upper sections of the profile with the presence of two minor peaks further down and activities decreasing to below the limit of detection at a depth of 21.5 cm. The profile was partially reconciled with the Sellafield effluent discharges however less defined than for other radionuclides. The lack of correlation was due to limited discharge data, increased 237Np activities in the upper sections and a differing profile distribution compared to the other transuranic nuclides possibly indicating redistribution of Np within th core. The distribution profile was consistent with other cores sampled at the Ravenglass saltmarsh which did not show redox zonation indicating 237Np is not redox sensitive in this environment. Comparison of nuclide ratios in the surface scrape and core concluded 237Np exhibited conservative behaviour, similar to 137Cs, and activities closely reflecting Sellafield discharges due to the lower affinity for inorganic particles. This was in contrast to Pu alpha which exhibited a higher affinity for inorganic particles becoming strongly associated with the fine grained sediment and exhibiting non-conservative behaviour with input sources originating from discharge and the mud patch with results reflecting both current and historic contamination. Such information is essential in assessing the long-term behaviour of 237Np in the environment, importance in radiological dose assessment and mobility and distribution in long term storage options such as geological disposal.

AB  - Previous research shows that storm surge episodes occur frequently at the mouth of the Tagus Estuary, causing important water level anomalies in Lisbon and Cascais tide gauge records and having important effects in coastal erosion. Atmospheric pressure is indicated as the main driver of storm surge events in the West Iberian Peninsula. However, the extent of the effect of atmospheric pressure induced surges on inner estuary water level, an important issue for the estuary management using hydrodynamic forecast systems, is still poorly known with tide gauge records analyses concentrating outside the estuary. In this work a set of tide gauge records, between October 1972 to January 1973, for 11 locations in the Tagus Estuary and adjacent coast and a numerical model of Tagus Estuary hydrodynamics (MOHID Water) are used to test the importance of large scale atmospheric pressure changes in explaining inner estuary non-tidal water level anomalies with period larger than 30 hours. The results of two model simulations, with and without the effect of atmospheric pressure considered according to the inverted barometer approximation based on atmospheric pressure reanalysis data, are contrasting with the tide gauge records. The research finds that the account of atmospheric pressure can reduce the importance of the model centered RMSE in 5-20% and improve considerably the model results correlation coefficient in the lower and middle estuary, particularly in low depth locations not directly affected by river discharges. These results suggest that these should be the estuarine locations more sensible to storm surges episodes.

AB  - The Philippine archipelago, which has one of the longest coastlines in the world, will not be spared of the adverse impacts of sea-level rise and extreme climate events that are expected to happen in a warmer world. This study aims to review climate change impacts on Philippine coastal communities and to set directions for possible adaptation measures on both local and national levels. The erratic changes in the climate system have affected various coastal ecosystem and communities. Among which coral bleaching, changes in productivity, changes in plankton dynamics, alterations in seagrass and sea weed reproduction patterns, shoreline erosion and retreat, changes in trophic dynamics as well as aggravation of marine diseases are just a few. Apparently, the most significant impact is on coastal fisheries yield and community welfare. Existing climate change initiatives in the country include Integrated Coastal Zone Management System (ICZM), coastal policies and regulations (e.g. Fisheries Code), disaster management strategies among others. However, there is lack of integration for these initiatives in the context of climate change. Several points were raised as suggestions and solutions. An improved network of strategies should be created and a multisectoral approach should be adapted. Macro and micro-tevel adaptation measures should be defined and evaluated to ensure effective dissemination and implementation. The national government embodies the authority for governance and policies. On the other hand, local government should focus on implementation in collaboration with the academe (technical support), non-government organizations (advocacy, information, education and communication), private, and financial institutions (financial assistance). Recent observations on climate change impacts are sufficient evidence to raise this issue as a national concern. Recognizing and accepting that climate is indeed altering the planet is crucial and a change of mindset should begin within us.

AB  - A simple framework to assess the potential implications of flooding in fetch-limited coastal environments (with no relevant wave setup), experiencing both coastal and river flooding, was recently developed. It identifies tide, storm surge, sea level rise and river discharge as the main sources of flooding hazards. The framework prioritizes site-based local management, and identifies alternative tools for sustainable coastal resources, to face non-desired flood effects. It was applied to a morphologically complex (tidal channels network, salt marshes, dunes) occupied backbarrier coastal stretch located in Culatra Island, South Portugal (max. fetch similar to 4 km). Several best practices principles and guidelines were proposed for the three risk zones, namely the adaptation to uses with 'added value', which enhances the local ecological values and strengths economic activities. This study contributes to the method validation at a complex morphological area and enriches the understanding about the potential of flood in fetch-limited conditions, praising the perspective of living with climate change.

AB  - Over the past half century, habitat changes have significantly affected production of northern pike (Esox lucius), especially in the Great Lakes Basin. Loss of wetlands, reduction of shoreline cover and structure, cultural eutrophication, and siltation have negatively affected water transparency, abundance of macrophyte habitat, and even body condition. We review recent habitat restoration programs conducted in the Great Lakes Basin to reverse this trend. However, assessment has usually been inadequate to evaluate their success. Spawning and nursery requirements (first year of life) are examined, using a system for classifying and ranking major physical characteristics and requirements. Depth of nursery habitat is directly correlated with fish size and age. Spawning habitat is usually less critical or limiting but more easily manipulated and restored than nursery or juvenile-adult habitats. Year-class strength over 22 yr in eastern Lake Ontario was correlated positively with midsummer temperature and negatively with late summer-early fall water elevation; also, the largest year-class appeared immediately after catastrophic winterkill of a predator, white perch (Morone americana). Both implicate nursery rather than spawning associations. Adult abundance is related to the extent of macrophyte cover, which is optimal from 35 to 80% but inversely related to body size.

AB  - Conference Title: 2018 4th International Conference on Universal Village (UV) Conference Start Date: 2018, Oct. 21 Conference End Date: 2018, Oct. 24 Conference Location: Boston, MA, USA The following article describes three case studies where Effective Microorganisms (EM) proved to be successful at recovering natural aquatic ecosystems as well as treating sewage and industrial waste water. The first case was at a water treatment plant that received the sewage water from two populated sectors of about 1’100,000 people within Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador. The efficacy of EM treatment was compared to an already established water treatment system using electrical aerators. In both cases, pH was maintained at a neutral range after 8 weeks and hydrogen sulfide, main cause of foul odors, was not detected after 5 weeks. The most significant difference was in the cost and used of energy. The second case consisted of treating the facilities of a slaughterhouse processing 1000 animals a day with the objective of reducing foul odors. EM was sprayed in all areas of the facility including floors, pathways, sewers and surrounding areas. Although no measurable parameters were evaluated, workers were interviewed to determine efficacy in reducing foul odors. After 5 months of treatment, employees and foremen agreed that foul odors were reduced almost completely to the point that employees did not feel the need to use masks. In addition, there was a consensus that the working conditions had significantly improved. The third case was the treatment of a natural estuary being contaminated with sewage water. Water samples and sediments were taken from the area receiving sewage water from the city sewage system. The following parameters were evaluated: Acidity, phosphates, organic matter, hydrogen sulfide, total suspended solids, populations of coliforms and salmonella. The results showed a significant decrease in phosphates, total suspended solids, organic matter and hydrogen sulfide, and a reduction in concentration of coliforms. Additionally, pH was maintained at neutral range allowing the proliferation of native life. These experiences demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of EM to mitigate water contamination due to human activities in populated cities.

AB  - At Lake Whangape, Lower Waikato River, New Zealand, almost 14 km of the 29 km shoreline supports turf communities during late summer/early autumn. A 1997 survey discerned 21 community types of turfs, comprising both indigenous and alien species. Most turfs were highly diverse—44 indigenous and 91 alien plant species were reported from an area of 800 m2 of shoreline. Many species were ephemeral, either facultative or obligate annuals, colonising exposed sediments and dying once submerged. The critically endangered grass Amphibromus fluitans, found during 1990, now appears to be extinct here. The lake supports the largest known population of the indigenous annual sedge Fimbristylis velata. Regionally important populations of Pratia perpusilla and Carex gaudichaudiana are present. Cattle grazing and grass-selective herbicides were investigated by constructing cattle exclosures and monitoring vegetation changes inside and outside, over three years. Dominant species were usually perennials, with the alien Mercer grass (Paspalum distichum) and the indigenous emergent spike sedge (Eleocharis acuta) most common. There was no change in the abundance of turf species. The grass-specific herbicide Gallant® successfully controlled Mercer grass for at least one year. Factors controlling the distribution and composition of the turfs were minimum lake level and timing of drawdown, wave exposure, and the grazing impacts of cattle, waterfowl, and coarse fish. Weedy alien plants were not considered current threats. Cattle access to the lake is detrimental to the whole lake system, reducing plant cover, and preventing establishment of a nutrient buffer of marginal/emergent vegetation. Actions for managing the turf communities include: lowering the existing outlet structure (sill) giving more exposed surface for summer turf development; fencing larger areas of turf against cattle access, or attempting to prevent cattle access to the entire shoreline; monitor impact of waterfowl grazing; control expansion of willows and other weeds; trial fish exclosures for the impact on turfs; attempt restoration of amphibious communities around Plot 4. © November 2001, Department of Conservation.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 813-815. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208. On the North Sea and Channel shores the Southeastern coast of England holds perhaps the record for the number of towns gobbled up during recent-historic-times. The relative level of the sea to the land has varied over the centuries: in the late Roman period, and again from about 1250 onwards. Protective dykes were constructed but were repeatedly destroyed by the sea. There were periods of accretion that resulted for instance in the creation of the salt marshes of Essex and the Wash. Once flourishing settlements on the eastern coast of England have been completely destroyed, some before, some during the Middle Ages. Some prospering settlements disappeared under the sea in the 14th century, when major flooding occurred several times, with the worst floods in the 15th century. The coast of Flanders-Belgian area and Netherlandish Zeeland-has been the theatre of both silting and erosion. The paper provides a review of physical changes, loss of land, and their economic consequences.

AB  - Abstract. Tidal salt marshes are known to accumulate “blue carbon” at high rates relative to their surface area, which render these systems among the Earth’s most efficient carbon (C) sinks. However, the potential for tidal salt marshes to mitigate global warming remains poorly constrained because of the lack of representative sampling of tidal marshes from around the globe, inadequate areal extent estimations, and inappropriate dating methods for accurately estimating C accumulation rates. Here we provide the first estimates of organic C storage and accumulation rates in salt marshes along the Pacific Coast of Canada, within the Clayoquot Sound UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, a region currently underrepresented in global compilations. Within the context of other sites from the Pacific Coast of North America, these young Clayoquot Sound marshes have relatively low C stocks but are accumulating C at rates that are higher than the global average, with pronounced differences between high and low marsh habitats. The average C stock calculated during the past 30 years is 54 ± 5 Mg C ha−1 (mean ± standard error), which accounts for 81 % of the C accumulated to the base of the marsh peat layer (67 ± 9 Mg C ha−1). The total C stock is just under one-third of previous global estimates of salt marsh C stocks, likely due to the shallow depth and young age of the marsh. In contrast, the average C accumulation rate (CAR) (184 ± 50 g C m−2 yr−1 to the base of the peat layer) is higher than both CARs from salt marshes along the Pacific coast (112 ± 12 g C m−2 yr−1) and global estimates (91 ± 7 g C m−2 yr−1). This difference was even more pronounced when we considered individual marsh zones: CARs were significantly greater in high marsh (303 ± 45 g C m−2 yr−1) compared to the low marsh sediments (63 ± 6 g C m−2 yr−1), an observation unique to Clayoquot Sound among NE Pacific Coast marsh studies. We attribute low CARs in the low marsh zones to shallow-rooting vegetation, reduced terrestrial sediment inputs, negative relative sea level rise in the region, and enhanced erosional processes. Per-hectare, CARs in Clayoquot Sound marsh soils are approximately 2–7 times greater than C uptake rates based on net ecosystem productivity in Canadian boreal forests, which highlights their potential importance as C reservoirs and the need to consider their C accumulation capacity as a climate mitigation co-benefit when conserving for other salt marsh ecosystem services.

AB  - The multidisciplinary research project "GIZCAM" coordinated several research axes in order to promote Integrated Coastal Zone Management. A simulation model of the Ile de Camargue (Rhone delta central area) hydrological functioning was developed, in particular for hydraulic crisis (river floods and sea storms) situation. This tool is based in particular on data generated by a GIS, whose implementation will lead to a control board of delta land use and coastal lagoon morphology recent evolution. The evolution of coastline and bathymetric profiles in most sensible areas were studied on a quantitative basis in relation with existing coastal defence structures and wave forcing. It was demonstrated that submarine erosion occur in front of frontal dykes, and coastal retreat downdrift of groynes, were no stabilisation occurred in 30 years. Pesticides fluxes were modelled at the scale of rice farm and an integrated hydrosystem pesticide transfer model developed and tested. A field experiment was conducted using radon radioactive natural gaz to quantify groundwater flux to the central lagoon. Hydro-saline and suspended material fluxes of sea lagoon surface exchanges were quantified. Empirical study was conducted, focusing on understanding actions, decision making processes, and their impact on the functioning of the water executive commission. A role-playing game based on companion modelling tool, was developed to assess negotiation processes while searching to establish sustainable management rules for coastal wetlands.Original Abstract: Le projet a propose la coordination de plusieurs axes de recherche ayant pour objectif de tendre vers la gestion integree de la zone cotiere. Il s'agissait de developper un modele de simulation du fonctionnement hydrologique de l'Ile de Camargue, de le rendre plus modulaire afin de pouvoir integrer de nouvelles options de gestion hydraulique, particulierement en conditions critiques (crues et surcotes marines). Cet outil s'appuie en particulier sur des donnees generees par un Systeme d'Information Geographique (SIG), qui permet la mise en place d'un tableau de bord de l'etat de l'occupation du sol et de l'evolution morphologique des etangs. L'evolution recente du trait de cote et des profils bathymetriques dans les secteurs les plus sensibles, en relation avec les amenagements de protection realises et le forcage par la houle, ont ete etudies sur une base quantitative permettant de mettre en evidence l'erosion sous marine devant les digues frontales et l'erosion en aval derive des epis, sans stabilisation sur 30 ans. Les transferts de pesticides utilises en riziculture, depuis l'entree sur le bassin versant ont ete modelise a l'echelle d'une exploitation, et un modele integre de transfert dans l'hydrosysteme a ete developpe et teste. Une experimentation de terrain a ete menee, basee sur les flux de radon gaz radioactif naturel, pour quantifier les apports d'eaux souterraines aux etangs. Les flux hydro-salins et de matiere en suspension de surface associes aux echanges de surface entre lagune et etangs ont ete quantifies. Une etude a ete menee, visant la comprehension des actions, processus decisionnels, de leur impact sur le fonctionnement de la commission executive de l'eau de l'Ile de Camargue. La modelisation d'accompagnement, orientee jeu de role a ete utilisee pour animer la reflexion dans la recherche d'un compromis dans la negociation sur les regles de gestion durable des zones humides littorales.

AB  - The "Ile de Camargue" is a complex hydrosystem, including agricultural drainage basins, marshes, and the brackish shallow Vaccares lagoon system. This hydrosystem is particularly affected by water management and its endykement from the river and the sea. Decrease of sediment river input to the coast and sea level rise contribute to a global erosion of the shoreline. Within the endyked hydrosystem, during the rice cultivation period, large amounts of water are pumped from the river for irrigation, generating important water and sediment fluxes. Hydrosystem modelling and multi-source data are used to derive the suspended sediment balance and salt stock dynamics. Current water management and climate forcing will make it impossible to manage efficiently both water levels and salinity in the delta. A more natural deltaic hydraulic functioning, which implies increased hydraulic connectivity with the river and sea appears to be the only sustainable way in the long term.

Remote sensing satellite imagery provides valuable information for mangrove mapping and monitoring. In this study, we use high resolution images from SPOT-5, Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 satellites to perform change detection on an area of interest that covers the mangrove forests at the Ramsar sites of Pulau Kukup, Tanjung Piai and Sungai Pulai in the southwestern part of Johor State of Malaysia. Land use/land cover maps and the mangrove change map are generated to identify the mangrove distribution and temporal variation between 2000 and 2016. A hierarchical object-based classification method was used to produce the land use/land cover map in 2000, 2005, 2013 and 2016. The WorldView2 data were also used for validation of the classification results. This study presented an approach for mangrove mapping and change detection analysis. The map provides an up to date information for the study area and can be used for future comparative study.

AB  - Saltmarsh grasses and mangrove trees have been recognized for their function in wave and current attenuation, which is fundamental in coastal protection with nature. In this study, we conducted in situ measurements on hydrodynamic mediation by three typical species of intertidal plants within three estuaries located in Southeast China, in order to examine the relative efficiency of different plants in protecting the coasts. Our field observations reveal that Scirpus mariqueter shows better efficiency than Spartina alterniflora in resistance to hydrodynamic forces, and the latter one is better than Kandelia obovate in protecting coasts.

AB  - Qiantang bore as well as the storm surge are great disasters for river bank protection at the estuary of Qiantang River. Pearl River estuary is also frequently attacked by strong typhoon storm surge. The risk of damage from storm surge is expected to increase in both estuaries, exacerbated by sea level rise (SLR) and possible climate-induced increases in typhoon intensity and frequency. Adequate estimation on extreme water level will be essential to the coastal flood mitigation for both estuary areas with the effect of climate change. In this study, the popular frequency models Weibull, Lognormal, Gumbel, P-III and GEV are compared on Ganpu station located at the estuary of Qiantang River and Denglongshan station in Guangdong province, the optimal GEV model is recommended. For the risky analysis and management concern induced by the shortage of studied data, the estimated 50 year and 100 year extreme water levels respectively at Ganpu and Denglongshan stations are recommended in this study. Both studied stations located at different estuaries are all type II GEV model as the parameter of GEV distribution are higher than 0. The difference of the parameter and the reason causes the difference in the studied stations are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Furthermore, with the estimated 2.9nnn/yr SLR by sea level bulletin of China, effect of SLR in frequency analysis on Denglongshan station is discussed.

AB  - A comparative study at the global scale of ecological engineering techniques suitable for coral reef restoration. To limit the impact of development projects on the decline of coral ecosystem while following a trend already started in Europe and in the world; the French regulation has, since 2009, made obligatory the establishment of initiatives to offset the impacts caused to the environment. Artificial reefs and coral transplantation (or both together) are the two tools providing the most positive experience feedbacks worldwide. The study and comparison of 22 restoration projects of coral reefs conducted worldwide has shown that since the new regulatory obligations of mitigation, European projects have been multiplied, trying to find more effective techniques at lower costs. However, despite undeniable advances in applied research on the effectiveness of ecological engineering techniques used in experimental conditions, there is still no standard methodology of evaluation for each case of their application, in the context of mitigation measures for environmental impacts. This methodological gap often results in a gap between the "scientific" and the "practical" restorations and by frequent disagreement on the best practices for evaluation.

AB  - ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to present and evaluate the rate of biomass growth due to temperature changes and to identify the type of vegetation that best adapts to temperature changes in a surface flow constructed wetland (CW). The operation of the CW started in 2009 treating stream agricultural runoff from a watershed area of 221 ha which are mainly wet paddy fields. The CW is composed of seven connected cells which include a sedimentation zone, deep and shallow marshes. Five typical wetland plant species such as Acorus calamus, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites australis, Phragmites japonica, and Typha orientalis were planted surrounding the CW. The water quality and plant biomass were monitored from April to December 2009. The mean inflow DO and pH concentration were 6.9 ± 2.0 mg/l and 7.0 ± 0.5, respectively during the whole season. The water and air temperature at the CW were not significantly different (Ta = 0.86Taw; n = 15; r = 0.91; p <0.0001). Based on the results, the optimum temperatu...

AB  - Forestation on the coastal dunes has been regarded as one of the best programs that help to stabilize the dune landscapes and protect the residential area from strong winds, blown sands, and salt spray. Introducing exotic species for dune stabilization was very common in the past. However, it could deprive coastal land of its ability to naturally recover, causing a retreat of coastline as well. As a typhoon passed through the Korean Peninsula early September in 2010, coastal dunes along the west coast of the peninsula were severely damaged during the storm. Some dunes retreated landward more after erosion, while others recovered their original profile through aeolian transport processes mainly in winter season. Vegetated dunes with pine trees recovered relatively less after the erosion than grass-covered dunes. Planting pine trees may interfere in these interactions, weakening natural recuperative power. We compared the characteristics of wind environment, morphology, and vegetation between the grass-covered dunes and the dunes covered with pine trees, for the purpose of the effectiveness of planting trees on dunes. The pine forest decreases the wind velocity on the front side of the dune to less than 50% of the grass-covered dune. Especially, the velocity of the strong winds faster than 4.5 m/s diminished to 25% of the control sites, resulting in decreased blown sand supply. Flora is also changed in the forested area. Terrestrial plants have invaded after pines were planted. In contrast, natural flora gets disappeared after the introduction of alien and exotic species. This study suggests that planting tree is likely to lead negative impact on coastal dunes. It may result in a retreat of coastline, loss of land, and devastation of dune ecosystems. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - With the emergence of the so-called Blue Economy, various conservation finance mechanisms and financial structures are being proposed as a means of simultaneously securing marine biodiversity and profit-making. A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance. While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits – ultimately rents – to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live.

AB  - A storm surge barrier is planned to build at the entrance of the North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary for various purposes, e.g. preventions of extreme high water level due to storm and salt intrusion in dry season. A process-based model of the Yangtze Estuary is elaborated to simulate water levels during typhoon period with the storm surge barrier included in the model as hydraulic structure. Scenarios for different storm surge barrier width are examined by the model. By applying real time control method, the storm surge barrier operation, such as gate opening and closing, is also implemented in the model. The simulated high water level during typhoon Winnie (9711) period with different opening width are compared with the reference case, i.e. without barrier, and the observation data. The width of 3km is recommended based on the largest reduction of extreme high water level. The optimal operation program during typhoon period is recommended.

AB  - A multi-objective, comprehensive technical evaluation was conducted in close coordination and consultation with state and other federal agencies to determine the nature and level of hurricane protection and environmental restoration that lines of defense provide for coastal Mississippi. The definition of "lines of defense" in this context means ways of protecting coastal Mississippi from hurricane inundation. The intended approach was to investigate plans and designs that provide increased hurricane protection for the Mississippi Gulf Coast as well as avoid and minimize unintended consequences of taking such actions. This paper focuses on the development of state-of-the-art atmospheric and coastal ocean hydrodynamic analysis methods that were used to determine the hurricane storm surge hazard along the Gulf Coast. These methods were developed as part of the Joint Coastal Surge Analysis Study in which the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency defined a unified technical approach to determine 100-yr storm water surface elevations across the region. Although other lines of defense were evaluated, the purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of flood protection structures on storm surge for storms of varying intensities and changes to the 100-yr flood elevations with flood walls in place. Nearly 200 synthetic storms were selected for simulation of the existing conditions along the Mississippi coast. Surge levels produced from these simulations populated the Joint Probability Method with Optimal Sampling (JPM-OS) surge response space and stage frequency curves were developed for 80 locations. By examining the actual surge responses from the simulated storms at a given location, the rank (which can be converted to return period) of the surge produced by each storm at that location was determined from the stage frequency curve. In this way, the range of return periods simulated for existing conditions could be covered for with-project (line of defense) conditions by applying the modeling system to a small subset of storms that span the full range of return periods, thus providing an efficient means to evaluate the lines of defense. The goal of this paper is to present an application of the JPM-OS by demonstrating how the Mississippi coast responds to different storms with and without lines of defense in place and how the lines of defense change stage frequency curves.

AB  - <abstract language="eng">Observations in a mangrove lined coast in south-western Puerto Rico (rainfall 800-1,000 mm; evaporation 1,900-2,200 mm; mean annual temperature 25º C; and average tidal range 0.3 m) have shown that the degree of structural development of the mangrove forest is closely related to wave exposure. In exposed coastal segments, sand berms formed by wave action within the outer fringe prevent water flow towards the inner forest, resulting in high salinities. The berms are higher in areas where the outer mangrove fringe has been destroyed by storms or other causes. Dead mangrove stands are found behind these areas and salinities reach 75-80‰ We suggest that the mangrove fringe contributes to dissipate wave energy over a broad area which reduces the high of the berm. The presence of absence of "blowholes" in the seagrass Thalassia; bed is an index of the degree of protection that the coast receives. The "thickness" of the mangrove fringe is also related to the degree of shelter: it is "thin" in high energy segments, "thick" in coastal segments subject to intermediate energy and "thin"again in the most sheltered locations. In the outlying cays mangrove development follows a similar pattern: the outer exposed cays (essentially coral islands mantled by coarse sands) are devoid of mangrove cover or have stunted trees (generally Laguncularia; canopy height, 2 m). Islands which are less exposed are colonized by Rhizophora which frequently forms overwashed forests (canopy height, 8-9 m). In the most seltered areas, Rhizophora colonizes the shallow banks, forming islands which soon develop an inner hypersaline lagoon due to the accumulation of material in the outer edges and the accumulation of salt in the interior. The wave energy level reaching a given section of the coast is therefore an important factor which determines the degree of structural development of the mangrove forest. High energy levels are associated with erosion, destruction or deposition of berms which affect mangrove development. Low energy levels, however, are associated with a rapid process of island maturation, aging and death due to rapid salt accumulation

AB  - At present, the entire Romanian shore of the Black Sea is intensely and continously damaged by sea erosion, on about 60-70 % of the shore length. The shoreline has moved onshore, on variable distances from an area to another, with values of up to tens meters, existing the risk to damage even the littoral bands. The erosion intensification is caused by the desechilibrium created by natural and artificial causes, between the quantity of available sediment in the littoral area, and the energy of waves and sea currents. In the last 5 decades, more than 50 breakwaters for beach protection have been realized in the area between Mangalia and Midia Head, especially in the areas of touristic importance, refering to the development of the littoral cities. Analysing these works, conclusions can be derived in order to improve their efficiency. For the littoral protection it is necessary to elaborate a program for stopping the shore erosions.

AB  - ABSTRACT CIPRIANI, L.E., FERRI, S., LAMI, G and PRANZINI, E., 2011. Human Impact on Shoreline Evolution Along the Follonica Gulf (Southern Tuscany): How Tourism May Kill the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs. In: Micallef, A. (ed.), MCRR3-2010 Conference Proceedings, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue, No. 61, pp. 290–294. Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy, ISSN 0749-0208. Follonica Gulf beach is subject to widespread low-rate erosion, which started in the 19th Century due to river diversion for coastal marsh reclamation. Once rivers were re-directed to the coast; land subsidence induced by water extraction sustained erosion. From 1954 to 1984 mean shoreline retreat was approximately 9 m. In the 1960's, development of coastal tourism villages increased beach use and the need for house protection from storms. Detached breakwaters were built, trapping sand from adjacent coastal sectors. This induced shoreline progradation in protected sectors creating a wider beach, but unprotected coastal sectors experienced ...

AB  - This report assesses the impacts of the inclusion of two agricultural tracts, the exclusion of a marsh area, and the realignment of a floodwall in conjunction with the Larose to Golden Meadow, Louisiana, hurricane protection project. The project is located in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. Wetland losses associated with the project were also reevaluated. The project provides for a hurricane protection levee from Larose to Golden Meadow. The levee would extend about 21 miles on the west bank and 22 miles on the east bank of Bayou Lafourche. The complete systems would have a net elevation of +13.0 feet NGVD at Golden Meadow to +9.5 feet at Larose.

AB  - In 1881 our forefathers had decided to build a sea-lock to ensure an always safe access for sea-going vessels of Emden-Port and to get a better protection against storm surges. The fairway, the lock and the new dykes were finished in 1888. At that time, the calculation level for the highest tides was set up to Chart Datum +6.00 m (means NN +4.50 m). The tidal range was nearly 3.00 m. The crown of the surrounding dykes was at NN +5.80 m. In 2006, more than a hundred years later, the sea-lock was still in operation. However since 1999 the Emden-port engineers are busy to find a solution for a renovation program with three main topics. To re-establish a safety against storm surge water levels by using the old geometry. To build a second mitre-gate in the outer lock head, which is able to withstand the water pressure at high water level? To ensure a lock operation for a period of 25 to 30 years, because in the ages of 2025 it will be necessary to reconstruct the main access lock to the port, the "Great Emden Sea-Lock". The concept was almost finished; the investment was calculated to nearly 18 Mio. E. But then came November 1(rst) 2006. The night brought the highest high water level the Dollart Estuary had ever seen. The highest high water level from March 1906 with NN +5.18 m for Emden rose up for about 30 cm to a new maximum level of NN +5.48 m. Similar differences were recorded in the Dutch ports of Delfzijl and Eemshaven. The lock planning group was surprised about this water level; the water overtopped the old gates and flew around the mitre gate hinges. The foreseen lock planning conference one day later at Nov. 2(nd) was held and a remarkable proposal was made. It is not longer acceptable to support a renovation concept, which doesn't bring more safety against raising water levels, which only aims at a longer operation of the sea-lock and which requires a very high amount of money. The raising sea-water level needs more attention to be paid to. ne safety of some ten thousands of citizens must be considered and guaranteed. Because the satisfactory operation in Emden-Port cannot be achieved without a second smaller sea-lock it is impossible to close the Nesserland Sea-Lock. The lock must be renovated, but how?: A new outer lock-head with two roller-gates is to build seawards the old outer head. The lock-head and the sea-dike are to rise up by nearly 2.0 m to a height of NN +7.50 m. A new inner lock-head with a roller gate is to build also inwards the old inner head. The old lock chamber is to rebuild and be replaced by a new wider chamber The lock entrance width and depth will be adjusted to modem coastal and inland vessels. The paper deals with the background of the first renovation concept and the discussion due to the approval authorities and the ministries for economic affairs and coastal protection about the necessity and the design water level after the November 1(rst) storm surge event. Some details about the approval procedure will be given and first results of the construction shall be presented.

AB  - The Svalbard breeding population of light-bellied brent geese which winters in Denmark and at Lindisfarne, England, changed distribution and habitat use within all six areas used during the 1980s and colonised two new areas during the late 1980s and one during the early 1990s. There appeared to be two major causes of these changes: (1) the reduction or even disappearance of Zostera beds in four of the traditionally used areas, due to increased eutrophication and probably also changes in sedimentation processes, following constructions of barrages at Mariager Fjord and a causeway at Lindisfarne; and (2) the remaining beds of Zostera apparently have been depleted more rapidly in autumn and winter partly as a result of increased goose site use. In addition comes the cessation of cattle grazing and hay cutting of salt marshes in the formerly most important spring staging area. These changes have led to increased use of other areas and the establishment of three new areas of international importance for this brent goose population. The implications of the new patterns of dispersal are discussed in relation to future management of the areas used by the brent geese. Recommendations include improved management of salt marshes throughout their range and preparation of an international conservation plan.

AB  - Based on field research and computer modelling, an outline sand budget was established for the East Anglian coast. This budget shows that the sandy beaches of Norfolk, Suffolk, and northermost Essex depend of the erosion of cliffs for their sand supply, and enables the authors to relate beach volumes to the rate of littoral drift. Economical coastal defence works should aim at maintaining high beach levels, which will protect structures and also favour the very important tourist trade. At some (although by no means all) locations sand feeds are likely to be more economical than improved walls or revetments. Discussion on the paper is included on p.111-118. (A)

AB  - The goal of the study was to evaluate various coastal restoration and protection projects and the associated benefits for reductions in storm surge and wave height. Efforts in numerical modeling have been made to create a database of storm surge and wave responses to a set of hypothetical storms under current and various future conditions. The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and the Unstructured Simulating WAves Nearshore (UnSWAN) models were selected for this study. A coarser version of the state-of-the-art, southern Louisiana, unstructured mesh was developed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining critical hydraulic features. Model outputs were reviewed and analyzed from coastwide and onshore-transect points of view. The potential benefits of restoration and protection projects proposed in the Master Plan were examined by comparing Future without Action outputs to the Master Plan outputs. Hurricane protection projects, such as levees, provide remarkable protection at their leesides but increase and redistribute surge water at their front sides. Narrow, restored landscapes, such as barrier islands or ridges, may provide wave attenuation to some extent but, in many cases, provide minimal benefits in surge level reduction. Larger-scale restoration projects, such as sediment diversions, can result in land accretion and enhance vegetation coverage, thus resulting in notable benefits associated with damping waves and storm surge and ultimately reducing risk for inland communities.

AB  - The potential scale and impact of biological invasions in coastal waters is demonstrated by invasions in the San Francisco Bay/Delta Estuary. Biodiversity, ecosystem processes and human activities have already been substantially affected, while new organisms continue to be introduced into the ecosystem. Protecting coastal biodiversity, and preventing new impacts on the human use of coastal resources, will require regulation of the various mechanisms by which exotic marine and freshwater organisms are transported across oceans and continents to California. The broad scope of the problem is known, as are some of the steps needed to reduce the rate of transport and invasion. The most critical vector now operating is undoubtedly the transport of organisms in ships' ballast water. To reduce the flood of invasions into California's coastal waters, there is an urgent need for the adoption and implementation of clear legal requirements for the high-seas exchange of ballast water.

AB  - Salt marsh restoration is hypothesized to provide shoreline stabilization, increased fish habitat, and organic carbon subsidies for estuarine food webs. Organic carbon comes from diverse primary producers that differ in carbon fixation rates and areal extent within wetland systems. This study was designed to obtain some of the first estimates of the relative contribution of different primary producers to total organic carbon production within open water and tidally flooded wetlands of the northern San Francisco Estuary (SEE). Carbon fixation rates of phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, and low marsh emergent vegetation were measured in two natural and four restoring wetlands in 2004. Areal (m super(2)) rates of carbon fixation were greatest for low marsh vegetation, while phytoplankton and microphytobenthos rates were one and two orders of magnitude lower, respectively. However, when areal production rates were scaled to the amount of habitat available for each primary producer group, the relative importance of each group varied by location. Given that each primary producer group supports a different subset of estuarine consumers, the type of food subsidy desired should influence the amount open water channel, mudflat and low marsh area restored. Large-scale wetland restoration activities should consider the types of primary producers likely to occupy restored habitats when estimating future food web impacts.

AB  - Current conventional erosion protection techniques are both costly and can detract from the natural environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe how Presque Isle State Park, located along the shoreline of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania, implemented a low-cost and innovative erosion protection project. Erosion within the back bay area of the park threatened the park's heavily used mufti-purpose trail. With a matching grant from the Great Lakes Commission, the park developed a plan that placed riprap off the shoreline of the trail, anchored downed trees from the park in the riprap to function as timber groins, and then filled in the area between the trail and the riprap with sand dredged from a local sandbar. Geotextile and wattles were then positioned in the fill to aid in vegetative rooting. After placement of the geotextile and wattles, indigenous vegetation was transplanted in the newly created area. Completion of the project resulted in several additional acres of stabilized vegetation while providing an economical, natural, and aesthetic alternative to conventional shoreline erosion protection. The project affords a valuable example to other parks and recreational facilities along the Great Lakes faced with the challenge of minimizing erosion and maintaining a natural appearance.

AB  - Consideration of sustainability principles and the assessment of impacts from multiple developments on sensitive estuarine and coastal environments are emerging factors in the planning of coastal infrastructure. Concurrent planning of four large schemes at Saltend on the Humber (including Hull sewage-treatment works, a power station, a ferry terminal and reclamation, and flood-defence works) dictated that a cumulative impact study should be carried out. Discussions with regulatory authorities established several issues of potential concern, including the integrity of the adjacent 'special protection area' (birds and ecology), estuarine flows, sediment movement and water quality and construction traffic. Detailed baseline monitoring and predictive modelling concluded that there were likely to be no significant impacts, provided that appropriate inter-scheme construction phasing and coordinated application of a suite of mitigation measures were included. Adopting the precautionary principle, continued monitoring, and review over a 3-5 year period were agreed as part of the planning process, coordinated by the planning authorities and regulators.

AB  - Alterations to Louisiana's coastal landscape during the last 200 years have resulted in major changes to the natural hydrologic regime. Hurricane and tornado winds further impact coastal forests by exacerbating conditions that affect community structure, growth, and regeneration. Twenty-three years of study of forested wetlands in the Lake Verret watershed provide an opportunity to relate changes in forest communities to precipitation, drought, storms, and rising water levels. The area had two communities in 1986, but four communities were present by 2009. A major change in community composition occurred in drier sites after Hurricane Andrew (1992), when Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) became established. Swamp plots were generally not affected by hurricanes, but composition continued to change as a result of flooding. After Hurricane Andrew, net primary productivity (NPP) declined dramatically until 2001. Subsequent hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 also caused reductions in NPP, but recovery was rapid. Low-lying and transition areas are trending from bottomland communities toward more of a deepwater swamp as baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) increase their stature, likely due to the system-wide flooding. Natural ridges are flooded less often and have remained primarily bottomland, though Chinese tallow (Triadica sebiferum) numbers increased following Hurricane Andrew.

AB  - ABSTRACT On 22 September 2001, a collision occurred between the M/V NEW AMITY and barge, NMS No. 1486 in the Houston Ship Channel. The collision resulted in damage to a single skinned fuel tank of the NEW AMITY and created an oil spill in Upper Galveston Bay near Morgans Point, Texas. The double-hulled cargo oil tanks on the NEW AMITY were not damaged. Additionally, none of the tanks on the NMS No. 1486 were damaged. Immediately after the incident, the damaged tanker was directed by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) and Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) to proeceed to the nearest lay berth. The Port of Houston Barbours Cut container terminal was less that a mile away and the tanker arrived while still leaking oil. A reported 36,000 gallons of IFO-380 was released before the source could be controlled; much of the oil being trapped under the pier structures within Barbours Cut. The oil spill impacted some 20 miles of shoreline habitat including salt marshes, sand and shell beaches, and riprap. T...

AB  - In February 2002 the City of Dublin experienced severe flooding as a result of what was believed to be a combination of unusually high tides and meteorological surges. The disruption to the city prompted the Dublin City Council to put in place a programme of works of which the Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Project is a seminal part. Subsequent analysis of tidal records and meteorological conditions has shown that the return period for the event of Is' February 2002 was not unusual. This paper will describe the development of a coastal flood forecasting system for the City of Dublin taking account of the state of coastal defences along the coast line as well as the Rivers Tolka, Dodder and Liffey. It will describe the role of numerical modelling to derive sea state conditions along the coastline affected. When coupled with a finite element hydrodynamic model, a model of the Rivers Liffey, Dodder and Tolka and overtopping, enable forecasts of future high tides and potential flooding to be made and actions taken. The emphasis is on the practical application of the results of the numerical modelling within a coastal flood forecasting system. The Paper will also describe the role of the project within the European Strategies & Actions For Emergency Risk management initiative (SAFER) and the development of best practice within a wider European context. The SAFER project has been constituted to promote a risk management approach to flooding focused on three central themes of: (a) provision of flood hazard and risk information; (b) flood emergency response planning and management delivered at the local level through (c) flood partnerships.

AB  - A sequence of vertically stacked shoreline facies exposed by unprecedented water level lowering in Lake St Lucia, South Africa, records multiple occupation of the same shoreline (5-6m amsl) on at least eight occasions since the late Cretaceous. The sequence involves a basal wave-cut surface that is the outcrop of a regional unconformity cut into Late Cretaceous siltstone with occasional borings, representing a hardground (Facies 1). This is succeeded by a limestone unit indicative of sedimentation in a region of low terrigenous input quite different to today. This commences with a 10cm-thick unit comprising corals and giant clams that colonised the hardground as a shallow reef (Facies 2). The reef has an erosional upper surface that is overlain by a 30-50cm thick coquina (Facies 3) with characteristic sand-lined branching burrows, representing a coarse clastic beach unit. This is equated with the Uloa Formation of Miocene/Pliocene age. This unit has in turn been colonised by a patchy development of a coral reef of a single species, representing a renewed phase of reef development (Facies 4). The reef and the underlying Facies 3 have been wave-planed and eroded to form an erosional rocky shoreline with small potholes on a shore platform. The potholes are encrusted with barnacles and oysters to form a distinctive unit (Facies 5). The oysters and barnacles are encrusted with red algae suggesting a slight subsequent rise in sea level which is also associated with the formation of an erosional notch and a higher level shore platform with several small erosional gullies (Facies 6). These gullies are in turn encrusted by thick accumulations of serpulid worm tubes (Facies 7) into which two subsequent notches have been cut by wave action. The shorelines preserved represent a succession of sea level highstands within a few metres of the contemporary sea level since Late Cretaceous times. They survived intervening sea level lowerings and fluvial incision by virtue of their location on an interfluve between adjacent incised valleys. Early cementation would have also been key to their preservation. Each shoreline facies was in turn influenced by the antecedent conditions imparted by the preceding shoreline as well as the contemporaneous conditions of sediment supply, sea level change and the surrounding palaeogeography. The presence of limestone and the absence of clasts or storm beach deposits suggests a protected coastline. The intermittent occurrence of coral and the reduced coral assemblage suggests that the water may not always have been fully marine. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Plant mortality associated with the growing frequency and intensity of heatwaves and dry spells is increasingly occurring in various ecosystems worldwide. However, the impacts of extreme events on plant communities of ultramafic soils are still unknown. Here, we describe a first case of plant mortality on serpentine outcrops in Italy following a heat and drought event that occurred between autumn 2016 and summer 2017. Mortality of perennial plants was assessed in thirty plots representing ten major serpentine areas along a SW-NE gradient, with the sparse vegetation of ultramafic soils. Statistical modelling was based on temperature and precipitation data and local site conditions. Responses of single species were largely different and not related to their taxonomic position, growth form or level of edaphic specialization for serpentine soils. Notably, obligate serpentine endemics were not less impacted than non-endemics. As expected, species mortality decreased with increasing chromosome number, suggesting higher tolerance and adaptive capacity in taxa of likely polyploid origin. Mortality increased with decreasing number of rainy days and duration of the heatwave and decreased with increasing distance from the Tyrrhenian coastline, reaching 60% in the southern and western areas with a Mediterranean climate. Local site conditions such as increasing soil depth and north-facing aspect significantly increased plant survivorship. Our findings show that extreme drought and heat can have a previously unrealized impact on ultramafic plant communities in the short term. Further studies should examine the recovery capacity and resilience of serpentine plants, together with the long term effects.

AB  - Barrier islands are found around the world, and their geomorphic evolution is related to ocean and estuarine processes. Processes including sediment mobilization and shoreline evolution on both the ocean and estuarine side of barrier islands, control long-term evolution through many short-term (days) events (e.g., hurricanes, nor’easters). The Outer Banks of North Carolina are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Albemarle and Pamlico Sound Estuarine System, the second largest estuary in the U.S. Back-barrier environments in the system are extensive with over 1500 km of estuarine shoreline in Dare County (McVerry, 2012). The back-barrier coast of Rodanthe, a small town on the Outer Banks, consists of an undulating shoreline, adjacent to a broad (∼4 km) shallow shoal (<2 m) widely covered with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Shoreline and volumetric change rates, bathymetry, surface sediment grain properties, and hydrodynamic conditions were measured to evaluate sediment processes, SAV coverage and change over time. Understanding these back-barrier sediment processes is important for navigation, shoreline, and ecosystem management. Shoreline change rates (SCR) were evaluated using aerial photographs from five time steps (i.e., 1949, 1974, 2007, 2012, 2015). The average long-term SCR across the study region was -0.41 m y-1, but there was much variability. Data show the southern shoreline dominated by erosion and marsh loss with an increase in sediment banks and modification. Single-beam bathymetric confirmed the presence of a broad (∼4 km) back-barrier shoal. Surface sediment grab samples displayed a dominance of fine sands with modest variation in grain size across the region and very low mud percent and organic content. Bathymetric change of the emergency navigational channel showed large deposition, and the timing suggests the importance of storm-related transport (e.g. Hurricanes Isabel, Ophelia, Irene). Calculated bed shear stresses based on the measured waves and currents indicate that bed shear stress during storms can exceed threshold of motion conditions (i.e., 0.18 N/m2) for the mean basin grain size (199 μm). Aerial photography revealed the area was largely covered by SAV. Occurrence of SAV over 10 years showed little variation with consistent coverage. An optimal depth range of SAV (0.5-2.2 m) was determined based on bathymetric mapping. Three conclusions were derived from data: (1) Erosion and shoreline hardening are both important shoreline change process along on the back-barrier. High shoreline erosion rates and marsh shoreline loss lead to an increase in sediment banks or anthropogenically modified shorelines. (2) Critical shear stresses of motion are exceeded episodically with fresh breezes or stronger winds (>10 m s-1), and ferry channel bathymetry suggest considerable sediment transport and deposition during high-wind events (e.g., hurricanes). The dominant back-barrier shoal sediments were clean, medium sands (i.e., low mud %, low loss on ignition). The low mud percent and low loss on ignition are likely maintained by regular wave reworking. (3) SAV in the study area has been persistent through time at water depths between 0.5-2.2 m. This depth range is consistent with other SAV studies and is attributable to water-level and light limitations.

AB  - Portugal's northwest coast, between Ovar and Marinha Grande presents an important sediment deficit, mainly due to rivers sediments supply reduction and harbors' constrains. The sediment transport capacity resulting from the wave's action (mainly from the northwest) is nourished with the sand of the up drift beaches, leading to the shoreline's erosion and retreat. The shoreline retreat represents conflicts with the land use and human occupation, and the protection of people and properties becomes essential. Thus, coastal interventions (seawalls and groins), try to constrain the shoreline evolution, conducting to an artificial coast and site aesthetical deterioration. This work's objective is to present an analysis of the shoreline evolution, in order to select a suitable model of coastal intervention. Thus, the current paper aimed a diagnostic based in the shoreline evolution indicators in the period between 1994-2011: a) average rate of shoreline retreat; b) number of coastal defense structures implemented; c) number of coastal emergency works and interventions; and d) number of registered events related to shoreline retreat (overtopping, dune system and coastal structures partial destruction). This analysis highlights the location of the most vulnerable areas. Furthermore, different scenarios of coastal defense interventions are discussed, having as variable the associated investment costs, which represents different strategies and impacts, namely: a) maintain the existent coastal defense structures; b) adapt the existent coastal defense structures; c) perform artificial nourishments; and d) propose new coastal defense solutions. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - 1. Foveaux Strait, a narrow seaway that is exposed to heavy wave action and strong tidal currents, has been the subject of an oyster fishery for over 130 years. Before the oyster fishery commenced the seafloor was extensively covered by epifaunal reefs that were tidally-oriented, linear aggregations of patch reefs. 2. Patch reefs are formed by the bryozoan Cinctipora elegans cemented by encrusting bryozoa, ascidians, sponges, and polychaetes. The molluscan epifauna is dominated by the oyster, Tiostrea chilensis and bysally attached bivalves. Mortality of oysters is probably lower and recruitment and growth may be higher within the reef habitat. 3. Fishers found commercial densities of oysters occurred only on epifaunal reefs. Fishers exploited local groups of reefs. These groups form the patchily distributed oyster beds characteristic of this fishery. 4. Dredging for oysters progressively modified reefs until oysters were the only epifauna remaining. Dredges caught oysters more efficiently after the catch bag no longer became saturated with other epifauna. This heightened efficiency allowed fishers to rapidly reduce oyster density to commercial extinction. Oyster density has not rebuilt on oyster beds abandoned by fishers. 5. The rate of modification of epifaunal reefs was slower during the early years of the fishery but has accelerated, especially over the last 37 years. Frequency of disturbance increased as the numbers of vessels fishing grew and fishers developed speedier dredging methods. Intensity of disturbance also increased as heavier dredges were introduced and allowed focused fishing of reefs. 6. Oysters became reduced to low densities in the eastern and central areas that fishers then abandoned. The commercially exploited area subsequently expanded to the limits of Foveaux Strait. 7. With accelerated modification of oyster habitat, disease mortality has become more important. 8. Attempting to rebuild the fishery by oyster enhancement may be more successful conjoined with habitat restoration. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A case history concerning the design and management aspects of a coastal protection system built by the Italian National Railway Authority (NRA) during the 80's is reported. The intervention was built in order to protect the main national railway line to Sicily from the severe damages induced by the wave action. In particular, the impact of a breakwater/groin system, based on a T-shaped structure, along the Tyrrhenian coast from Paola to San Lucido, in the South of Italy, has been considered. In 2005, the local Administration promoted a lawsuit against the NRA. The local Administration denounced the negative effect of the intervention arguing that the presence of the defense structures caused an accretion of sediments in the protected area and interrupted the long-shore sediment transport, determining a relevant downdrift beach erosion. The case of a lawsuit evoking a loss of beach induced by maritime works represents the first case in Italy.

AB  - Today the Ria de Aveiro of northern Portugal has a hydromorphological regime in which river influence is limited to periods of flood. For most of the annual cycle, tidal currents and wind waves are the major forcing agents in this complex coastal lagoon-estuarine system. The system has evolved over two centuries from one that was naturally fluvially dominant to one that is today tidally dominant. Human influence was a trigger for these changes, starting in 1808 when its natural evolution was halted by the construction of a new inlet/outlet channel through the mobile sand spit that isolates it from the Atlantic Ocean. In consequence, tidal ranges in the lagoon increased rapidly from similar to 0.1 m to >1 m and continued to increase, as a result of continued engineering works and dredging, today reaching similar to 3 m on spring tides. Hydromorphological adjustments that have taken place include the deepening of channels, an increase in the area of inter-tidal flats, regression of salt marsh, increased tidal propagation and increased saline intrusion. Loss of once abundant submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), due to increased tidal flows, exacerbated by increased recreational activities, has been accompanied by a change from fine cohesive sediments to coarser, mobile sediments with reduced biological activity.

AB  - Analysis of long-term land use and land cover (LULC) changes requires up-to-date remotely sensed data to assess their effects on erosion. This is a particularly important assessment for regions with semi-arid landscapes where soils tend to be scarce and proper management necessitates matching LULC to local conditions to achieve sustainable land use. This study evaluates the impact of LULC changes on erosion using Landsat satellite imagery and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model on the plains around the Jarahi River and the Shadegan International Wetlands. Supervised-classification and maximum-likelihood methods were applied to pre-processed TM, ETM, and OLI images for 1989, 2003, and 2017 to prepare LULC maps. The areal extents of agricultural land, wetlands, waterbodies, and built-up regions increased by 9.48%, 2.52%, 3.44%, and 0.13% from 1989 to 2003, respectively. During this timeframe bare (or barren) lands and wetland vegetation decreased by 11.44% and 4.13%. Between 2003 and 2017, however, the areas of bare lands, waterbodies, and built-up areas increased 12.77%, 1.52%, and 0.30%, while agricultural lands, wetlands, and wetland vegetation decreased by 9.99%, 1.32%, and 3.27%. According to the results, the areal extent of erosion at a rate > 1.1–5 Mg ha−1 year−1 has been increased by about 45.56%, 50.06% and 52.24 between 1989, 2003 and 2017. LULC changes led to increased soil erosion on agricultural and bare lands. This highlights the need to plan and manage changes to LULC to reduce erosion to and below sustainable levels. Nature-based solutions can be effectively used to reduce erosion.

AB  - New concrete pontoons for the SR520 Bridge Replacement Project in Seattle, Washington, were constructed at a new casting basin facility located in Aberdeen, WA, as a design-build project by Kiewit Corporation. Upon completion, the pontoons were towed from the casting basin into the nearby Chehalis River and Grays Harbor estuary via a 620-foot-long launch channel. The launch channel was constructed in December 2011 and the first completed pontoons were towed from the casting basin in July 2012; pontoon production will continue. This paper presents numerical modeling analysis, engineering design, and performance of the launch channel, including analysis of hydrodynamic forces on pontoons due to currents and passing vessel effects in the adjacent deep draft federal navigation channel. Due to the location of the launch channel and casting basin in the estuarine portion of the Chehalis River, the site is subject to processes including combined effects of tides, wind, waves, river discharge and vessel effects. All these factors were considered in designing the channel and estimating forces on the pontoons. Geomorphic analysis and three-dimensional numerical modeling were the basis for determining that the channel would initially experience a period of relatively more rapid sedimentation followed by more gradual sedimentation rates. Such rates of sedimentation were incorporated into the dredging plan as advance maintenance to minimize maintenance dredging frequency. The launch channel side slopes, composed of native soft silty sediments, are subject to erosion and scour primarily due to propeller wash from tugs operating in the channel. Numerical modeling of waves, currents, and propwash was performed to optimize the extents and type of armoring required. Based upon this analysis and coordination with professional tug operators, the final design achieved a significant reduction of rock armoring while maintaining protection for the channel slopes against scour. A unique rock slope key design was developed to transition from armored to soft unarmored slopes. Recommendations for turning dolphin design and tug operations were based on numerical modeling of effects of riverine and tidal currents on the pontoons at various positions in the channel and at various flows. Forces, moments, and pontoon motions were also developed to account for the potential effects of passing vessels on rafts of multiple completed pontoons temporarily moored along the navigation channel. These were provided to naval architects for design of mooring systems. Ongoing monitoring of the channel bathymetry indicates that the actual sedimentation rates were slightly lower than predicted. Side slope protection and towing forces appear adequate for continued cycling of pontoon construction into the future. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of a series of laboratory measurements of wave-induced morphodynamic changes across a simulated beach protected by a number of erosion control systems constructed from geotextiles and subjected to irregular waves of varying wave height and peak period but with a constant spectral shape (JONSWAP spectrum, gamma =3.3). The objectives of such experimental work were to investigate the efficiency of various systems in maintaining a beach and in protecting the shoreline. For this purpose different models of active and passive coastal defence schemes have been set-up to run on similar hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions. The intercomparison carried out on the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic output produced by each protection scheme focused on the scour development and more widespread beach lowering. The next step was to increase understanding of the response of the beach under persistent erosional conditions and under periods of erosion followed by infilling and again erosion.

AB  - The coastline of Bangladesh is mostly exposed to extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions where cyclones and storm surges cause devastating effects including loss of human lives and destruction of properties. Coastal vegetation has been considered as a low-cost and natural protection to reduce the energy of current and surge. Present study explored the effectiveness of coastal vegetation against cyclonic storm surge based on species composition, forest width and near-shore run-up slope revealed by field investigations and numerical simulations. A calibrated hydrodynamic numerical model based on modified one-dimensional depth-averaged non-linear long wave differential equations was used to simulate the storm surge mitigation effected by the coastal vegetation. Considering two different types of coastal species, mangrove species, Rhizophora apiculata and beach species, Casuarina equisetifolia, numerical simulations were conducted to assess the effect of coastal forest on the storm surge mitigation. This analysis showed that double layers of wide vegetation belt (300 m) in the vertical direction with R. apiculata and C. equisetifolia on mild slope (1:500) exhibited a strong potential to decrease surge wave height and velocity. However, water depth reduction was low compared with flow velocity reduction. The maximum water depth and current velocity reduced to 1.4m (22% reduction) and 1.2m/s (49% reduction), respectively, behind the vegetation in comparison with the case without vegetation. Wide coastal vegetation belt with mild slope might be suitable for storm surge energy reduction; however, a doubling or tripling of forest width (from 100 m to 200 m or 300 m) did not produce two-fold or three-fold increase of wave reduction with negligible additional velocity reduction. For the same vegetation density the wave energy reduction by R. apiculata was not increased significantly compared to the C. equisetifolia. But young densely C. equisetifolia found more effective to reduce storm surge energy. The information would be of value to policy and decision makers for coastal landscape planning, rehabilitation and coastal resource management.

AB  - Question: The vegetation in a polder after partial tidal restoration does not resemble the targeted salt-marsh vegetation. Is this difference in vegetation due to lack of dispersal or unsuitable abiotic conditions ? What could be done for a better restoration of the site? Location: Northwestern France. Methods: Seeds were trapped at the single inlet of the polder with a 200-μm mesh net to estimate inputs of seeds from the bay. In parallel, seed dispersal was studied in the polder by placing Astroturf® seed traps on the surface of the sediment at three different elevations in three distinct areas. Abiotic conditions such as flooding frequency, water table level and soil salinity were monitored. Results: All but one species from the adjacent salt marshes were trapped at the inlet. Not all of these species were on the seed traps inside the polder. Seed dispersal was not homogeneous in the polder and seed trap content mostly discriminated in function of their elevation. Salinity and water logging at the bottom of the slope were very high compared to tolerance of most halophytes but decreased rapidly higher up the slope. Conclusions: The development of salt marsh target species is highly restricted by limited hydrochory inside the polder but also by unfavourable soil conditions induced by the actual hydrological regime. Halophytes are excluded at the bottom of the slope by abiotic conditions and out-competed by sub-halophytes higher up. In order to restore salt marsh vegetation inside the polder, a larger opening should be induced in order to increase the flooded surface, and diminish water logging and flooding frequencies. © IAVS; Opulus Press.

AB  - The problem of the reflection of incident surface-water waves by undulations on the seabed is treated on the basis of linear perturbation theory. The flow is assumed to be two-dimensional, uniplanar, and nonseparating, and the undulations are assumed to be of limited horizontal extent, permitting results for the reflected and transmitted waves to be obtained by Fourier transform methods. A steady-state formulation of the problem is adopted, and this provides general results that are applied to the case of a patch of sinusoidal undulations on the bed. The principal conclusions are that the reflection coefficient is both oscillatory in the ratio of the length of the patch to the surface wavelength and, as expected, critically dependent upon the ratio of the surface-to-bed wavelengths. In addition, the transmitted wave may experience a small phase shift, even in cases of zero reflection. Examples are presented which indicate that relatively few bottom undulations with wavenumber equal to approximately twice the surface wavenumber may give rise to a substantial reflected wave. A possible consequence of this is a coupling between ripple growth and wave reflection, which may be important in problems of coastal protection.

AB  - Sea level rise is expected to increase worldwide over the coming decades, and its impacts are beginning to be felt in many areas. Two major direct impacts of sea level rise are submergence and salinity increase. Historically, the Mississippi River Delta has experienced a relative sea level rise (RSLR) and thus serves as an analogy or model for what can be expected elsewhere. Despite long term RSLR primarily due to subsidence, the Mississippi has grown in size over the past several thousand years since eustatic sea level stabilized. Within this century, the net positive growth rate has been reversed and net wetland loss rates as great as 100 km super(2) per year have occurred. Much of the wetland loss is associated with human activities that have resulted in a reduction of sediment input to wetlands. Because of this reduction, vertical accretion of the wetland surface is less than RSLR and plants are disappearing due to waterlogging and salinity increase. The resulting loss of wetland plant vigor complicates the problem because the production of plant roots is an important component of soil formation and vertical accretion of the wetland surface. Two important points to consider in addressing the problem of sea level rise is that there is often a lag time of decades before the response of the natural system to sea level rise becomes evident and that changes in the natural system may be slow at first and then accelerate. The institutional response in Louisiana is complicated, but many of the actions taken may be detrimental in the long run. A common response to rising water levels will be flood control. But, in the Mississippi Delta, dikes along the river have greatly restricted sediment input to wetlands. Additionally, semi-impoundments with water control structures are being considered to protect wetlands from increasing water levels and salinity increases. Many of these depend on gravity drainage, but in a microtidal area such as the Gulf coast, gravity drainage has a finite life span due to rising water levels. Land ownership patterns also complicate a comprehensive approach to the problem due to units selected for management and conflict between short-term and long-term benefits. We conclude that coastal wetlands can be managed to survive rising sea level but that only comprehensive, integrated, long-term planning can effectively deal with the problem of sea level rise. The principle of ecological engineering, where the energies of nature are used as much as possible, should play an integral part of any management plan. Because deltas are probably one of the most threatened of coastal landscapes, an early warning monitoring system is recommended for selected deltas of the world.

AB  - Because of a new Master Plan for Coastal Protection, most Belgian coastal cities are planning new protective measures for their beaches and coastal promenades. One of the first locations for these new measures is the coastal town of Wenduine. Three separate new constructions will be designed to protect the town as well as the coastal region for the following 50 years. As opposed to purely vertical or horizontal surface structures, structures consisting of both vertical parapets and horizontal slabs have rarely been considered. The behavior of these structures is more similar to bridge conduct, since the incident loads vary with time and space, than to classic coastal structures. The effect of wave impact on these structures results in local patch loading on a swaying system, introducing local deformations, stresses, and accelerations. This patch loading may cause local deformations, but does not necessarily cause collapse or endanger neither structural equilibrium nor stability. This article studies the structural response of monolithic concrete coastal protection structures. The focus is on the structural response of the structure, comfort conditions for use, and structural safety. This is analyzed by numerical modeling of the structural response based on recently proposed design values for such wave loading. These models include the actual structure as well as the influence of foundations and ground layers.

AB  - Recent studies in salt marshes have demonstrated the role of plant roots in sediment stabilisation, and hence the importance of marshes in providing coastal protection. However, the relative role of root traits and environmental factors in controlling sediment stability, and how intraspecific variability of root traits vary within and among marshes, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated which root trait(s) drive sediment stability (resistance to lateral erosion) in two marsh species with an important role in coastal protection (Spartina anglica and Atriplex portulacoides) and how the environment affects the expression of these traits. We sampled three marshes along salinity gradients in each of two estuaries in Wales (UK), establishing replicate plots in the respective dominant zones of each species. In all plots we sampled abiotic variables (sand, redox potential, pH, salinity) and root traits (root density, specific root density, root volume, root length density); in a subset of these plots (three per species in each marsh) we extracted soil-plant cores and assessed their erosion resistance in a flume. Sediment stability was enhanced by increases in root density and reductions in sand content. Abiotic variables affected root density in different ways depending on species: in S. anglica, redox was the only significant factor, with a positive, linear effect on root density; in A. portulacoides, redox had a non-linear (U-shaped) effect on root density, while sand had a negative effect. Collectively, these results show that (i) intraspecific variability in root density can influence sediment stability in salt marshes, and (ii) sediment properties not only influence sediment stability directly, but also indirectly via root density. These results shed light on spatial variability in the stability of salt marshes to lateral erosion and suggest that root density should be incorporated into coastal vegetation monitoring programs as an easy-to-measure root trait that links the environment to sediment stability and hence to the function and services provided by marshes. © 2019 De Battisti, Fowler, Jenkins, Skov, Rossi, Bouma, Neyland and Griffin.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2017 - Aberdeen Conference Start Date: 2017, June 19 Conference End Date: 2017, June 22 Conference Location: Aberdeen, United Kingdom Tidal stream energy is a reliable and predictable low-carbon energy source. Over the next few years the first arrays of multiple tidal stream turbines will be deployed mostly in UK, French and Canadian waters. The potential environmental effects should first be examined, in order to scale and site them appropriately. Large theoretical arrays of tidal stream turbines were designed for Scottish Waters (UK), to quantify the available power and the ocean response to its extraction. A comprehensive assessment of the tidal energy resource realistically available for electricity generation and the study of the potential environmental impacts associated with its extraction in Scottish Waters, can then lead the way to further development in different countries with potential tidal stream energy sources. In order to examine both local (<100 km) and region-wide (>100 km) spatial scales, the Scottish Shelf Model, an unstructured grid three-dimensional FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model) implementation, is a useful tool, since it covers the entire NW European Shelf, but with a high resolution where the tidal stream energy is extracted. The arrays of tidal stream turbines were implemented in the model using the momentum sink approach, in which a momentum sink term represents the loss of momentum due to tidal energy extraction. A typical annual cycle of the NW European Shelf hydrodynamics was reproduced by the SSM model and compared with the same period perturbed by tidal stream energy extraction. The power extracted by the tidal stream arrays was estimated, taking into account the tidal stream energy extraction feedbacks on the flow and considering the realistic operation of a generic tidal stream turbine, which is limited to operate in a range of flow velocities due to technological constraints. The ocean response to tidal stream power extraction was then analysed at the temporal scale of a spring-neap tidal cycle and, for the first time, on longer term seasonal timescales. It is shown that the very large tidal stream arrays can introduce detectable changes to the tidal elevation, marine currents and ocean stratification patterns. Tidal elevation mainly increases upstream of the tidal farms locations (considering the direction of propagation of the tidal wave), while a decrease in the mean spring tidal range is observed downstream, along the UK East Coast and also in the Irish Sea. Marine currents, both tidal and residual flows, are also affected. They can slow down due to the turbines' action or speed up due to flow diversion and blockage processes, on both a local and regional scale. The strongest signal in tidal velocities is an overall reduction, which can in turn decrease the energy of tidal mixing and perturb the seasonal stratification on the NW European Shelf. Although the strength of summer stratification has been found to slightly increase, the extent of the stratified region does not greatly change, thus suggesting the enhanced biological and pelagic biodiversity hotspots, e.g. tidal mixing front locations, are not displaced. Such large-scale tidal stream energy extraction is unlikely to occur in the near future, since very large numbers of devices are required, but such potential changes should be considered when planning future tidal energy exploitation. It is likely that large scale developments around the NW European shelf will interact and could, for example, intensify or weaken the changes predicted here, or even be used as mitigation measures (e.g. coastal defence) for other changes, e.g. effects of climate change.

AB  - As a result of the construction of a storm-surge barrier across the mouth of the Oosterschelde (SW Netherlands) in 1987, the tidal range and mean high water level in the estuary have been reduced permanently to about 88% of their original values. During the final stage of construction (1985–1987) the tidal range and mean high water level were reduced even further for more than 18 months, by up to about 65% of their original values. This paper describes the consequences of these reductions for some abiotic aspects of the salt marshes.

AB  - Riverine floods and coastal inundation by storm surges are the most frequent of natural disasters, affecting millions of people across the globe every year. The forecasting of floods and storm surge at the global scale is crucial to preparing for severe events and providing early awareness where local models and warning services are lacking. Developments in modelling capabilities, data availability, and computational resources in recent years have made it possible to produce global scale flood forecasts. Operational systems currently have the capability to produce discharge and water level forecasts in the medium-range and disseminate forecasts and early warning products in real time across the globe, in support of national forecasting capabilities. Deltares currently runs two global forecasting systems: Global Flood Forecasting Information System (GLOFFIS) and Global Storm Surge Information System (GLOSSIS). These systems are run from an open experimental information and communications technology facility, IdLab, and are being used to test new ideas around interoperability, hydrological/hydrodynamical predictability, big data, and visualization. GLOFFIS and GLOSSIS produce global flood and storm surge forecasts up to four times per day, with a 10 day forecast horizon (Deltares, 2017). These forecasts can be used for early warning in areas that currently lack adequate local forecasting capabilities. In areas where such capabilities are already available, these systems can provide boundary conditions to regional or local models to further improve these. The underlying hydrodynamic and hydrological models are constantly improved and updated, to further increase their accuracy. With improvements in weather forecasting, future advances may include more seamless hydrological forecasting at the global scale alongside a move towards multi-model forecasts and grand ensemble techniques, responding to the need of developing multi-hazard early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. The global forecasts from GLOFFIS and GLOSSIS are made available through various online channels, like web applications and FTP. A subset of results has been made available free of charge in June 2017 via www.GlobalFloodForecast.com. It is foreseen that the full or higher resolution results will be provided through a service with subscription fee by the end of 2017.

AB  - The Dutch lowland rivers Rhine and Meuse have lost much of their natural character and many species of riverine fish have become rare or extinct due to water pollution, habitat loss, and exploitation over the last century. Since the 1980s, management measures have been taken to improve water quality and to restore habitats and fish migration opportunities. Rehabilitation includes amongst others enhancing the active floodplain dynamics through (re)connecting isolated floodplain waters to the main river channel. Fish passages along weirs and sluices have been constructed and, at dammed estuaries, discharge regimes will be adjusted to facilitate fish migration. There are several lines of evidence that these measures have contributed to a rehabilitation of riverine fish populations. Studies in newly created side channels demonstrate the enhancement of nursery habitat. A cost-effective monitoring programme based on registration of by-catches from commercial (fykenet) fishermen carried out since 1993 in the Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands reveals that the population levels of many rare (mainly red list) species show increasing trends, demonstrating the improvement of the ecological quality of Rhine and Meuse. Rehabilitation of the floodplain function and reducing the impact of hydromorphological barriers could further enhance fish populations at the river basin level. The response of different fish species to river rehabilitation has been variable and may have different causes. We conclude that fish community changes are sensible indicators of ecological rehabilitation when the response time (≥ 10 years) is taken into account, which requires long-term monitoring.

AB  - Ecosystem-based coastal protection by means of conserving, restoring or creating intertidal ecosystems that attenuate waves and stabilize shorelines, offers a promising way to climate proof coastlines for the future. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an ecosystem engineering species, which is known for its wave attenuating and sediment trapping ecosystem services, but it remains unknown to which extent this is conditional. We aim to test the hypothesis that the ecosystem engineering effect concerning sediment trapping and stability by oyster reefs is conditional, and can be predicted based on I) local physical forcing, ii) morphological characteristics of the tidal flat, and iii) biological characteristics of the oyster reef. Analyses of long-term sediment accretion patterns on natural intertidal oyster reefs at the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands) showed that this ecosystem engineering effect is strongest on tidal flats under erosional conditions, lower aspect ratio (i.e., relative long and narrow reefs), relatively closed reefs (i.e., few open patches) and higher coverage of oysters within reef patches. The ability of C. gigas to shape the environment thus depends both on biotic and abiotic conditions, meaning that oyster reefs only work under specific conditions for erosion control. Overall, our results provide baseline understanding for ecosystem management aimed at affecting sediment dynamics, thereby contributing to a better understanding for designing ecosystem-based solutions under different abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, present study provides a clear example of how we need to gain a better understanding of the conditionality of ecosystem services in general, to be able to create and restore ecosystems for obtaining their services.

AB  - The Dutch Delta Region (S-W Netherlands) origi- nally consisted of interconnected estuaries, interfacing the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Schelde with the North Sea. The ecosystems were immature, with physical rather than bio- logical control of population dynamics. Main functions were shipping and shellfisheries. An emergent function of the inter- connected estuaries was the buffering and upgrading of river- borne substances before they entered the sea. Execution of the Delta Project in the period 1960-1986 resulted in isolation of several water systems disconnected from rivers and sea, and loss of gradients within these systems. Population dynamics were now controlled by chemical and biological rather than physical factors. Vulnerability to exter- nal perturbation increased. These changes also affected the buffering capacity, i.e. reduced the utility of the area as stabi- liser of the geosystem. Recreational use and appreciation of natural values increased, potentially conflicting with shipping and shellfisheries. Retrospective analysis of the environmental policy and management revealed three consecutive strategies in the Delta Project. 1. Reactive one-issue management, focusing on safety against flooding only. This strategy aimed at complete closure of the estuaries thus transforming them into fresh water lakes. It has destroyed feed-backs and buffering between coastal and inland waters. This strategy has not promoted sustainable development and has increased the vulnerability of the area to future catastrophes. 2. Protective bio-ecological management focused on the preservation of existing values of landscape and environment, and resulted in the maintenance of saline condi- tions and preservation of marshes by shore protection meas- ures. The drawback of this passive orientation to existing values Owhere they are nowO is the necessity of continuous intensive care because the natural adaptive ability is not being restored. 3. Constructive geo-ecological management is based on understanding functional properties within and between ecosystems as integrated elements of the landscape structure. This strategy aims at environmental protection, restoration and development of values Owhere they must beO. Re-establish- ment of gradients by e.g. re-introducing tidal influence and by restoring salt marshes should contribute to sustainable devel- opment.

AB  - The tidal dock called Deurganckdok (Port of Antwerp) is situated in the macro tidal estuary of the Scheldt River and is directly connected to the river without the shielding properties of a lock. Due to its position in the estuary near the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM) of the estuary, large amounts of silt and clay are available for sedimentation. The dock effectively acts as a sediment trap, with a trapping efficiency as high as 0.43. During the first five years after its commissioning, the sedimentation of the dock has been closely followed by means of intensive monitoring of both long-term point measurements and through tide campaigns with high spatial resolution. The mass balance of the dock's sediment bed has been monitored using density profiling. It was shown that the average rate of sedimentation of the dock is as high as 1 cm/day. A semi-empirical model of the siltation of the dock has been developed to gain insights in the contribution of the different mechanisms of sediment exchange with the Scheldt River. Long term siltation calculations shown the model is capable of reproducing the sediment balance of the dock. After numerical and physical modeling it was shown that a Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) has the potential to reduce the sedimentation in the dock (Roose et al, 2013). The construction of this structure has now been executed and the first monitoring results are available of the post-construction period. Due to the natural variability of the estuarine sediment concentration levels, the statistical trend change cannot be proven yet, but measurements of the flow pattern near the dock entrance reveal changes that can be incorporated in a semi-empirical model of the sedimentation, bringing forward first estimates of the sedimentation reduction in the dock. © 2013 WODA.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2015 - Genova Conference Start Date: 2015, May 18 Conference End Date: 2015, May 21 Conference Location: Genova, Italy With the increasing tendency of natural hazards, the typhoon, hurricane and tropical cyclone induced surge, wave, precipitation, flood and wind as extreme external loads menaced Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) in coastal provinces of China. For all of constructed NPP in China the National Nuclear Safety Administration of China and IAEA recommended Probable Maximum Hurricane /Typhoon/(PMH/T), Probable Maximum Storm Surge (PMSS), Probable Maximum Flood (PMF), Design Basis Flood (DBF) as safety regulations are used for NPP site evaluation installations and coastal defense infrastructures. This paper compare our proposed multivariate compound extreme value distribution (CEVD and MCEVD) with IAEA 2006-2011 recommended safety regulation for NPP coastal defense infrastructures along China coast. 2005 hurricane Katrina and 2012 hurricane Sandy induced disasters proved 1982 CEVD and 2006 MCEVD predicted extreme hazards in New Orleans and New Jersey areas. 2013 typhoon Fitow induced typhoon disaster in China also proved MCEVD 2004-2006 predicted results. The first and second costliest hurricane disasters in United States history occurred only in the past seven years. 2008 Typhoon Saomai induced 3.76 m storm surges and 7 m waves which caused 240 deaths, sunk 952 ships and damaged 1594 in Shacheng harbor. If typhoon Saomai had landed 2 hours later, then the simultaneous occurrence of the typhoon surge and high spring tide with 7 m wave would have inundated most areas of the Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, where Qinshan NPP were located. Extreme typhoon hazards menaced some constructed NPP coastal defense designed by traditional safety regulations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Burning was evaluated as a method of remediating oiled Louisiana Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. A short-term reduction in plant biomass was observed; however, 1 year after burning, plant biomass was the same as in control plots. A comparison of the normal alkane profile in the soil residue following oiling to preburn oil showed a loss of more volatile hydrocarbons. Similar patterns were observed for aromatic hydrocarbons. More than half the aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the plume were derived from unburned hydrocarbons. Carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the main sulfur gases found in the smoke plume.

AB  - The Dutch safety assessment of dikes, dunes and storm surge barriers is carried out every 5 year, resulting in strengthening plans for the sections that do not comply with the safety standards. The Secretary of State provides the water defence authorities with Hydraulic Boundary Conditions. This paper handles the probabilistic approach to derive them, the method to carry out the safety assessment and the verification of the model based on the method by comparison with field data. The probabilistic approach is based on Monte Carlo Important Sampling. The method takes into account several failure mechanisms, such as overtopping and stability of revetments. The verification is carried out for several locations and shows a satisfactory agreement. Less good agreement is found at areas where currents affect the wave parameters like for instance in estuaries. In 2007 the derived Hydraulic Boundary Conditions were formalized by the Secretary of State for the coming safety assessment.

AB  - Establishing trees in agricultural bottomlands is challenging because of intense competition, flooding and herbivory. A summary is presented of new practices and management systems for regenerating trees in former agricultural fields in the eastern USA. Innovations have come from improvements in planting stock and new silvicultural systems that restore ecological function more quickly than traditional afforestation with single-species stands. Advances in nursery production of large (e.g. 1-2 m tall; 1.5-2.0 cm basal diameter) bareroot and container seedlings with well-developed root systems have led to increases in survival and growth, and early seed production. In addition to planting high-quality seedlings, managing vegetation is critical to regeneration success. Planting seedlings with cover crops such as redtop grass (Agrostis gigantea Roth) may improve tree survival and growth by controlling competing vegetation and reducing animal herbivory. An innovative strategy that simulates natural succession involves interplanting later seral species such as Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii Palm.) in young plantations of pioneer species such as Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. Populus L. acts as a nurse crop for Quercus L. by reducing biomass of competing vegetation without seriously limiting Quercus L. seedling growth or function. Harvest of the short-rotation Populus L. crop releases the well-established Quercus L. trees. Success in afforestation requires planting high-quality seedlings using management practices that promote survival and growth. Restoration based on ecosystem processes, using tree species that have complementary ecological requirements, will be more successful and affordable than other methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - By means of the physical process-based modeling approach to computing coastal and estuarine hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, an integrated model system was developed to simulate tides, waves, currents, winds, sediment transport, and morphological changes in coastal and estuarine regions. This paper presents an overview of this integrated morphological process modeling system consisting of modules for simulating random wave deformations, tidal and shortwave-induced currents, sediment transport and morphological changes. The individual modules included in the integrated model system were validated by simulating hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes in laboratory experiments and field study cases. An example for model application to an estuary is presented to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in simulating comprehensive impacts of combined storm waves, typhoons (or hurricanes), river floods, sediment transport, and morphological changes in its coastal and estuarine area. This modeling system provides engineers and researchers with an efficient and effective numerical software package to facilitate better coastal erosion protection, flood and inundation prevention, coastal storm water management and infrastructure protection against hazardous storms, typhoons, and hurricanes.

AB  - Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS), comprising unique elements of geological, biological, and historical interest, is located on the central California coast approximately 60 km northwest of San Francisco. The National Seashore contains nearly 130 km of exposed and protected shorelines, spectacular coastal cliffs and headlands, lagoons, open grasslands, bushy hillsides, and forested ridges. Approximately 30 km of the shoreline are coastal-dune habitat that supports 11 federally listed species, including the threatened western snowy plover and the endangered plants Tidestroms lupine (Lupinus tidestromii) and beach layia (Layia carnosa). The San Andreas Fault, a right-lateral strike-slip fault, trends northwest along the northeastern side of the park. Tomales Bay, which is straight, long, narrow, and shallow, runs along the northeastern boundary of PRNS. The Bay, which fills the northwestern end of a rift valley at the intersection of the San Andreas Fault with the coastline, is approximately 20 km long, 2 km wide, and 6 m deep with mountainous terrain to the southwest and rolling hills to the northeast. Tomales Bay is one of the cleanest estuaries on the West Coast. In winter, approximately 17,000 to 20,000 shorebirds inhabit Tomales Bay and Bodega Bay, which lies directly to the north. At the head of Tomales Bay, the Giacomini Ranch comprises 563 acres of pastureland currently being used for grazing dairy cattle. After more than 50 years of operation as a dairy, the National Park Service acquired the Giacomini property with the intention to restore most of it and the nearby Olema Marsh to tidal wetland. Restoration will add approximately 4% to the existing coastal wetlands in California.

AB  - In intertidal areas of the Indo-West-Pacific, foraging soldiercrabs create a disturbed sediment surface covered with pseudofaecal pellets discarded during the feeding process. To investigate the impact of feeding activities of the soldiercrab Mictyris longicarpus (Latreille, 1806) on small infauna, field experiments were carried out in a tropical tidal flat of Northeast Australia. A comparison of meiofaunal abundances in undisturbed sediment and sediment deposited by soldiercrabs after flotation feeding indicated an uptake of certain meiofauna Laxa. Significantly reduced numbers of nematodes, copepods and plathelminthes were found both in the pseudofaecal pellets discarded by crabs foraging on the surface, and in the sediment deposited as hummocks by subsurface feeding crabs. Ostracods and newly settled bivalve larvae were not separated during flotation feeding. but discarded with the pellets. This indicated a sorting of food items by their specific density during the flotation feeding process. A caging experiment showed significant increases in the abundance of all meiobenthic Laxa when soldiercrabs were excluded. Mechanical disturbance of the sediment to simulate sediment scraping by the cribs had no impact on the meiobenthos. Foraging soldiercrabs are important predators on meiofauna and significantly modify the meiofaunal community in tropical tidal flats.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. “Ecological Infrastructure (EI)” are defined as naturally functioning ecosystems that deliver valuable services to people, such as healthy mountain catchments, rivers, wetlands, coastal dunes, and nodes and corridors of natural habitat, which together form a network of interconnected structural elements in the landscape. On the other hand, natural disaster occur at the locations where habitat was reduced due to the changes of land use, in which the land was converted to the settlements and agricultural cropland. Hence, habitat loss and natural disaster are linked closely. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is as important for providing services and underpinning socio-economic development. Hence, ecological infrastructure is expected to contribute to functioning as ecological disaster reduction, which is termed Ecosystem-based Solutions for Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR). Although ecological infrastructure already exists in the landscape, it might be degraded, needs to be maintained and managed, and in some cases restored. Maintenance and restoration of ecological infrastructure is important for security of human lives. Therefore, analytical tool and effective visualization tool in spatially explicit way for the past natural disaster and future prediction of natural disaster in relation to ecological infrastructure is considered helpful. Hence, Web-GIS based Ecological Infrastructure Environmental Information System (EI-EIS) has been developed. This paper aims to describe the procedure of development and future application of EI-EIS. The purpose of the EI-EIS is to evaluate functions of Eco-DRR. In order to analyse disaster data, collection of past disaster information, and disaster-prone area is effective. First, a number of digital maps and analogue maps in Japan and Europe were collected. In total, 18,572 maps over 100 years were collected. The Japanese data includes Future-Pop Data Series (1,736 maps), JMC dataset 50m grid (elevation) (13,071 maps), Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map (325 maps), Digital Base Map at a scale of 2500 for reconstruction planning (808 maps), Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area (10 m land use) (2,436 maps), and Digital Information by GSI (national large scale map) (71 maps). Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map were analogue maps, and were scanned and georeferenced. These geographical area covered 1) Tohoku area, 2) Five Lakes of Mikata area (Fukui), 3) Ooshima Island (Tokyo), 4) Hiroshima area (Hiroshima), 5) Okushiri Island (Hokkaido), and 6) Toyooka City area (Hyogo). The European data includes topographic map in Germany (8 maps), old topographic map in Germany (31 maps), ancient map in Germany (23 maps), topographic map in Austria (9 maps), old topographic map in Austria (17 maps), and ancient map in Austria (37 maps). Second, focusing on Five Lakes of Mikata area as an example, these maps were integrated into the ArcGIS Online® (ESRI). These data can be overlaid, and time-series data can be visualized by a time slider function of ArcGIS Online. </jats:p>

AB  - When the U.S. Coast Guard gave the historic Ocracoke Island Lifesaving Station to the State of North Carolina, and it became the North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching (NCCAT), the change represented real opportunity for improvement to the historic site. One particular improvement was the recovery of the eroding section of Pamlico Sound shoreline behind the facility where years of wind and wave action were chewing their way landward toward the buildings. In a collaborative effort with NCCAT, the North Carolina Coastal Federation, and the North Carolina State Construction Office, Moffatt & Nichol engaged in the complex task of permitting, designing, and constructing a natural estuarine shoreline and tidal marsh complex to replace the eroding shoreline, which had been unsuccessfully armored against the advancing sound. The restoration project involved the design and construction of breakwater sills just off shore to dissipate wave energy, regrading of the gradual slope of a natural shore profile, and re-establishment of native shoreline marsh vegetation. The design also involved additional green amenities. An interpretive boardwalk and pier were constructed and future construction phases will include stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) on upland areas, such as bioretention cells and pervious parking areas. In addition, oyster habitat restoration and seeding are planned for the site. Execution of the project also involved substantive opportunities for outreach and education by using teacher volunteers to implement the marsh vegetation plantings. Construction thus far has resulted in restoration of approximately 300 feet of natural shoreline and two acres of coastal salt marsh aquatic habitat. This case study presentation will review the complex permitting, design and construction issues involved in this highly public project built in a sensitive marine environment.

AB  - In the battle to preserve land against the ravages of the sea man has created many inappropriate protection structures on the coast. Often the coastline which is being protected is, inherently, in dis-equilibrium with nature. When combined with the increased recreational usage of the coastal zone, the rise in sea level and the increased incidence of storms, accelerated erosion rates are often the result. The Environmentally Friendly Coastal Protection project, or ECOPRO for short, developed a coastal erosion assessment method for the non-specialist. It devised a system for optimising erosion monitoring and developed a guide to select of an appropriate coastal protection response. The project results are contained in the ECOPRO Code of Practice. This 320-page guide explains the steps involved in assessing and monitoring coastal erosion problems, planning protective actions and evaluating their environmental impact. Prepared by the Offshore & Coastal Engineering Unit of Enterprise Ireland, it is the result of four years of work which was supported under the EU LIFE Programme and drew on expertise from Ireland, Northern Ireland and Denmark. This paper presents details of the project and the development of the Code.

AB  - Management of forest carbon (C) stocks is an increasingly prominent land-use issue. Knowledge of carbon storage in tropical forests is improving, but regional variations are still poorly understood, and this constrains forest management and conservation efforts associated with carbon valuation mechanisms (e.g., carbon markets). This deficiency is especially pronounced in tropical islands and low-lying coastal areas where climate change impacts are expected to be among the most severe. This study presents the first field estimate of island-wide carbon storage in ecosystems of Oceania, with special attention to the regional role of coastal mangroves, which occur on islands and coastal zones throughout the tropics. On two island groups of Micronesia (Yap and Palau), we sampled all above- and belowground C pools, including soil and vegetation, in 24 sites distributed evenly among the three major vegetation structural types: mangroves, upland forests, and open savannas (generally on degraded lands formerly forested). Total C stocks were estimated to be 3.9 and 15.2 Tg C on Yap and Palau, respectively. Mangroves contained by far the largest per-hectare C pools (830-1218 Mg C ...), with deep organic-rich soils alone storing more C (631-754 Mg C ...) than all pools combined in upland systems. Despite covering just 12-13% of land area, mangroves accounted for 24-34% of total island C stocks. Savannas (156-203 Mg C ...) contained significantly lower C stocks than upland forests (375-437 Mg C ...), suggesting that reforesting savannas where appropriate has high potential for carbon-based funding to aid restoration objectives. For mangroves, these results demonstrate the key role of these systems within the broader context of C storage in island and coastal landscapes. Sustainable management of mangrove forests and their large C stocks is of high importance at the regional scale, and climate change mitigation programs such as REDD+ could play a large role in avoiding deforestation of mangroves where this is a management objective.

These are the impacts of climate change and ocean change with "extreme" signs such as increasing storms, coastal floods, sea level rise, sea acidification, pollution and environmental incidents, ... occur thicker, more intense and irregular. Especially serious degradation of the environment and biodiversity of the sea, increasing environmental incidents, including oil spills, ... due to human impact. Especially the large-scale destruction of coral reefs, seagrass beds in island clusters off the South China Sea has been happening at a worrying rate. The destructive fishing activities of humans in the South China Sea have caused ecosystem degradation and the extinction of some species, such as sea turtles, some sharks and another species. Other fish, especially the giant mussel, the consequence is a decrease in the natural capital of the sea, leading too prolonged "ecological disturbances". The reserves of seafood in the Spratly region (of Vietnam) and the West Sea in the East Sea have decreased by about 19% compared to before 2017. Therefore, the improvement of marine environment quality, including biodiversity conservation and major marine ecosystems are to preserve marine natural assets, contributing to the implementation of Vietnam's green growth strategy and action plan. This is the path that Vietnam has chosen to both grow marine economy, adapt to climate change, and protect the environment both in the short and long term, towards sustainable development.</jats:p>

AB  - US Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) projects have reduced coastal vulnerability and helped communities anticipate and mitigate toward improved resilience. This study proposes the Coastal Resilience Index (CRI) to quantify storm damage reduction benefits due to beach restoration projects in the context of resilience. The CRI considers metrics of the beach and dune system and disturbance factors such as storm surge and waves, using five non-dimensional factors: Protective Elevation (PE), Volume Density (VD), Protective Width (PW), Crest Freeboard (CF) and wave run-up (WR). The CRI is the summation of these five non-dimensional factors. This study developed a geographic information systems (GIS) based tool to automatically extract morphologic features from historic profiles and profiles extracted from LiDAR data to quantify beach resilience over time. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - Due to the role of nutrients as limiting agents for eutrophication in fresh water and marine estuaries and as a human health risk in drinking water, greater scrutiny of land use in urban areas is needed. Few studies have attempted to determine the contribution of individual land uses to water quality degradation in urban areas. A 40% urban, 332 ha watershed in Ithaca, NY was selected as the research site. Runoff collected from 98 precipitation events over a two-year period and three land uses was analyzed for ammonium (NH4+-N), and nitrate (NO3--N) and mass losses were calculated. Monitored land uses included fertilized lawns (FL), urban barren (UB) areas and wooded (FR) areas. Stream gauges were installed at the stream entrance to the urban area and the watershed outlet to monitor the impact of the urban land uses on stream water quality. A multivariate analysis of the data revealed that the FL land use had significantly higher (p<0.05) nitrogen (N) loss than the other land uses in areas with shallow soil and high runoff potential. On the deeper soil where runoff was low, the FL land use had significantly lower (p<0.05) N loss than the UB or FR land uses. Precipitation derived N inputs had an influence on N lost from all land uses in the watershed, while N measured in throughfall under the FR land use canopy was of the same order of magnitude as the N lost in runoff from these areas. As the stream flowed through the urban area there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in stream flow rates under storm conditions and a significant decrease (p<0.05) in stream flow rates under dry conditions when compared to the undeveloped upper watershed. A really weighted N loads in the stream were as high, and in many cases, significantly higher (p<0.05), from the undeveloped upper watershed than following stream flow through the urban area. This indicated that the urban area may be a N sink. The results demonstrate that it is imperative to assess land use performance both spatially and under varying climatic conditions in order to reduce surface water contamination.

AB  - The lower Mississippi River encompasses the 1,535-km reach extending from the confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. Waters of the lower Mississippi River have historically inundated vast areas of adjacent floodplain during spring flood pulses. Additionally, processes of land building within the river's deltaic plain supported vast forests and diverse freshwater and salt-marsh habitats. Flood pulses provided a mechanism of lateral exchange of energy and nutrients between the aquatic and terrestrial habitats, while sediment loads continually rebuilt and supported the deltaic plain. As human populations and agriculture expanded throughout the lower Mississippi Valley, construction of flood-protection levee systems and commercial navigational structures severely decreased the connectivity between the lower Mississippi River and its floodplain. The current lower Mississippi River floodplain is more than 90% reduced in area compared to historical conditions. Fluvial dynamics, which are the driving forces that stimulate floodplain function and create diverse habitats, appear to have been altered throughout approximately 80% of the river. As a result, the hydrograph, thermograph, sedimentation patterns, nutrient dynamics, and vegetation communities within the lower Mississippi River floodplain have experienced major changes through time, with many large alterations occurring during the past century. In addition, because most of the sediment load of the lower Mississippi River now enters the northern Gulf of Mexico, land building and associated processes are much reduced in the river's deltaic plain. This process has allowed intrusion of saltwater into coastal habitats, which has heavily impacted vegetation communities. This paper reviews the consequences of river modification to lower Mississippi River floodplain, current efforts towards restoring the floodplain and deltaic plain, and proposes future strategies towards restoring portions of the historical floodplain.

AB  - The distribution, contamination status, and ecological risks of heavy metals in Tahaddart estuary were investigated. 24 surface sediment samples and two cores were collected and analyzed for major (Al and Fe), heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn), and grain size composition. The heavy metals assessment was carried out using different environmental indices. The results indicated that the spatial distribution patterns of Al, Fe, and Zn were mainly determined by the distribution of the finer grained fraction (<63 μm) in the sediment. In contrast, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb concentrations were controlled by anthropogenic activities (vehicular traffic from Highway Bridge and thermal power plant). The distribution of heavy metals in sediment cores showed an upward enrichment in heavy metals with high concentration found in the uppermost may related to the increasing in human activities. The pollution indexes confirmed that the Tahaddart estuary sediment was considerably to high contaminated by heavy metals near to different anthropogenic inputs. Similarly, the potential ecological risk index and the biological risk index present 21% probability of toxicity posing potential risk to the aquatic organisms. These results provide basic information that can be used to protect and improve the quality of this ecosystem.

AB  - During several years severe beach erosion was observed at the city of Conceicao da Barra in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The beach erosion is caused by a gradual increase in littoral sediment transport towards North, which has caused a shift in the direction of the net littoral drift. A new shoreline protection scheme was developed and tested. The scheme is based on two main principles: 1) - Create a number of sub cells in which the shoreline can attain its equilibrium orientation and 2) - Enhance the volume of sand in each cell in order to allow the natural shoreline dynamics due to cross-shore sediment transport.

AB  - Ocean View Beach is located in the transition zone in the estuarine environment of the lower Chesapeake Bay. It is a unique location, given that it is exposed to a fetch to the north in the Bay environment and an eastern exposure to swell from the Atlantic Ocean. In the past 10 years, northeast storms (nor'easters) and hurricanes have significantly impacted this shoreline, resulting in erosion and loss of the frontal dune system. In an effort to mitigate erosion, a nearshore breakwater field was constructed with a total of 258,000m(3) of sediment placed along a reach of 1.6 km. An intensive monitoring program was initiated in 2002 whereby surveys are performed biannually including: aerial photography, beach and nearshore surveys, and sediment sampling. A directional wave.-age was installed in close proximity to the study area in 2006. This investigation documents performace of recent engineering projects, provides a characterization of local coastal processes based on monitoring data collected (through March 2008).

AB  - During the past four decades, research efforts directed toward reducing shell egg cholesterol content have centred on genetic selection or alteration of the laying hens' diet with various nutrients, natural products, non-nutritive factors, or pharmacological agents. However, the vast majority of these experimental approaches elicited only minimal changes (<10%) at best or, as in the case of dietary azasterols and triparanol, resulted in the unacceptable replacement of yolk cholesterol by desmosterol. In contrast, when 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins'), garlic paste, or pharmacological amounts of copper were orally administered to chickens, yolk cholesterol levels were reduced by up to 46%, 32%, or 34%, respectively. The previous paper in this two-part series provided a justification for low-cholesterol egg production and reviewed cholesterol metabolism in the laying hen, avian embryonic cholesterol needs, and genetic and nutritional approaches to chicken egg cholesterol reduction. The present paper provides a comprehensive overview of the use of non-nutritive dietary factors and select pharmacological compounds as egg cholesterol-lowering agents, and discusses emerging strategies for lowering the cholesterol content of shell eggs. With the recent advances in avian genomics and transgenesis, it is anticipated that the greatest advances in the area of yolk cholesterol reduction will be attained through manipulation of key genes whose protein products mediate intestinal sterol absorption, hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein synthesis, and/or lipoprotein uptake by growing oocytes. However, the future commercial availability of low-cholesterol eggs produced by transgenic hens ultimately will be influenced by the nature of the regulatory environment for bioengineered foods, public acceptance, and economics. © World's Poultry Science Association 2007.

AB  - The Lake River Industrial Site (LRIS), owned by the Port of Ridgefield (Port) in Ridgefield, Washington, USA, was home to a wood-treating facility from 1964 to 1993. The wetland habitat of Carty Lake immediately adjacent to the LRIS was found to be contaminated with dioxins and other wood-treating chemicals, likely a result of discharge from former stormwater outfalls. To inform the design of the cleanup action, Maul Foster & Alongi, Inc. (MFA) applied incremental sampling methodology (ISM) in wetland sediments. The ISM results were used to focus the active remediation to a limited area. MFA designed, permitted, and provided oversight for implementation of the remedial action, which involved temporarily dewatering and excavating sediment from 0.6 hectare of wetland. Through both careful design and an extensive grading effort, the restored wetland surface retained the nuanced topography and "pocket-habitats" of the preconstruction conditions. An approximately 550-meter-long failing bulkhead was also permanently stabilized in place by the construction of bioengineered soil embankments. The design and implementation also included significant landscape components; the wetland, transitional zones, and upland areas of the site were completely revegetated with native plant communities to provide wildlife habitat, prevent erosion, and restore culturally significant plants to an area historically used by Native American tribes.

AB  - This study uses the Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to evaluate sea-level-rise hazards of erosion and inundation, on coastal archaeological sites in Trinity Bay, Texas. The SLAMM model was used to simulate the effects of a 1.5-m sea-level rise in the study area from 2006 to 2100. The model incorporated 177 archaeological sites, wetland categories, marsh accretion, wave erosion and surface elevation change. Modeling indicates that about 5,500 hectares of marshlands will undergo large-scale conversion to unvegetated tidal flats or open water by 2100. Both accretion and inland migration will be insufficient to prevent large-scale losses of marshlands. Predicted erosion, on a site-by-site basis, is expected to affect 31% of archaeological sites by the end of the century. Predicted periods of inundation of archaeological sites were derived from ten years of tide data from a nearby tide gauge station, using NOAA’s Inundation Analysis Tool. Approximately 55% of archaeological sites in the study area are predicted to be inundated at least half the time by the year 2100. Both inundation and erosion are predicted to have significant detrimental effects on archaeological sites in the study area. The study demonstrates that SLAMM is a useful tool for predicting potential future sea-level rise hazards on coastal cultural resources. Model outputs will be useful to coastal management agencies charged with evaluating impacts of sea-level rise and targeting high-risk sites for mitigation efforts.

AB  - The maintenance of marsh platform elevation under conditions of sea level rise is dependent on mineral sediment supply to marsh surfaces and conversion of aboveand belowground plant biomass to soil organic material. These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here, we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to aboveground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, aboveground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary, USA. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important tradeoff with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, aboveground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of belowground biomass as the root: shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Europe and many other countries all over the world are often surrounded by coastal defence systems (e.g. protective dunes and dykes) in order to protect coastal areas from threats of wave attack, storm surges and subsequent coastal floods. During moderate sea conditions, wave attack and coastal erosion is limited to nearshore areas and may only cause shore erosion. Under the same conditions, fresh groundwater, which is hydraulically interconnected with seawater, is in equilibrium with the laterally intruding seawaters. Such equilibrium prevails as long as the moderate sea level (MSL) and the hydrogeological conditions at the sea/land boundary are stationary. However, during extreme storm surges, the higher water levels may temporally threaten the coastal defence systems. In fact, shortwaves riding on the temporally rising sea level during storm surge events may directly runup, rundown and/or impact on barriers, possibly causing seaward erosion followed by lowering of barrier’s crest and hence wave overtopping or overflow through combined surge and waves. As a result, barriers may breach, inducing coastal inundation and subsequent vertical saltwater intrusion (VSWI) behind the breached barriers due to the vertical infiltration of inundating seawater into the fresh groundwater. In this study, a new integral physically based methodology is developed to reliably assess the possible implications of extreme storm surges on the safety of coastal barriers and the implications of possible breaching for contamination of coastal aquifers. The integral model is therefore capable to successively simulate breaching/overtopping of coastal barriers forced by storm surges as a hydraulic load, induced flood propagation in the hinterland and subsequent VSWI into coastal aquifers while considering the complexity of these processes and mutual interaction among them. The modelling methodology consists of an improved XBeach code (Roelvink et al., 2009) for hydro-morphodynamics unidirectionally coupled with the SEAWAT code (Langevin et al., 2008) for groundwater flow. The model is applied to a case study in northern Germany, showing that marine floods represent a serious threat to usability of coastal aquifers which are extremely important water resources. Outcomes of model application showed that a coastal flood event of a few hours may contaminate coastal aquifers for many decades, thus reducing the agricultural yield and hindering the sustainable development in coastal areas prone to coastal floods. This study represents, to the knowledge of the author, the first systematic research study that addresses the safety of natural coastal sandy barriers under extreme storm surge conditions together with the consequences of possible barrier breaching and overwash on subsequent flooding and saltwater intrusion into fresh groundwater. Moreover, it is probably the foremost study that attempts to mitigate storm-driven saltwater intrusion through the use and modelling of a subsurface drainage network. Besides improving the agricultural yield in coastal areas, the use of subsurface drainage network significantly reduces the natural remediation interval required for aquifers recovery after a coastal flood event. Moreover, it limits the vertical extent of the salt intrusion. The multiple flow domains and aspects discussed in this research make it a multidisciplinary study that is quite relevant for the coastal engineering community, for flood risk managers, for coastal hydrologists, for groundwater suppliers as well as for sustainable development planners. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - Erosion of exposed shorelines often introduces large quantities of sediment into the stored waters of stormwater retention basins. This additional sediment load can minimize the water quality enhancement otherwise gained from settling. Through the use of shoreline vegetation, it is possible to reduced this shoreline erosion and to achieve additional water quality benefits. (A)

AB  - The human history of coastal regions around the world has been under assault for decades, from forces that include dam building, coastal modifications, the destruction of wetlands, marine erosion, population growth and rampant development, looting, and other processes. Global warming will exacerbate the destruction of cultural resources in coastal zones through accelerated sea level rise, intensified storm cycles, and related coastal erosion. Although average global sea levels have been rising for ∼20,000 years, they slowed dramatically about 7,000 years ago. Rates of sea level rise now appear to be increasing rapidly due to growing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Global warming and rising seas, especially when combined with population growth and the implementation of measures designed to protect endangered coastal properties, threaten the deep maritime history of human migrations, settlement, and adaptations in coastal areas around the world. Ranging in age from the mid-Pleistocene to recent historic times, coastal archaeological sites contain invaluable data on ancient coastal societies, fisheries, and ecosystems. Archaeologists, historians, and other cultural resource managers must do more to anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of global warming, sea level rise, and coastal erosion on the long history of human maritime cultures.

AB  - <jats:p>The study of diversity and ecological-phytocenotic mapping of the vegetation cover was carried out at the key area located in the eastern part of the Echki-Dag mountain range in the territory of the Lisya Bay Reserve (Eastern Crimea). A generalization of the classification and ecological patterns of vegetation was carried out to create a legend for a large-scale ecological-phytocenotic cartographic model (at the scale of 1:10000). The ecological-geomorphological series and combinations of xerophytic and mesoxerophytic plant communities indicating erosion-denudation processes on different substrates of the underlying parent rocks were the thematic basis of the cartographic model. The developed legend is based on the units of vegetation of the association rank obtained using the Braun – Blanquet method combined into ecological series in accordance with their position on the gradients of the leading ecological factors as well as on the hierarchy of phytochories determined by the categories of erosion-denudation relief of coastal slopes. The resulting vegetation map demonstrates the main regularities of the regional phyto-diversity and serves as the basis for assessing the resource potential of vegetation, its landscape-stabilizing and nature conservation value.</jats:p>

AB  - Tuggerah Lakes are a barrier or wave-dominated estuary consisting of three interconnected shallow lagoons impounded by a coastal sand barrier. Sea level rose by about 120 m during the late Pleistocene to about present sea level at about 7900-7700 cal BP. Sea level continued to rise to +1.5 m by 7400 cal BP and persisted until about 2000 cal BP when it regressed to the present level. Throughout most of the early and mid-Holocene, Tuggerah Lakes had two entrances, one in Tuggerah Lake at The Entrance and another in Budgewoi Lake near Budgewoi. Sand completely blocked the entrance near Budgewoi and the remaining channel at The Entrance became ensconced on bedrock. Nevertheless, sandy flood-tidal deltas developed at both entrances, although currently inactive. Where rivers debouche into the lagoons, silt jetties or fluvial deltas have formed. Deep channels have been dredged through river-mouth bars, altering natural sedimentation patterns and the distribution of seagrasses. The geoheritage value of flood-tidal deltas and silt jetties needs to be determined for NSW estuaries so that the most significant can be protected appropriately. Copyright © 2013 IAHS Press.

Owing to the generally poor subsoil conditions, an intensive near-shore geotechnical Site Investigation (SI) campaign was carried out in order to determine the most appropriate breakwater typology. Core-barrel rotary drillings and CPTUs up to 50 m below the seabed were performed from a jack-up platform deployed from Europe to the work site specifically for this project. Water depth varies from 13.8 to 18.1 metres. Laboratory tests were also carried out on high-quality undisturbed samples. This paper presents the outcomes of the SI campaign and sets out the alignment with standard correlations for Quaternary submarine near-shore delta soils in Brazil.

AB  - The study site is located on the Gulf of Mexico and is part of the most valuable lagoon-estuarine system in Mexico, not only in ecological terms but also as an important economic and social site for the country. Although the current state of the environment is still reasonably healthy over much of its area, the natural equilibrium has been greatly affected by human activities, as in many of other coastal lagoons worldwide (e.g., infrastructure and building construction, installation of inappropriately designed defense structures, degradation of vegetation and an artificial lagoon opening). The consequence is a sediment deficit that, combined with the impact of tropical cyclones and the absence of an external sand supply, has led to persistent beach erosion. The analysis of the physical settings, historical shoreline changes and hydrodynamic patterns of the study site has helped to identify the critical elements affecting the current state of the beach. This paper proposes a shoreline protection scheme, based on the understanding of the current functioning of the site, in order to reduce local flooding and erosion risks, which affect the population and tourism, and to preserve the natural environmental services of the area.

AB  - Concerns about sea-level rise and nature conservation led to a shift from hard engineering to more sustainable management approaches. Managed realignment (MR) is increasingly popular in Europe, especially in England where projects often have multiple aims, including: intertidal habitats creation, improved flood risk management and more affordable coastal defences. This article discusses whether MR is a sustainable strategy able to deliver the expected environmental and socio-economic benefits in England. Assessing the sustainability of MR is problematic, as data on projects' performance are scarce, of restricted dissemination and limited in scope and geographic coverage. Additionally, projects lack well-defined targets against which their performance can be evaluated. The few existing independent studies indicate a number of constraints including: reduced biodiversity in small realignment sites; new saltmarsh development at the expense of established habitats; poor ecosystem services provision; and lack of understanding about the effects of MR on hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes. There is little evidence so far that MR in England is achieving its strategic aims. Realignment sites are usually small, confined by new defences and located within or adjacent to designated conservation areas, where conflicts arise as designated freshwater habitats might be destroyed to give place to intertidal habitats. As sea level continues to rise, it is just a matter of time for coastal squeeze to affect the newly created intertidal habitats. Only through a coherent, long-term and national strategy that truly integrates planning, flood management and conservation objectives, MR will be able to deliver the expected benefits. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Much is known about wave attenuation across sandy nearshore environments or coral reef platforms. Limited field work has aimed to measure and assess attenuation across rock platforms. We designed and implemented a field experiment at Belinho, Portugal, to address this need. Field work was conducted in June, 2006, over a sequence of five tidal cycles. We deployed a shore-normal array of seven KPSI pressure transducers, installed 0.15 m above the bed and spaced between 10 and 15 m apart, to measure surface water levels. When all instruments were submerged by the rising tide, they were sampled at 20Hz. The instrument array spanned the inter-tidal platform composed of schist. The surface, about 70 m wide, is irregular and cut by many shore perpendicular channels. To assess the attenuation and transformation of waves across this surface as a result of shoaling and breaking, we derived spectral estimates of wave height and period through each high tide series. Wave heights at the outermost PT ranged between about 0.4 to 0.9 m. At the innermost PT, corresponding values were 0.5 to 1.14 m. Wave periods averaged about 10 s through the study. Our results showed that a breaking criterion of 0.42 + c fit our data.

AB  - The French organization of onshore oil spill response is defined by specific intervention plans (Polmar plans), established for every coastal department. One of the main elements of these plans consists of detailed plans for deploying booms to protect sensitive areas. The Ministry of the Sea, with assistance from CEDRE, carries out exercises every year in different coastal locations to test the feasibility and efficiency of the boom deployment plans and also to train local personnel in handling antipollution equipment. Lessons learned from these exercises enable the improvement of deployment plans and help define new research areas. Within this framework, CEDRE has undertaken a feasibility study for the installation of booms in high tidal range and strong current areas. This experimental study involved a 15-day period, during the autumn of 1993. of on-site observations on the behavior of booms installed in one of the most difficult sites on the Atlantic shoreline. The main parameters observed were resistance, containment efficiency, and mechanical behavior of booms during the tide cycle, particularly when booms are stranded at low tide. In spite of successful boom installation, the experiment encountered difficulties due to meteorological and instrumentation problems. Nevertheless, important lessons have been learned. Static boom protection seems to be difficult for such sites, which leads us to question the validity of numerous Polmar plans. We should test alternative response techniques such as dynamic recovery systems set up at the openings to sensitive areas, which will necessitate good coordination between at-sea and on-shore response authorities. Mooring systems design and installation are jobs for specialists and should be prepared in advance. Various local means, such as fishing vessels or oyster farm barges, can be used for deploying protective booms.

AB  - Accurate evaluation of wave run-up on beaches is a critical issue for coastal flooding studies. During extreme events, the maximum wave run-up, caused by very long (frequently non-breaking) waves, may exceed the crest of the coastal protection structures or dunes and inundate the protected inland area. This event may be simulated by a flood propagation model, recently published by the authors, that solves a simplified form of the Shallow Water Equations (SWE). The simplification mainly consists of linearizing bottom friction and neglecting advection. This study investigates on the relevance of the latter terms and on the model ability in predicting wave run-up on impermeable beaches. Numerical simulations of run-up induced by solitary non-breaking waves on a gentle-sloping planar beach are compared to the results found by Synolakis (1987) on the basis of an experimental study. For the numerical simulations, only 21 tests of the 40 experiments carried out by Synolakis (i.e. all the non-breaking waves) are considered. A good agreement between the numerical and the experimental maximum runup was found for all the tested waves. In order to verify the magnitude and the effects of the advection terms in the SWE, some simulations are repeated considering and neglecting this term. The hypothesis of neglecting convective terms is found appropriate.

AB  - Isles Dernieres is a transgressive barrier island arc in southeast Louisiana associated with the Bayou Grand Caillou headland of the Lafourche delta complex, which was abandoned 600 to 800 years ago. During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the go...

AB  - To assess coastal storm risks, this article compares existing hazards, associated risks, coastal management plans, and civil protection schemes from nine European countries. An evaluation made of specific study sites concludes that: the definition of coastal hazard or risk varies between countries, regions and sites with no pan-European agreement; existing risk definitions for northern Europe are based on probabilistic approaches and integrate threats to human occupation; this approach is not adopted in southern and eastern European countries; half of the evaluated coastal management plans have a scientific basis with the remainder adopting qualitative or semiquantitative approaches; strategic approaches, used to define areas of potential occupation, coastal defences etc. are the most common; operational approaches used for major event prediction and response are poorly developed. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate existing best practices in Europe, in order to develop standardised coastal risk management for all EU member states.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2014 Conference Start Date: 2014, Sept. 14 Conference End Date: 2014, Sept. 19 Conference Location: St. John's, NL, Canada The collapse of the Atlantic cod fishery in the 1990s devastated the economies of many coastal Newfoundland communities. While many have survived through a combination of a much reduced fishery, government funding, and off shore or out of province employment, none of these are sustainable long-term solutions. Sea-based aquaculture ("fish farming" in pens) has provided stable employment in some areas, but only where there are suitable sites with protected, deep inlets with significant tidal or river current flushing. These geographic characteristics are not usually compatible with prosecuting the inshore fishery. Sites that were close to the open fishing grounds with minimal near shore currents were prized by the small boat fishers, but wind and wave protection were a secondary concern. Thus there are many towns and villages that are significant distances from ideal sea-based aquaculture sites. While shore-based aquaculture would be possible in many coastal villages, the profitability of the industry is limited by the cost of pumping water to and through the shore based infrastructure. Many existing coastal settlements do have an abundance of energy available in ocean waves. The harnessing of this energy to pump water on shore at low cost will enable the development of profitable shore based aquaculture methods that will provide sustainable long-term economic activity for these communities. Shore-based aquaculture has the additional possibility of containing and directing effluent from the production on one species to another that can use it as a feed source (e.g., fish effluent delivered to filter feeders). This effectively "biofilters" the fish production effluent while producing other marketable product (scallops and seaweed, for example) at little or no extra cost. This paper reports on a research project being conducted by College of the North Atlantic (CNA) in Lord's Cove, Newfoundland, which has the overall goal of developing a sustainable land-based aquaculture system utilizing wave energy. Development of the pump is occurring concurrently with the design, installation and commissioning of a pilot cascaded Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) facility in Lord's Cove. In this pilot farm, the effluent from the finfish (the only organisms receiving external feed input) is directed to sea urchin production tanks. From there, water flows to scallop production tanks and finally algae culture. The algae produced is fed to the urchins, who consume this and organic sediment coming from the finfish. The suspended organic particulate in the urchin effluent will nourish the sea scallops, and the algae will reduce the dissolved inorganic load before the water is returned to the ocean (Fig. 1). Until the wave pump development is complete, water for the farm is being entirely supplied by electric pumping. We are currently undergoing scale model and sea based prototype testing of the wave driven pump. As part of the design process for this pump, the wave energy resource and bathymetry at the site was measured and documented. As a result of these activities, CNA now operates the Wave Energy Research Centre (Fig. 2). This facility is now permitted for testing of wave energy absorbers and similar devices: it includes data acquisition (wave environment, weather and device performance monitoring) as well as the necessary infrastructure to support these studies and is ready to host other device developers.

AB  - Coastal dunes can protect communities and infrastructure against storm surge and wave attack. They provide a natural barrier of granular material that erodes during storm conditions and dissipates wave energy in the process. Vegetation is abundantly present in most coastal dunes and may enhance the capability of the dune to withstand erosion. However, reliable data allowing quantification of the erosion process of dunes are sparse, in particular, data involving live plants. In this study, physical model experiments in a moveable-bed wave flume were carried out to investigate the effect of live plants on the wave-induced dune erosion process. The dune grass Sporobolus virginicus was grown in pots with dune sediment, transplanted into test dunes and subjected to both regular and irregular wave attack. Measurements of hydrodynamics and profile evolution show that the vegetation does affect the eroded dune volume and the dune scarp retreat rate. During wave flume testing vegetation density ranged from 0 to 80 plants per square meter and plant maturity (i.e. age) was varied between 0 and 12 weeks but further tests are necessary to substantiate the observed trends. The maturity of the plants’ root system yielded the most significant impact on dune erosion as plants with more developed roots were able to reduce the eroded dune volume more than plants with less mature root systems.

AB  - Because of the large volumes of sand required for beach renourishment, dredging from offshore borrows is the preferred method of sediment supply. As easily accessible and previously known (obvious) deposits are exploited, apparent sand reserves are seen as a dwindling resource that becomes more precious over time. Because economically exploitable offshore sand sources are limited in many regions, renewed efforts are underway to locate additional offshore sand sources that can supply sand and mixed sediments (sand, silt, and clay) to barrier-island restoration efforts in Louisiana. Sediment volumes required for beach renourishment and marsh restoration are variously estimated on the basis of numerous assumptions to range in the extreme from 14 × 106 m3 to 71 × 106 m3, respectively, for one complete restoration of the entire barrier island chains. Although estimates of required volumes are controversial, significant new borrow sites must be located on the continental shelf off Louisiana to restore the barrier islands. The search for new sand sources must be focused on logistical procedures that are economical and efficient in order to cover large areas of the shelf in a timely manner. Sand search protocols developed for US East Coast sedimentary environments are broadly applicable in a conceptual sense but need to be adapted to deltaic coastal frameworks in Louisiana. Procedures and protocols for the Delta Sand Search Model (DSSM) are thus based on bathymetric, geophysical, and geotechnical survey recommendations for the identification of targets that will be proven out by detailed studies and cultural resource investigations. Development of a DSSM has advantage because it is specifically adapted to coastal marine morphosedimentary units in different-aged lobes of the Mississippi Delta that have fine-grained (muddy) deposits interspersed by sandy deposits of paleodistributaries and interdistributaries.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) recently estimated that global sea level will rise from 0.18 to 0.59 m by the end of this century. Rising sea level not only inundates low-lying coastal regions but also contributes to the redistribution of sediment along sandy coasts. Over the long term, sea-level rise (SLR) causes barrier islands to migrate landward while conserving mass through offshore and onshore sediment transport. Under these conditions, coastal systems adjust to SLR dynamically while maintaining a characteristic geometry that is unique to a particular coast. Coastal marshes are susceptible to accelerated SLR because their vertical accretion rates are limited and they may drown. As marshes convert to open water, tidal exchange through inlets increases, which leads to sand sequestration in tidal deltas and erosion of adjacent barrier shorelines.

AB  - A three-year study (July 1974 to July 1977) of Price Inlet, South Carolina, monitored inlet hydraulics and channel morphology. The inlet is strongly ebb-dominant. Both the peak and mean current velocities during ebb exceed the corresponding velocities during flood. The velocity asymmetry is caused by changes in inlet efficiency during the tidal cycle. The intertidal-marsh of the Price Inlet drainage area experiences a change in open water surface area of about 670 percent during an average tidal cycle. At high tide, the large water surface of the marsh is responsible for inefficient exchange of water through the inlet. During the study period, the growth of the linear bars in the channel margin gradually reduced wave energy along the inlet shoreline and on the inner ebb-tidal delta platform. This in turn reduced sediment transport into the inlet, which resulted in a gradual increase in the cross-sectional area of the channel. Seasonal fluctuations in mean sea level appear to have little effect on the inlet channel.

AB  - Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke) operates the Dillsboro Hydroelectric Project under a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC No. 2602). The Project is located on the Tuckasegee River in southwestern North Carolina in the Town of Dillsboro, Jackson County. The development consists of a small reservoir of limited storage (15 acres in size), dam and powerhouse, and a small amount of adjacent shoreline land. Duke has proposed to surrender the License and subsequently remove the dam and powerhouse as part of Settlement Agreements addressing continued operation of Duke's East Fork and West Fork Projects, as well as the Nantahala Project. This Settlement Agreement was signed by Duke, along with 20 of the 22 stakeholders including all the pertinent state and federal agencies and filed with FERC in January 2004. The removal of the dam would provide mitigation for fish passage at the aforementioned projects and instream flow relief at specific bypassed reaches within the East Fork, West Fork, and Nantahala Projects. The dam removal would allow full aquatic and recreational access to an additional 9.5 miles of river and ultimately restore 4,220 feet of the river to its original condition and elevation. FERC stated in their Surrender Order that the Project would have short-term environmental impacts, significant environmental benefits, and would be in the public interest. However, this potential success story is not without its regulatory, environmental, and engineering challenges. Before the dam and powerhouse are removed, several environmental conditions needed to be addressed and state and federal permits obtained. Foremost of these challenges was the location of several populations of federally endangered mussels immediately downstream of the dam. Before the dam is removed, Endangered Species Act (ESA) section 7 approval by the USFWS was required before the mussels could be relocated upstream to a suitable site. Other environmental challenges include removal of 70,000 cubic yards of sediment from the impoundment (of a total of 100,000 cubic yards) and the associated state dredging permit approval. In addition to the FERC surrender order, section 401 water quality certification, several section 404 nationwide permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a NPDES permit, and several years of pre-removal monitoring are also required before the dam can be removed. With the removal of the powerhouse, over 500 little brown bats are to be removed and relocated to nearby constructed bat boxes. Engineering challenges include the staged removal of a cyclopean concrete dam, removal of the Powerhouse, sediment removal, bank stabilization, and an immediately adjacent and potentially affected State road, fiber optic cable, and sewer line. There have been several legal challenges associated with the removal of the dam. Three years of postremoval monitoring are also required by the agencies and is a condition of the section 2 401 certification. In spite of these challenges and conditions, the dam and powerhouse are currently slated to be removed in January 2010. © 2009 Omnipress.

AB  - This article summarizes the body of work that describes the regional evolution and stratigraphic architecture of the Pontchartrain Basin. The northern two-thirds of the basin is underlain by a stratigraphy of undifferentiated sands and clays deposited throughout the Plio-Pleistocene by glacially influenced rivers. These deposits were weathered and incised by rivers during sea-level low stands, forming a series of terraces that increase with age from south to north. The southern third of the basin is composed of estuaries formed during the Holocene, while shoreline processes created a series of sandy barriers that restricted communication to the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River completed the geologic development of the basin by building a sequence of subdelta lobes along this southern margin over the past 5,000 years, further sealing it from the open Gulf of Mexico. Presently, the modern Mississippi River bypasses the estuarine environment and only contributes sediments during flood events when the river overtops the levee system.

AB  - Europe has recently faced several major industrial accidents generated by various causes. They have led to a lot of casualties and major damages to the environment (Enschede 2000, Toulouse 2001, Atli 2004...). Moreover, after the 9/11th people have stressed the influence of terrorism in the emergence of new risks. Geopolitical context has brought about risks which cannot be completely avoided. It is illustrated by many events: Sarin Attack, Anthrax Letters, USS Cole and Limburg attacks, drinking water contamination, action on industrial sites...Regarding SEVESO establishments and similar critical infrastructures like ports and marshalling yards, these concerns are not included in the safety report required by the Authorities. in this paper, the authors establish, in the first part a brief inventory of the available methodologies and tools in order to elaborate a threat assessment. Then in the second part, they formulates some suggestions to integrate security aspects in a risk assessment, to globalise prevention and response approach in case of chemical accident or intentional acts on chemical sites. An example of the adaptation of the ARAMIS methodology is explained in the last part.

AB  - Projected rates of global sea level rise and human pressures have increased attention to the potential for landform change in estuaries. This paper assesses the status of the fetch-limited beaches in the Tagus estuary, one of the largest estuaries in Europe, with a focus on distinguishing active beaches from inactive vegetated banks and identifying conditions under which they change state. A total of 26 beaches were identified in the inner estuary and 49 in the tributary basins on 2007 aerial photographs and compared with conditions on older photographs (1944-1958). Lengths, widths and maximum fetch distances for beaches were measured and site visits were made to determine their origins and present conditions. Beaches occur at eroding uplands or marshes or on spits extending from eroding uplands. Human-created beaches occur on spoil areas, within niches formed by structures and where vegetation is eliminated or prevented from colonizing (e.g. boat launches and recreational surfaces). Basin infilling, with increase in the elevation of low tide terraces and the formation of bars, is reducing wave energies, and some beaches are reverting to vegetated banks. Beaches that become vegetated banks because of human actions occur where use for boating or recreation is abandoned and where spits that form off spoil deposits reduce fetch distances upwind.

AB  - This paper evaluates a pioneering sediment recharge in the Orwell estuary (eastern UK), along a degraded mud-gravel foreshore backed by a seawall protecting agricultural land. Recharge was undertaken in December 1997 and involved placement of a retaining bank of potentially mobile gravel, which was filled with 22 x 10 super( 3) m super( 3) muddy maintenance dredgings. Morphodynamic behaviour of the mud and gravel deposits over a 10 year period has been dominated by in situ dewatering and compaction of the mud, landward reworking of the enclosing gravel, and partial return of the mud to the wider estuarine system. Landward roll over of the gravel has reduced the width of the newly created mudflat by around 60%, such that this is now only 15 to 25 m wide. This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct placement of cohesive dredge material on low wave energy estuarine foreshores as a means of reducing damage to flood defence infrastructure and restoring degraded mud flat and saltmarsh habitats over a decadal timescale.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have disproportionately high carbon densities, known as blue carbon, compared to most terrestrial ecosystems. Mangroves and their blue carbon stocks are at risk globally from land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) activities such as aquaculture, alongside biophysical disturbances such as sea-level rise and cyclones. Global estimates of carbon emissions from mangrove loss have been previously unable to differentiate between the variable impacts of different drivers of loss. This article discusses the impacts that different LULCC activities and biophysical disturbances have on carbon stocks (biomass and soil) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4). The dynamics of carbon stocks and fluxes depends on the type of LULCC; aquaculture often results in biomass and soil carbon removal, and some forms of agriculture can substantially increase methane emissions. Natural disturbances have mixed impacts on mangrove carbon; sea-level rise will drown some mangroves and their carbon stocks but provide opportunities for new carbon accumulation, while cyclones can have immediate negative impacts on stocks but positive impacts on sequestration during recovery. Mangrove rehabilitation practices can actively restore carbon stocks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from previous land uses. It is critical to consider the type of LULCC when estimating carbon emissions due to mangrove loss or rehabilitation. Mangrove blue carbon is now high on the international conservation policy agenda, and a better understanding of how carbon stocks and fluxes respond to anthropogenic and biophysical disturbance may provide better incentives for mangrove conservation and sustainable management.

AB  - The tidal River Elbe, northern Germany, serves as an important international waterway feeding the port of Hamburg and thus indicates its function as a significant economic lifeline for that region. At the same time the estuarine riverscape is a valuable natural habitat, protected by national and European legislation. In recent centuries the estuary has been impacted by manmade changes, e.g. by ongoing river training. There are very limited data about the dynamic interaction between soils, sediment transport and budgets as well as vegetation development. This article compiles ongoing Elbe research that includes: (i) the response of tidal reeds and invasive plants to shifts in hydrodynamics and land use; (ii) the resilience of bank sediments against hydro-mechanical stress; and moreover (iii) the analyses of socio-economic aspects in the context of bank restoration by applying the approach of ecosystems services.

AB  - <jats:sec> <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>In March, 1981, Amoco Production Company constructed an exploration drilling pad on No Name Island, a natural barrier island located 14 miles northeast of Prudhoe Bay in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. A monitoring program was initiated at No Name Island to determine the nature and extent of island change in response to the natural environmental forces active at the site. Two field surveys were conducted during the 1981 open-water season, the first in July and the second in September. Additionally, historical survey records and aerial photographs were investigated to determine long-term processes of island change.</jats:p> <jats:p>The most significant changes observed between July and September, 1981, include island migration, island coalescence, and shoreline fluctuation. Although partially sheltered on its northern side by Cross Island, No Name Island exhibited changes similar to those observed on other Arctic barrier islands having more exposed locations.</jats:p> <jats:p>At least two episodes of island breaching occurred between 1979 and 1981. The largest breach occurred near the northern end of the island and measured 300 feet in width. A smaller breach near the island midpoint has partially healed as a result of filling by littoral drift.</jats:p> <jats:p>Between 1979 and 1981, No Name Island migrated southward at an average rate of 75 feet/year. On a long-term basis, the southward migration between 1949 and 1980 averaged 60 feet/year. The net littoral drift accounting for the observed long-term rate of migration is estimated to be approximately 50,000 cubic yards/ year.</jats:p> <jats:p>Shoreline fluctuations adjacent to the drilling pad between July and September, 1981, measured 10 to 15 feet on both the east and west shores. These fluctuations were accommodated within the 30-foot wide beach-front margin which was specifically avoided as a site for the drilling pad foundation due to its unstable nature.</jats:p> <jats:p>The recent history of No Name Island indicates the potential for dramatic short-term changes in both island shape and location. Cognizance of the major natural processes at work, provided by the monitoring program, will promote the proper design of future operations on the island while preserving the integrity of the island's natural environment.</jats:p> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title> <jats:p>During the early months of 1981, Amoco Production Company constructed a drilling pad on No Name Island, a barrier island located approximately 14 miles northeast of Prudhoe Bay, Beaufort Sea, Alaska (Figure 1). No Name Island constitutes the southern component of the accurate Cross Island barrier complex and, unlike most of the barrier islands in this region, is oriented in an approximate north-south direction. Over the 4000 foot length of the island, the island profile varies from a minimum elevation of less than one foot and a minimum width of 20 feet at its northern extremity, to a maximum height of approximately five feet (above mean sea level) and a maximum width of 350 feet near its southern shore.</jats:p> </jats:sec> </jats:sec>

A large number of highresolution TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images of five test areas along the German North Sea coast were acquired in 2012 and 2013 and form the basis for the present investigation. Depending on the type of sediment, but also on the water level and on environmental conditions (wind speed) exposed sediments may show up on SAR imagery as areas of enhanced, or reduced, radar backscattering. The (multi-temporal) analysis of series of such images allows for the detection of mussel beds, and our results show evidence that also single-acquisition, multi-polarization SAR imagery can be used for that purpose.

AB  - <jats:sec> <jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>The UK East Midlands oil reservoirs are thin estuarine sands of low porosity and permeability (1–3 mD) which are normally pressured and produced by pumping. Faulting and the presence of impermeable areas and sand discontinuity has reduced the water-flood recovery efficiency and limits the scope for enhanced recovery although a considerable quantity of oil remains in place. The paper describes the approach taken to identify potential areas for additional oil recovery and describes tracing work initiated to prove continuity and examine channelling. A critical examination of enhanced recovery techniques in terms of East Midlands conditions is presented and schemes for pilot operations based on viable techniques are presented. These schemes include both multiwell pilotsand single well operations.</jats:p> <jats:sec> <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title> <jats:p>Although Western Europe's major oilfields lie offshore, small quantities of oil are extracted from onshore European reservoirs. In the United Kingdom, BP has been producing oil from oilfields situated in the East Midlands since 1939.These oilfields are located in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, with the fields lying on a north-south trend paralleling the River Trent (Figure 1, Location Map). Most of the fields are in an advanced stage of depletion and some have already been abandoned (see Table 1). Current total production from the area amounts to some 1500 bopd. Before abandoning field areas it is essential to extract as much oil as possible from each reservoir, within economic and technical constraints.</jats:p> <jats:p>The East Midlands Additional Oil Project (EMAOP) was instigated early in 1979 with the twin aims of extending the producing life of these oilfields and of testing techniques of additional oil recovery.</jats:p> <jats:p>The operational experience gained will in most cases be applicable elsewhere- in some cases offshore.</jats:p> <jats:p>"Enhanced Oil Recovery" is the term generally applied to techniques other than pressure maintenance or water-flooding which are used to recover further oil from a reservoir depleted of its natural energy. It is also applied to techniques used to recover oil from a reservoir containing a viscous crude which will not naturally flow into a wellbore. The scope of the EMAOP is deliberately broader than this, and includes extensive field reviews, further individual well stimulations, improvement of water-flood efficiency inappropriate areas and enhanced recovery.</jats:p> </jats:sec> </jats:sec>

AB  - As climate change accelerates the dynamism of natural processes, its impacts are likely to be most keenly felt in the coastal zone where littoral communities may face an increasing risk of both erosion and flooding. As a response to climate change the primary mechanism on a geopolitical scale has been one of mitigation, as an attempt to reduce the anthropogenic causes at its root. However, perceived limitations of this approach led Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to agree in Bali, 2007 that the alternative approach of adaptation should play a significantly greater role in the future global response, and this is now embedded as one of the post 2012 pillars. There is evidence of adaptation already taking place but this is currently piecemeal in nature, with research showing distinct challenges and barriers to its introduction. Nevertheless, enhanced vulnerability facing coastal communities requires novel solutions to enable its implementation, thus allowing for a more strategic approach to ensure that timely and effective measures are taken, and to ensure coherence across different sectors and levels of governance. The research presented in this paper is concerned with exploring the capacity of coastal areas to adapt to change in terms of policy, spatial planning and development options, and is geographically focussed on the Solent. This estuarine complex is an area of coast likely to be particularly vulnerable to coastal change since it is densely populated, low-lying and highly contested by a range of competing interests. It is also likely to include specific areas defined as Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMAs) that will not be protected by any new measures; hence requiring communities to adapt. The paper will outline an EU Interreg IVa - 2 seas funded project entitled 'Coastal Communities 2150 and Beyond' (CC2150), and in particular its application in the Solent. On the basis of vulnerability and coastal risk, this project is aimed at informing communities of predicted climate change impacts in order that they might be empowered to find proactive responses to the problem of coastal change. Central to this is the need to communicate science and build capacity within coastal areas, so as to enable effective planning, the conclusions of which are horizontally transferrable to other vulnerable areas of the UK coast and beyond.

AB  - The purpose of this field study was to evaluate bioremediation and phytoremediation in restoring an oil-contaminated freshwater shoreline. Weathered Mesa light crude oil was released intentionally onto small plots in the upper intertidal zone of a study site located along the St. Lawrence River. Treatments were established to examine the effect of nutrient addition and the role of plants (Scirpus pungens) on the removal of oil constituents from the contaminated plots. Fertilizers under evaluation included sodium nitrate, prilled ammonium nitrate, and triple super phosphate. Composite core samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 weeks for identification of remaining oil constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To account for differences because of physical washout, all oil constituents were normalized to the conservative biomarker hopane. Although bioremediation and phytoremediation treatments achieved slightly better degradation of hydrocarbons than natural attenuation, no statistically significant evidence of stimulation through addition of nutrients or biodegradation enhancement by vegetation was observed. After 21 weeks, reduction of target parent and alkyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) averaged 32% in all treatments. Reduction of target alkanes was of similar magnitude. The pattern of disappearance of hydrocarbons was characteristic of biodegradation: namely, the lower molecular weight alkanes declined to a greater extent than the higher carbon-number alkanes, as did the lower molecular weight PAHs compared to the higher molecular weight PAHs. Since there was little evidence supporting enhancement of biodegradation by nutrient addition with and without vegetation, it was concluded that oxygen limitation most likely dominated the persistence of oil hydrocarbons on the oil-contaminated plots.

AB  - This work aims at analysing the relative impact of sedimentary supply by rivers versus the effect of sea level rise and other processes over the last 5 decades of some representative coastal stretches of New Caledonia. The study of twelve coastal estuarine stretches has shown erosion rates ranging from -1.8m/y to accretion rates up to 5.5m/y over the last 50 years. During this time, the climate component of sea level rise has been evaluated around 0.5mm/y in Noumea and can be considered identical on the studied island. Vertical movements affecting New Caledonia are suspected to be different between western and eastern parts of the island. Nevertheless, in areas with homogeneous vertical movement, the coastal stretches studied show various evolution rates. The analysis of accreting estuarine coastal areas shows that this evolution is linked to sedimentary supply from rivers. On New Caledonia Island, the creation of bare soils by nickel mining during the last 50 years has increased erosion processes on the watersheds, and the solid discharge of the rivers.

AB  - Smooth-shelled blue mussels of the genus Mytilus have long been a major focus of research because such mussels have an interesting global (antitropical or bipolar) distribution, have a complex phylogeographic history, are ecosystem engineers, are economically important as an aquaculture product, are very successful as bioinvaders, hybridise readily both naturally and after accidental introduction, and have a complex and still incompletely resolved taxonomy. Historically, most research has been focussed on Northern hemisphere mussels, and investigation has spanned a range of different methodological approaches that have set the foundation for our current understanding of the global situation. However, research into native blue mussels in the Southern hemisphere has tended to lag behind that in the Northern hemisphere. The result has been that native Southern hemisphere mussels have often been viewed only in the perspective of their Northern hemisphere congeners. Recently, however, the application of new molecular markers - single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs - has substantially improved our understanding of the taxonomy of Southern hemisphere blue mussels, their biogeography and indirectly their evolutionary histories. Based largely on new SNP surveys of native and non-native blue mussels from all major Southern hemisphere regions, we highlight the need for recognition of distinct species that are consistent with a large body of evidence, both SNP-based and other, and can be understood in the context of Southern hemisphere oceanography. We also highlight with the new SNPs-based data the ongoing difficulty of agreeing on what constitutes a distinct species by emphasising different interpretations of the data, and discussing how the use of species delimitation models may remove some of the qualitative assessment that is so often applied to the problem. The recognition of new species has implications for management, including the identification of bioinvasive mussels, the conservation of native genetic diversity, aquaculture production statistics, food labelling and traceability.

AB  - In April 1986, more than 50,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Bahia las Minas on the central Caribbean coast of Panama, oiling reef flats, seagrasses, coral reefs and mangroves. In August 1986, we began a five-year study on the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) fringe and the plants and animals that live attached to submerged prop roots. This habitat forms an important part of nearshore, tropical nursery grounds. In three habitats (wave-washed open shores, channels and lagoons, and interior drainage streams), oil initially coated virtually the entire surface of submerged prop roots and sank more than 20 cm into sediments. Secondary re-oiling was heaviest in sheltered drainage streams where oil continuously leached from sediments, but also occurred on the open coast and in channels. Bivalves in channels and streams were heavily contaminated through at least May 1991. Results show this spill was a chronic source of oil contamination rather than a single point-source event. The epibiota of submerged mangrove roots had not recovered completely in any habitat after five years. Independent of this reduction, the structure of the mangrove fringe significantly changed after oiling, including decreases in the amount of shore fringed with mangroves and in the density and size of submerged prop roots. Overall, the surface area on submerged mangrove roots decreased by 33 percent on the open coast, 38 percent in channels and 74 percent in streams. The combination of chronic re-oiling, damage to epibiotic assemblages, and reductions in the biogenic substrate (submerged prop roots) has decreased the productivity of this tropical nursery area and suggests recovery will be a complex and prolonged process.

AB  - Conference Title: 2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS) Conference Start Date: 2016, Aug. 8 Conference End Date: 2016, Aug. 11 Conference Location: Shanghai, China In terms of seeking the characteristics of wave propagation many engineering infrastructures can be regarded as a waveguide due to their distinguished physical properties in contrast with the natural surroundings. Coastal protection dykes can be treated as such a waveguide. Taking this as the conceptual model we try to seek the signature of the voids or defect weak spots inside the dyke or in the underlying formations on the guided elastic and electromagnetic waves. We studied the effects by first looking into numerical simulations. The numerical tool is the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We simulated both the elastic wave in two-dimensional P-Sv fashion and the electromagnetic (EM) wave in TMz mode. Simulations of the elastic wave in P-Sv fashion is for mimicking the propagation of the seismic Rayleigh wave in the waveguide; whereas simulations of the TMz mode is for mimicking the propagation of the ground penetrating radar (GPR) wave in the waveguide defined by the dyke. Given the commonly used geophysical tools for engineering non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) as the reference, we modeled the elastic wave with a source impulse central frequency of 100 Hz, and the EM wave source impulse of 100 MHz. Both waves have a similar wavelength in 1–2 meters; while the target defect zone size is also at meter scale with a depth of up to 10 meters. Preliminary results in numerical simulations suggest that significant feature changes can be generated by the existence of the defects. The simulation results are validated by field observations with known exist defect zone in a segment of the costal dyke.

AB  - Abstract. Sedimentary organic matter (OM) analyses along a 130 km-long transect of the Mkhuze River from the Lebombo Mountains to its outlet into Lake St. Lucia, Africa’s most extensive estuarine system, revealed the present active trapping function of a terminal freshwater wetland. A combination of organic bulk parameters, thermal analyses, and determination of plant waxes, and their corresponding stable carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δD) isotopic signatures in surface sediments and local plant species enabled characterization and comparison of sedimentary OM in terms of stability, degradation status, sources, and sinks within and among the respective sub-environments of the Mkhuze Wetland System. This approach showed that fluvial sedimentary OM originating from inland areas is mainly deposited on the floodplain and Mkhuze Swamps. In contrast to samples from upstream areas, a distinctly less degraded signature characterizes the sedimentary OM in the northern section of Lake St. Lucia. Although lake sedimentary plant waxes are similar in the observed wax distribution pattern and δ13C values, they exhibit considerably higher δD values. This offset in δD indicates that lakeshore vegetation dominates plant-derived sedimentary OM in the lake, elucidating the effective capturing of OM and its fate in a sub-tropical coastal freshwater wetland. These findings raise important constraints for environmental studies assuming watershed-integrated signals in sedimentary archives retrieved from downstream lakes or offshore.

AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes. © 2019 Geraldi, Ortega, Serrano, Macreadie, Lovelock, Krause-Jensen, Kennedy, Lavery, Pace, Kaal and Duarte.

AB  - Recent field studies at five oil spill sites where mangroves were affected provide a broad base of information on the response of mangrove communities to oiling. Three study sites in Florida (two in the Florida Keys, one in Tampa Bay) and two in eastern Puerto Rico were visited in 1978, 1979, and 1980. At each site, impacts on mangroves were assessed by the compartmental method, which rises statistical comparisons of ecological parameters between impacted and comparison stations and produces an array of biological and geomorphic data sets that allows spill sites to be compared. Despite many differences in the size of the spills and the spill sites, the responses of the oiled-mangrove communities were similar in terms of tree mortality; leaf defoliation. deformation, and stunting; seedling deformation and mortality; lenticel expansion; adventitious growth of pneumatophores; and changes in the density and distribution of plants and animals. Each spill site differed mainly in the magnitude of the stress response. Observations of the spills showed that differences in the physical environment, such as the degree of exposure to waves and currents and geomorphic features like the terrain, greatly influence the distribution and persistence of oil within different mangrove forest types. From these studies, mangrove forest types can be ranked by their predicted sensitivity to oil. This differentiation in ranking increases the value of the Environmental Sensitivity Index, especially where it is desirable to assign priorities in a campaign to protect oil-sensitive habitats from oil spills along mangrove-dominated coastlines.

AB  - A simple numerical model demonstrates that the reduction in turbulence due to stratification greatly enhances the trapping of suspended sediment that occurs at the estuarine turbidity maximum. In moderately and highly stratified estuaries the turbulent diffusivity decreases markedly between the region upstream of the salinity intrusion, where the turbulence is uninhibited by salt stratification, and the stratified regime within the salinity intrusion, where turbulence is reduced by the inhibitory influence of salt stratification. This reduction in turbulent diffusion results in a reduction in the quantity of sediment that can be carried by the flow, causing sediment to be trapped near the landward limit of the salinity intrusion. This trapping process occurs at the same location as that due to the estuarine convergence, but it appears to be many times more effective at trapping silt-size particles. A model is formulated that is similar to Festa and Hansen's (1978) model of the estuarine turbidity maximum, with the addition of a stratification-dependent eddy diffusivity. For silt-size sediment particles, the model indicates as much as a 20-fold increase in the trapping rate with inclusion of the stratification effect. it is likely that this mechanism is important in many partially mixed and highly stratified estuaries. © 1993 Estuarine Research Federation.

AB  - <jats:p>It could be concluded that tidal coastal zones contain high level of micro-minerals in soil and plants. Paradoxically, local goats inhabiting in this particular ecosystem are deficient in Fe, Cu and Mn. This might be an adaptive response of animals in that area. Tanins are well-known inhibitor of Fe absorption from intestine. Regular consumption of tanins and other plant alkaloids during grazing and browsing might also be responsible for low bio-availability of the minerals in the plasma. Further research is warranted to have more insight on mineral status of small ruminants in fascinating ecosystem of Sundarbans.</jats:p>

AB  - It is here presented the results of a study of the phytosociological and plant landscape of Mount Cofano Natural Reserve (Custonaci, Trapani) together with a cartographic representation to a scale of 1:10000 (reduced to a scale of 1:20000). The studied area is localised along the western side of Sicily island and it is spread out for 537,5 ha, dominated by Mt. Cofano rocky promontory (659 mts.), regarded as one of the most interesting biotopes of the regional territory linked to its floristic, zoological and environmental features. From a geolithological point of view, the area is characterized by carbonathic substrata relative to Monte Sparacio-Monte Cofano and Monte Speziale-Monte Palatimone Units. Bioclastic calcarenites and conglomerates of arenitic type are present at the borders of the area. The most diffused pedological soil associations are lithosols (Lithic Xerorthents), rock outcrop (Rock Outcrop), "Terre rosse mediteranee" (Lithic Rhodoxeralfs) and "Suoli bruni" (Typic Xerochrepts). From a bioclimatic point of view, the whole territory is included in the (lower) thermomediterranean upper dry belt, but the northern part of Mt. Cofano, above 450 mts. altitude, is to be referred to the (lower) thermomediterranean upper suhumid belt. In order to give a good interpretation of sigmeta and microgeosigmeta of the natural landscape, the syndinamic relationships between several series of vegetation are discussed as well as the ecological, floristic and structural-physiognomic characters of the plant communities. The climatophilous series are the following: - coastal Sicilian, basophilous, of calcarenites, thermomediterranean dry series of kermes oak (Chamaeropo humilis-Querco calliprini sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous and umbrophilous, of detrital slopes, thermomediterranean dry series of holm oak and termophilous deciduous species (Rhamno alaterni-Querco ilicis pistacietoso terebinthi sigmetosum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous and heliophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry-subhumid series of holm oak and Pistacia lentiscus (Pistado lentisci-Querco ilicis sigmetum); - hilly Sicilian, neutroacidophilous, of leached calcareous soils, mesomediterranean subhumid series of holm oak and strawberry tree (Pistacio lentisci-Querco ilicis arbutetoso unedonis sigmetosum). The edaphophilous series are the following: - coastal Tyrrhenian, basophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of dwarf palm (Pistacio-Chamaeropo humilis sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, basophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of wild olive (Rhamno-Euphorbio dendroidis euphorbietoso bivonae sigmetosum). The microgeosigmeta of maritime cliffs, rocky slopes, detrital slopes and temporary ponds are also presented. Some new syntaxa referred to Crithmo-Limonietea (Limonietum bocconei subass. limonietosum bocconei and subass. helichrysetosum cophanensis), Crataego-Prunetea (Clematido cirrhosae-Rubetum ulmifolii subass. calystegietosum sylvaticae and subass. rhoetosum coriariae), Cisto-Micromerietea (Brachypodio ramosi-Cistetum cretici), Scrophulario-Helichrysetea italici (Sedo sediformis-Centranthetum rubri) and Quercetea ilicis (Pyro amygdaliformis- Calicotometum infestae, Pistacio lentisci-Quercetum ilicis subass. arbutetosum unedonis) classes are described. © Societè Italiana di Scienza della Vegatazione.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We present data on the colonization of Middleton Island, Alaska, by Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) following the creation of an extensive rocky intertidal zone after the Alaskan earthquake of 1964. The first pair of oystercatchers was detected in 1976, and it was another 5 years before the population increased to three pairs. Oystercatcher numbers increased steadily thereafter, with a population explosion occurring in the 1990s. By 2002, there were 171 territorial pairs on the island. The total number of birds increased from two in 1976 to 718 in 2002. Breeding-pair densities on Middleton Island are the highest recorded for any portion of Alaska, averaging more than 5 pairs per km of shoreline in 2002. Nesting success in 2001 and 2002 was greater (83% or more of the eggs laid hatched) than that reported for any other population of oystercatchers in Alaska or along the Pacific Coast. We attribute this exponential growth rate and exceptionally high reproductive success to the large area of available and suitable habitat, the low number of avian predators and the complete lack of mammalian predators, low rate of nest loss to high tides and storm surges, and a low level of human disturbance. We propose nominating Middleton Island as a regional Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site because a high percentage of the world's and region's population of Black Oystercatchers resides there during the breeding season. Further, since Middleton Island may be the single most important site in Alaska for Black Oystercatchers, we suggest it be protected from future development.</jats:p><jats:p>Colonización, Crecimiento Poblacional y Éxito de Nidada de Ostreros Negros Luego de un Movimiento Sísmico</jats:p><jats:p>Resumen. Presentamos datos sobre la colonización de la Isla Middleton, Alaska, por el Haematopus bachmani, luego de la creación de una extensa zona intermareal rocosa como resultado del terremoto ocurrido en 1964.

Desde entonces los números de ostreros crecieron constantemente con una explosión de la población ocurrida en los 1990s. En 2002 había 171 parejas territoriales en la isla. El número total de individuos aumentó de dos en 1976 a 718 en 2002. Las densidades de parejas reproductivas en la Isla Middleton son las más altas registradas en cualquier lugar de Alaska, promediando más de 5 parejas por km de costa en 2002. El éxito de nidada en 2001 y 2002 fue mayor (83% o más de los huevos depositados eclosionaron) que el informado para cualquier otra población de ostreros de Alaska o de la costa Pacífica. Atribuimos esta tasa de crecimiento exponencial y el excepcional y alto éxito reproductivo, a la gran superficie con hábitat adecuado disponible, al bajo número de aves predadoras y a la completa ausencia de mamíferos predadores, a la baja tasa de perdida de nidos por mareas altas u oleaje por tormentas, y al bajo grado de disturbio humano. Proponemos la nominación de la Isla de Middleton como Sitio Regional de la Red Hemisférica de Reservas para Aves Playeras, dado el elevado porcentaje de la población mundial y regional de ostreros negros que allí residen durante la temporada reproductiva. Además, dado que la Isla Middleton podría ser el sitio más importante de Alaska para Haematopus bachmani, sugerimos que debería ser protegida del desarrollo en el futuro.</jats:p>

AB  - In a changing climate, coastal zones are increasingly susceptible to coastal hazards. In South Africa this is exacerbated by growing pressure for coastal frontage development. Hence, the recognised, urgent need to better control and manage development in the coastal zone. A formal guideline in this regard, is the development of coastal set-back lines to ensure new development is protected from coastal events and slower, climate driven changes. Authorities concerned over potential hazards in the coastal zone are now thinking of how to determine and implement risk set-back lines. This article presents the stepwise process arrived at, to determine such a risk set-back line for KwaZulu-Natal. The process is simple, cost-effective and considers three key factors; historical shoreline change, sea-level rise and coastal vulnerability. For this study, three set-back line lifespans where considered; 25, 50 and 100 years. This time range allows for both long-term management and short-term understanding of coastal risks and vulnerability.

AB  - The Lerma marshes maintain a high diversity impacted and damaged by industrial and urban development of the Valley of Toluca. The changes, exchanges and the systematic transitions of land use occurred in the marshes between 1973 and 2008 were evaluated and related to the current diversity of aquatic vegetation. We use correspondence analysis to visualize the distribution of the dominant flora and the type of plants prevalent in each wetland. Transformation processes vary spatially and temporally in each marsh, but the general trend is the loss of open water areas and cattail marshes, which tend to transform into lands of low flood with hydrophytes of smaller size and adapted to disturbance, later these fields are replaced by farmland and urban spaces. The rate of destruction of wetlands was most intense from 1973 to 1989, but remained in 2008. The expansion of agricultural and urban areas has displaced flood areas, causing negative effects on diversity and structure of aquatic vegetation in the marshes.Original Abstract: Las cienegas de Lerma son areas de alta diversidad impactada y deteriorada por el desarrollo industrial y urbano del Valle de Toluca. Los cambios, intercambios y transiciones sistematicas de uso de suelo ocurridos en ellas entre 1973 y 2008, se evaluaron y relacionaron con la diversidad de la vegetacion acuatica que aun conservan. Se visualizo la reparticion de la flora dominante y el tipo de plantas que prevalece en cada humedal mediante analisis de correspondencia. Se revela que los procesos de trasformacion varian espacial y temporalmente en cada cienega, pero la tendencia mas generalizada es la perdida de zonas de agua abierta y tulares, las cuales tienden a transformarse en zonas de baja inundacion que favorece una flora hidrofita de menor talla y adaptada a los disturbios, que posteriormente es sustituida por campos de cultivo y eventualmente por espacios urbanos. El ritmo de destruccion de los humedales fue mas intenso de 1973 a 1989, pero aun se mantenia en 2008. La expansion de areas agricolas y urbanas ha desplazado a las areas inundables, causando efectos negativos sobre la diversidad y estructura de la vegetacion acuatica de las cienegas.

AB  - <jats:p>Wetlands are being considered increasingly important for wastewater treatment because of the ability of many wetland plants to absorb large amounts of nutrient and a variety of toxic substances. The paper highlights the physical, chemical and biological processes which contribute to the improvement of water quality, and the distinction between natural and constructed wetlands. The impacts of long-term wastewater disposal on the biotic changes, reduction in treatment efficiency, and wetland processes such as production of trace gases, are pointed out. Constraints in using wetlands, for wastewater treatment, such as poor understanding of the natural wetland functions and responses of native plants and animals to wastewater, particularly in developing countries, are briefly discussed. It is suggested that while the possibilities for using constructed wetlands based on native species for small communities are explored, greater emphasis should be laid on the restoration of lost and degraded wetlands, especially the river floodplains, lake littorals and coastal wetlands, which can help check pollution from non-point sources.</jats:p>

AB  - Increasing stress from global warming, sea level rise, acidification, sedimentation, pollution, and unsustainable practices have degraded the most critical coastal ecosystems including coral reefs, oyster reefs, and salt marshes. Conventional restoration methods work only under perfect conditions, but fail nearly completely when the water becomes too hot or water quality deteriorates. New methods are needed to greatly increase settlement, growth, survival, and resistance to environmental stress of keystone marine organisms in order to maintain critical coastal ecosystem functions including shore protection, fisheries, and biodiversity. Electrolysis methods have been applied to marine ecosystem restoration since 1976, with spectacular results (Figures 1(a)-(c)). This paper provides the first overall review of the data. Low-voltage direct current trickle charges are found to increase the settlement of corals 25.86 times higher than uncharged control sites, to increase the mean growth rates of reef-building corals, softcorals, oysters, and salt marsh grass- an average of 3.17 times faster than controls (ranging from 2 to 10 times depending on species and conditions), and to increase the survival of electrically charged marine organisms-an average of 3.47 times greater than controls, with the biggest increases under the most severe environmental stresses. These results are caused by the fundamental biophysical stimulation of natural biochemical energy production pathways, used by all organisms, provided by electrical stimulation under the right conditions. This paper reviews for the first time all published results from properly designed, installed, and maintained projects, and contrasts them with those that do not meet these criteria.

AB  - Out of many experimental applications of the 'Coastal Protection and Nourishment System' (CPNS), a soft shore protection arrangement, the one installed in June 1998 at the beach of Kato Loutro, Prefecture of Corinthia, will be evaluated in respect to the system stability, integrity, general environmental impacts, beach protection effectiveness, and longevity, on the basis of recent field survey results after 13 years (June 1998 to April 2011) of operation. Previous evaluations of other CPNS experiments published in 1998, 2000, and 2003 are found to be comparable to the ones exposed here. The present evaluation is based on direct site measurements made recently after the above time-period, during which no maintenance was made and provides conclusive evidence that the beach treated, is protected against many undesired impacts, i.e., erosion, coastline recession and seabed changes that may render unfriendly the use of the beach. The types of eroding beaches that can be treated and protected by installing this arrangement are discussed, together with comparative comments with other soft shore protection methods.

AB  - Alnus maritima (seaside alder) occurs in wet or flooded soils on the Delmarva Peninsula (southern Delaware and adjacent counties of eastern Maryland, USA) and in small niches in Georgia and Oklahoma. Although some A. maritima exist in coastal estuaries, responses of the species to salt, and whether salt resistance depends on provenance of plant origin, are not known. We first compared salt injury among A. maritima from all provenances irrigated with dilutions of ocean water. Seedlings from the three provenances responded similarly. Salinity up to 3.1 g/kg did not alter stem elongation but did cause increases in the ratio of dry to fresh weight of basipetal leaves, which reflected their necrosis. Photosynthesis and growth after treatment with salt then were compared among A. maritima and four other woody species: Baccharis halimifolia, Ceanothus americanus, Myrica cerifera, and Cornus amomum. Irrigation solutions with up to 12 g/kg salinity had no effect on B. halimifolia and caused no visible damage to M. cerifera. Ceanothus americanus showed foliar necrosis and decreases in photosynthesis at 3, 6, and 12 g /kg. Photosynthesis of A. maritima and C. amomum was sustained after irrigating with solutions at 3 g/kg but was reduced by 6 and 12 g/kg salinity. Our third experiment showed a more pronounced decrease in photosynthesis as salinity increased for A. maritima with roots partially or totally inundated in solutions with salt compared to plants irrigated but not inundated with these solutions. Lastly, symptoms of salt injury among A. maritima planted at locations that differed in salinity along the Broadkill River, an estuary in Delaware, were found to be similar to those we documented among plants treated in a greenhouse. We conclude that necrosis of basipetal leaves is the most apparent symptom of injury caused by salt in the root zones of A. maritima, that low concentrations of salt can lead to damage, and that the rate at which symptoms develop in this riparian species varies with the extent of root-zone inundation with salt water. Alnus maritima was less sensitive than C. americanus to salt but was considerably more sensitive than B. halimifolia and M. cerifera.

AB  - The mesoscale behaviour of unusual barrier inlets on the east coast of South Africa is described. The inlets are associated with river-dominated estuaries and are consequently subject to periodic closure during low river flow. The larger catchment river was not deflected by coastal progradation but maintained its position by periodic breaching of a channel through the barrier during floods. Flood breaches reseal by landward reworking of ephemeral deltas, and may undergo limited migration. A tidal inlet at the northern end of the barrier is maintained by a small tidal prism and has a flood-tidal delta. It exhibits limited lateral migration and closes occasionally, when wave-generated sediment transport filling the channel overcomes the flushing ability produced by tidal currents and freshwater discharge by the river. Large swell waves and the development of a washover channel cause the occasional breaching of the barrier, creating an ephemeral inlet midway along the barrier. The position of this breach is likely controlled by wave refraction patterns.

AB  - The population density and activity of a microbial community associated with the sediment and rhizosphere of an intertidal freshwater wetland dominated by Scirpus pungens was monitored before and following the application of weathered Mesa light crude oil and fertilizers. The influence of nutrient enrichment (fertilizers) and plant growth on oil degradation rates was determined from the resulting data. The study plots (four blocks of replicates) were subjected to five treatments: oil only (natural attenuation); oil plus ammonium nitrate and phosphate, with regular cropping of the plants; oil plus ammonium nitrate and phosphate; oil plus sodium nitrate and phosphate; no oil, ammonium nitrate and phosphate. The plots were regularly monitored in the field for gas production (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide), and samples were collected for laboratory analysis of denitrification activity, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation activity, and total heteroptrophic bacteria. The viable bacterial population density increased during the first 4 weeks in oiled and unoiled experimental plots that were fertilized. In contrast, population densities in untreated areas remained relatively unchanged throughout the monitoring period. The microbial population demonstrated a rapid and sustained increase in naphthalene mineralization activity in plots that were both fertilized and oiled. Hexadecane mineralization activity increased in response to fertilizer application, with ammonium nitrate causing a larger increase than sodium nitrate. A very significant difference observed in the mineralization of hexadecane was that the surface sediments were much more active than the subsurface sediments. This difference became even more pronounced in the second year of monitoring, even though the treatment regime had been discontinued. This compartmentalization of mineralization activity was not observed for naphthalene. Following fertilizer application, field and laboratory evaluation of nitrogen metabolism in the sediments indicated significant denitrification activity that was not adversely affected by oiling. The results demonstrated that the application of fertilizers stimulated the activities of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading and denitrifying bacteria, and the presence of oil either enhanced or had no detrimental effect on these activities. As a remediation strategy, the application of fertilizers to a wetland shoreline following an oil spill would promote the growth of indigenous plants and their associated microbial flora, resulting in increased metabolic activity and the potential for increased oil degradation activity.

AB  - Banksia littoralis (Proteaceae) inhabits winter-wet locations and wetland fringes that are prone to seasonal flooding events on the Swan Coastal Plain. To survive in these locations, B. littoralis seedlings must be able to tolerate periods of flooding or complete submergence if establishment is to be successful. Flood tolerance was assessed in seedlings of B. littoralis subjected to 104 days of continual soil waterlogging by comparing changes in seedling growth and leaf ecophysiology with those of well-watered plants. Flood tolerance was also assessed in seedlings of Banksia prionotes, a species that grows in drier locations on the Swan Coastal Plain. As expected, B. prionotes was unable to survive long periods of soil waterlogging or submergence (97% mortality after 72 days of flooding). Both species responded to flooding by closing their stomates and reducing photosynthetic capacity, although B. littoralis was able to recover lost photosynthetic potential when flooded conditions subsided. After 72 days of flooding, there was a substantial decrease in relative growth rate in flooded B. prionotes seedlings, compared to that of well-watered plants, although this was not associated with significant differences in biomass allocation. Flood-affected B. littoralis seedlings were significantly smaller than well-watered seedlings after 72 days of flooding, but were the same size after 104 days. Flood tolerance enables B. littoralis seedlings to survive exceptionally wet winter-spring months when flooding events are more likely to occur, although surviving the annual summer drought may be more important to sustain seedling establishment. © Royal Society of Western Australia 2004.

AB  - Coastal Louisiana's built and natural environment faces risks from catastrophic tropical storms. Concurrently, the region is experiencing a dramatic conversion of coastal land and associated habitats to open water and a loss of important services provided by such ecosystems. Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) engaged in a detailed modeling, simulation, and analysis exercise, the results of which informed Louisiana's 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. The Master Plan defines a set of coastal risk-reduction and restoration projects to be implemented in the coming decades to reduce hurricane flood risk to coastal communities and restore the Louisiana coast. Risk-reduction and restoration projects were selected to provide the greatest level of risk-reduction and land-building benefits under a given budget constraint while being consistent with other objectives and principles of the Master Plan. A RAND project team, with the guidance of CPRA and other members of the Master Plan Delivery Team, developed a computer-based decision-support tool, called the CPRA Planning Tool. The Planning Tool provided technical analysis that supported the development of the Master Plan through CPRA and community-based deliberations. This article provides a summary of the Planning Tool and its application in supporting the development of Louisiana's Master Plan. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A report by the British Department of the Environment calls for research into the effect of a rise in world temperatures on sea levels. Model studies should investigate changes in the pattern of coastal erosion and deposition, as well as the effect of new coastal defences, and the potential incursion of salt water into freshwater resources should also be evaluated. This paper addresses the later problem as it pertains to increased saltwater intrusion into rivers due to higher sea levels and lower upland discharges, caused by the greenhouse effect. (A)

AB  - In the past decades, the crest height of the seawall was determined by the allowable average wave overtopping rate q. Franco (1994) concluded that individual wave overtopping，particularly the maximum individual volume, provided a better design method than q, considering the stability of the seawall and the safety of vehicles and people along the coastal area protected by the coastal defense structures. Shanghai, located on the west bank of the Pacific Ocean, is quite sensitive to the risk of storm surges and violent wave overtopping. The typical seawalls in Shanghai are generally equipped with crown-walls shown in Figure 1. The crown-wall serves as an engineering measure to reduce the wave overtopping effectively. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.

AB  - The Tyrrehnian coast of Calabria (Italy) has been affected by erosion in the last thirty years. Between the resorts of Belvedere and Amantea, for more than 80 Km, one of the principal Italian railways line, the national road no 118 and many built up area that behind the beach alternate, suffered many damages during the years. From 1980, many protection works were realised to maintain the emerged beaches and to protect the structures and the infrastructures that lay behind. Some of the interventions went successfully, some were ineffective, some even increased the down-drift phenomena, some are still waiting to reach a final satisfactory configuration. Four interventions at Paola - San Lucido, Amantea, Belvedere - Bonifati and Cetraro were realised or are under construction. They are described and analysed to outline the learning from the activity carried out over twenty years of coastal designs and realisations.

AB  - The city of Bragança, which has more than 45, 000 inhabitants living on an area of approximately 16km2, is one of the oldest colonial settlements of the Amazon region. Over the past few years, several serious sanitation problems have become apparent. This study describes the effects of wastewater discharge originating from the city on the water quality of the nearby Caeté Estuary and its tributary the Cereja River, which passes directly through the city centre. Both rivers receive large amounts of wastewater disposed by private households, hospitals, workshops and fish processing companies. Surface samples of river water from the Cereja (station 1) and the Caeté (station 2) were collected bi-monthly in Niskin bottles between April 2006 and February 2007. Water samples contained high concentrations of nitrites, nitrates and phosphates, as well as high concentrations of chlorophyll a. Elevated counts of fecal coliforms (>1100 MPN/100mL) indicated microbial contamination. In the Caeté Estuary, dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll a concentrations, and bacterial counts declined during the months of highest rainfall, probably due to dilution effects. In the Cereja, by contrast, the highest concentrations of nutrients were recorded during the rainy season, when the river flooded and began to receive sewage directly from clandestine outfalls and other material from the lixiviation of surrounding areas. Clearly, the Cereja River is a source of contamination for the Caeté Estuary, in particular during the rainiest months of the year. Installation of basic sanitary facilities by local governmental authorities could mitigate the contamination of river water in Bragança.

AB  - The facilities of the PTP (Petro Terminal de Panama) consist of an 80-mile long, 36-inch pipeline and two marine terminals. The Pacific facility consists of three shore-based terminals to handle tankers from Valdez, Alaska. The Atlantic terminal contains two single-point moorings to load tankers destined for U.S. ports along the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to the opening of the pipeline, the government of Panama contracted for a series of studies designed to better understand the shoreline sensitivity, marine resources, archaeology, and limnology along the pipeline route and adjacent to each terminal. Results of the shoreline sensitivity analysis indicate that, by far, the Atlantic terminal in the Laguna de Chiriqui is the most sensitive and likely to be damaged during a spill. The laguna has almost no tides, is relatively stagnant, and is dominated by mangroves (51 percent of the total shoreline). In contrast, the Pacific terminal contains much higher tides and currents and fewer mangroves [44 percent of the total shoreline, but less than 5 percent within 30 miles of the terminal]. In response to environmental concerns and greatly supported and advised by the pipeline user companies, PTP completed a workable spill-response plan, developed along three fronts: the active and continuing purchase of spill-response equipment for use at the marine facilities as well as in fast-moving streams; the creation of specially trained spill-response teams; and the delegation of clear lines of authority for both land and marine spills. The interrelated roles played by Panamanians, the people of PTP, and the pipeline user companies provide an example of how different groups can cooperatively work together to protect the environment and still maintain financially advantageous, oil-related projects in a lesser-developed country.

AB  - Land reclamation is a complex marine environmental engineering and has a huge impact on social, economic, and physical environment. Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REIA to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of REIA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000.Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20%-30% along the western coast in the Lingdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally. More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.

AB  - <jats:p>Governmental programmes and international agreements to counteract eutrophication have largely not attained agreed goals (e. g. reduction by half of the anthropogenic nitrogen load on Swedish coastal waters and to the Baltic Sea). One explanation to the fact that the goals are not achieved yet might be that the most effective building blocks to counteract diffuse pollution are far from being fully implemented. It is therefore important to stress the potential in some very effective measures and find ways to fully implement them in a strategic way at the watershed level. To avoid overdoses of fertilizers in crop production is very important since overdoses lead to an exponential growth in the leaching magnitude. Field experiments indicate that the use of winter crops or an undersown catch crop outside the main cropping season has cut back the nitrate losses with up to 75% in a single year and close to 50% during a longer period of successive years. In southern Sweden, the area of wetlands has been decreased considerably (more than 90%) by melioration activities. In a recent project, mass balances in full scale restored ponds, verified the importance of ponds and wetlands in nitrogen retention. Per unit area, increased nitrogen loading implied increased nitrogen retention, but often a decreased retention percentage. Sedimentation of organic material must be favoured in order to obtain adequate conditions for denitrification. To achieve the governmental goal in nitrogen load reduction, proper agricultural practices must be combined with restoration of ponds/wetlands.</jats:p>

AB  - Geoscientific and geoarchaeological studies carried out at the ancient harbour site of Kyllini (western Peloponnese, Greece) revealed distinct evidence of repeated tsunami landfall. Located in the westernmost part of the Peloponnese, the Kyllini harbour site is situated at a narrow stretch of coastal lowland along the northeastern edge of Cape Kyllini. Directly exposed to the Ionian Sea and the Hellenic Trench, the harbour holds a considerably high risk for tsunami events and thus represents a valuable geo-archive for palaeotsunami research. While the inner harbour basin is merely preserved as a near-coast swamp, partially submerged installations like moles, quays, breakwaters and towers clearly define the outer harbour basin. Geoscientific studies carried out at the Kyllini harbour site comprised on-shore and coastal vibracoring, sedimentological, geochemical and microfossil analyses of the recovered sediments as well as electrical resistivity measurements. The overall geochronological framework is based on radiocarbon dating of biogenic material and age determination of diagnostic ceramic fragments. The stratigraphical record of the harbour site reveals an autochthonous pre-harbour marine embayment on top of Pliocene bedrock. Following a first high-energy impact, a coastal lake was established that was subsequently used as harbour basin and fortified by man. Following a period of siltation, the harbour sequence is abruptly overlain by a massive layer of coarse grained marine sand, indicating a sudden high-energy impact to the harbour site. Partly preserved as geoarchaeological destruction layer and post-depositionally cemented, the layer forms beachrock-type calcarenitic tsunamites. Our results suggest that the harbour site of Kyllini was affected by two tsunami events. A first event occurred between the late 7th and early 4th cent. BC prior to the harbour foundation while it seems as if at least parts of the harbour basin were later destroyed by a second tsunami event between the 4th and 6th cent. AD.

AB  - Rising seas increase the exposure, vulnerability, and thus the risk associated with storm surge flowing across the coastal floodplain (Passeri et al. 2015). This is especially true across low-gradient coastal landscapes such as Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. The extent and depth of flooding will be exasperated over the long term by morphologic changes to the shoreline, dunes and barrier islands (Plant et al. 2016, Passeri et al. 2016), marsh evolution (Alizad et al. 2016, Kidwell et al. 2017, Morris et al. 2016), and land use and land cover changes (Bilskie et al. 2014 & 2016). This presentation will describe how to incorporate biogeophysical impacts of climate change into future tide and surge models. A methodology will be presented (Bilskie et al. 2018) to down select a suite of synthetic storms from recent flood insurance studies to force hurricane storm surge models that represent present day and future changes to the coastal landscape under four sea level rise (SLR) scenarios of low (0.2 m), intermediate-low (0.5 m), intermediate-high (1.2 m), and high (2.0 m). Results of peak storm surge are used to compute the 100-year and 500-year return period floodplain and stillwater surge heights for each SLR scenario. Details on the vast new regions that become part of the 100- and 500-year floodplains by the end of the century will be discussed. Comparisons and contrasts with present day return period stillwater floodplains will be drawn. For example, throughout most of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, the present day 500-year return period event, in terms of inundation area and volume, becomes a 100-year event with just 0.5 m of SLR. Results indicate the need to take a system of systems approach to assess the coastal dynamics of sea level rise. The system of systems approach used herein and future enhancements to it will be elaborated. Transdisciplinary outcomes from this research are helping plan and prepare for the effects of SLR across the northern Gulf of Mexico and other low-gradient coastal landscapes (DeLorme et al. 2016). The importance of the involvement of stakeholders from across the northern Gulf of Mexico throughout the duration of the project will be highlighted. Finally, how the stakeholder involvement is worked into the system of systems approach will be discussed. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.

AB  - <jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ecological resilience of the intertidal margins of many cities is increasingly under pressure due to climatic shifts and urbanisation. As rising sea levels push the high-water mark landward, many coastal species are prevented from migrating inland due to natural or man-made barriers. This results in a phenomena known as ‘coastal squeeze’. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pauatahanui Inlet, Porirua supports a diverse ecosystem of aqua-fauna, micro invertebrates and wading birds that rely on the shallow saltmarsh habitat within the estuary. However, with sedimentation from the surrounding catchments slowly filling up the inlet along with and predicted tidal inundation from sea level rise, the future of this coastline is uncertain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than attempting to solve or secure a fixed future for the coastline, as is the prevailing anthropocentric response, this design led research seeks to respond to these human induced pressures by working with the cyclical phenological processes and ecological interactions occurring within the harbour. The research ambition is to co-create a shared public tidal realm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This objective is tested through the design of a coastal boardwalk for the Pauatahanui Inlet. Unlike human-focused boardwalks, this infrastructure is designed with the capacity to adapt as the tidal edge shifts, in either direction, while facilitating movement for all forms of life to traverse the harbour. The research attempts to surpass perceived barriers between nature and culture with an emergent inquiry into the poetic nature of the site itself. Here landscape design practice is developed towards the creation of social capital as occurring between species, while ensuring the natural ecosystem (and the life it supports) has the capacity to adapt to potential climate related changes.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>

AB  - The coastal wetland, a key transitional zone between land and ocean, is a complex and sensitive ecosystem with special environmental processes and functional values. Sediment and sea water samples were taken from Chongming east intertidal flat, a typical coastal wetland in China. Sediment cores were incubated under simulated spring tides (approximately twice a month) and semi-diurnal tides (two almost equal high tides and two low tides in a lunar day), to define the responses of nitrogen to periodic alternation of drying and re-flooding. The contents of NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N, dissolved organic N (DON), and the activities of nitrate reductase (Nar), nitrite reductase (Nir), and hydroxylamine reductase (Hyr) in sediments were determined during the incubation. Nitrification stood in a dominant position during the drying period with sediment moisture decreasing from 35% to 5% -7% in simulated spring tides. The NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N were found to be substantially converted into DON following a further exsiccation (the sediment moisture decreased from 5%-7% to 0%-3%). However, the conversion rates decreased with the increase of drying and rewetting cycles. Following the rewetting of dried sediments (from 0% -3% to 37% -45%), the contents of NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N and DON increased to 1 to 3 times that of the dry sediments. Nar and Nir activities in sediments rapidly increased after the rewetting, indicating that the reduction of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N were substantially enhanced. Significant positive correlations were found between Nar and Nir activities, and Hyr activities and NH4(+) -N contents during the simulated spring tides. Moreover, the decreases of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N contents were observed to be significantly correlated to the increases of NH4(+) -N contents. Combined with the fact that the sediment had a high organic carbon content but a very low NO3(-) -N content, it can be concluded that the reduction of NO3(-) -N and NO2(-) -N following the rewetting was dominated by nitrate ammonification. In contrast, NO3(-) -N, NO2(-) -N, NH4(+) -N and DON contents in sediments were relatively stable during semi-diurnal tides, which were (3.0 +/- 0.3), (1.2 +/- 0.1), (133.3 +/- 4.3) and (41.1 +/- 10.6) mg x kg(-1), respectively. This indicated that semi-diurnal tides slightly affected the variations of nitrogen contents in the wetlands.

AB  - In this study, we estimated hazardous area vulnerable to storm surge and also investigated the areal increases under sea level rise condition. For quantitative assessment together with geospatial analysis with GIS we used precise one-meter-gridded airborne LiDAR-based topographical models, the relative vertical accuracies of which fall within ca. 30 cm excluding outliers. According to the inundation prediction the storm surge hazardous area is predicted to range approximately from 6 to 20 km2 depending on the storm power. The result shows also that in the higher sea level condition in 2100 the areal extent could be increased by up to 68 %. Being noteworthy the areal increase was greater in the small-scale storms than in the large. The elevation models and cross-sectional profiles of the barrier islands protecting the Nakdong estuary were acquired for further assessment and discussion on their roles of natural underwater dykes. As larger inundation potential could be transferred into greater socioeconomic damages, the authors expect that precise quantitative estimation of vulnerability could be used for efficient and rational information for long-term coastal management planning. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - As reported in several studies, even though properly designed, it is possible that groin systems not only cause down-drift beaches to Erode, but also contribute to the generation of rip currents. These rip currents run along the updrift side of the structure, moving sediment offshore where it may be, at least in part, lost from the system. It is well known that the directionality of the incident waves is a central factor for the shoreline response to groins. Until now, however, this directionality has been characterized only by the ratio of net transport rate Qn to gross transport rate Qg. In this study it is concluded that the phase 1 ag b etween the forcing and the morphodynamic response is another key factor responsible for these offshore losses. Based upon this, a relaxation time for open-coast systems and a non-dimensional morphodynamic response factor for groin compartments are introduced as new design parameters for groin systems. These parameters provide an indication about the time it takes for the morphodynamic system to adjust to a change in the hydrodynamic forcing conditions.

AB  - The use of offshore breakwaters for shoreline erosion control and/or recreational beach fill retention is ever increasing in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay. Breakwaters and breakwater systems can be designed utilizing an analysis of the shore morphology and geomorphic evolution of a particular estuarine shore reach. This will reflect the long term wave climate acting on that reach and in particular the net direction of wave approach. The net direction of wave approach is used to establish the dimensions of the two breakwater systems discussed in this paper. These dimensions include breakwater length, gap, and distance offshore. The addition of select beach fill is usually required to provide enhanced recreation and shoreline protection benefits. (A)

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s the biology and geology of the Grand Récif of Tuléar, (now Toliara) in southwestern Madagascar, was thoroughly studied and reported. Toliara is the largest city in the south of the country, and the Grand Récif offshore provides both artisanal fisheries and coastal protection to the growing regional capital. Substantial research on the comparatively pristine reef was described in a volume of Atoll Research Bulletin in 1978. Since then, published scientific study of this reef has been largely lacking. The present study compares the condition of the Grand Récif of circa 40 years ago, with that seen in a brief resurvey undertaken in 2008, on transects corresponding to some of those documented previously. The trend has been of severe degradation; hard coral cover on the fore-reef slopes has declined substantially, and there has been a near total loss of the "architectural species" in particular. Coral has been replaced to great extent by fleshy algae. Observations also indicate severe decline on the broad reef flat, back reef and lagoon areas. Perhaps most seriously for the local fisheries and human communities, is that the fore reef is almost depleted in reef fish today. Comparisons are made of coral cover, coral morphological types and fish trophic structure with other reefs in southern Madagascar, which are not located near large human populations. Although a rise in mean sea surface temperature has occurred throughout the region of approximately 1°C over this 40 year period, which is probably a contributing cause of decline throughout, the Grand Récif is in much worse condition than most of the more remote reefs with which it is compared. It is suggested that the main reasons for the substantial decline in the Grand Récif over the past 40 years lies in the fact that the region's population has grown substantially, there is a complete lack of any resources management, heavy overfishing, and no pollution control, resulting in massively increased discharges of sewage, sediments and other pollutants. Reef condition today is unrecognisable from that described in the 1970s. Unless far-reaching and effective management interventions are adopted to safeguard the Grand Récif the remaining ecosystem services upon which Toliara and its population depend will soon all but disappear.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are estuarine basins where freshwater inflows are trapped behind coastal dune systems, sand spits, or barrier islands which impede exchange with the ocean. They are most frequent in regions where freshwater inflows to the coast are small or seasonal, so that exchange with the ocean may not occur for months or years at a time. Many occupy shallow drowned valleys formed when the sea level was lower during the last ice age and subsequently flooded by postglacial sea level rise. The tidal range is usually small. Accordingly, coastal lagoons are frequently found in warm temperate, dry subtropical, or Mediterranean regions along moderately sheltered coasts. Lagoons are infrequent in wetter temperate and tropical regions where freshwater inflows are sufficient to scour out river mouths and keep them open. Here estuaries are dominated by salt marshes in temperate and mangroves in tropical climes. A particularly good example is the series of coastal habitats on the southern and eastern coastline of Australia which change from open temperate estuaries and salt marshes in the wetter southern regions of Tasmania, through a series of coastal lagoons of varying sizes and ecologies along the south and east coasts, to open subtropical and tropical estuaries, reefs, and mangroves in the warmer and wetter north. A similar, although inverted, sequence can be seen running south along the east coasts of Canada, and the northeastern, central, and southeastern coasts of the USA. The resulting lagoons have varying water residence times, depending on volume, climate, freshwater inflow volumes, and the tidal prism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper documents a novel procedure for assessing the vulnerability of an open-coast dune system to tsunami hazard. Geographic Information System (GIS)–based analyses of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are employed to classify a range of dune topographies in terms of four tsunami inundation scenarios, run-up to 3, 6, 8, and 10 m above mean sea level, along the coast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Analysis reveals two key characteristics which together define the tsunami vulnerability of a narrow vegetated dune system: (i) the elevation or average height of the dune ridge and (ii) the continuity or standard deviation of height of its longshore profile. We find that the Christchurch dune coast currently offers a high degree of protection against inundation from small to medium tsunami (run-up ≤6 m above mean sea level), with the degree of vulnerability under more extreme scenarios varying longshore in relation to the height and continuity of the dune system and its vegetation.

AB  - Planktonic foraminifera and radiolaria have been analysed in a Late Quaternary (40-0ka) sediment sequence from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 658C located under a coastal upwelling system near Cap Blanc, offshore northwest Africa, in order to document the palaeoceanographic history of the area. Temporal variations in species abundance and faunal assemblage analysis reveal a tripartite phased sequence of palaeoceanographic change through the Late Quaternary. Phase 1 spans 40-14.5ka and is characterised by moderate upwelling, but Heinrich event 2 is distinguished as a brief episode of strengthened upwelling. Phase 2 begins with a change in a number of variables at ca. 14.5ka and extends to ca. 5.5ka. This phase is characterised by a general strengthening of upwelling, but may be subdivided into three minor phases including (a) the recognition of the Younger Dryas, marked by a temporary reduction in upwelling strength, followed by (b) an intensification of upwelling, and (c) upwelling and high productivity between 8 and 5.5ka. This phase of upwelling corresponds with maximum Holocene cooling, possibly triggered by the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet. Phase 3 extends from 5.5 to 0ka and is characterised by weak upwelling and significant calcite dissolution. These phases are related to climatic events, particularly the African Humid Period (AHP), which is coincident with Phase 2. The AHP is characterised by increased precipitation, linked to an intensification of the African monsoon that enhances North East Trade Wind-driven coastal upwelling and is associated with the expansion of continental vegetation across North Africa.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey Conference Start Date: 2016, Sept. 19 Conference End Date: 2016, Sept. 23 Conference Location: Monterey, CA, USA The effects of climate change on the near shore coastal environment including ocean acidification, accelerated erosion, destruction of coral reefs, and damage to marine habitat have highlighted the need for improved equipment to study, monitor, and evaluate these changes [1]. This is especially true where areas of study are remote, large, or beyond depths easily accessible to divers. To this end, we have developed three examples of low cost and easily deployable real-time ocean observation platforms. We followed a scalable design approach adding complexity and capability as familiarity and experience were gained with system components saving both time and money by reducing design mistakes. The purpose of this paper is to provide information for the researcher, technician, or engineer who finds themselves in need of creating or acquiring similar platforms.

AB  - From its inception as an object of study, salt marshes were conceived as a form of continual accumulation. For more than a century this paradigm structured the understanding of tidal marshes in Canada's St. Lawrence estuary and was used by physical and human geographers, biologists, agronomists, and ecologists to encourage marsh reclamation as a form of collaboration with nature. In the 1980s, this school of thought abruptly gave way to a school of generalized erosion. This new paradigm, resulting from the scientific and social reaction to the Anthropocene and the advent of applied research in risk management, underlies a crisis narrative used to promote intervention by concerned actors to protect marshes and human infrastructure. Although the changing socioeconomy of salt marshes is well known, the evolution of scientific thinking about them continues to be depicted in positivist terms. Critical reflection on salt marshes as a social construction of nature, however, demonstrates a clear chain of links between cultural values, scientific practices, and research outcomes. Lack of recognition of this subject-object problem impedes the current investigation of salt marsh dynamics as a function of both erosion and growth processes.

AB  - The inner 1/3 of the Isahaya Bay which is a tributary of Ariake Sea in Japan was shut off from the sea by a dike for the reclamation and disaster prevention in 1997. On the other hand, several environmental and fisheries problems occurred in Ariake Sea after 1990s. Some fishermen insisted that the major reason for the decrease of fishing must be the influence of the dike construction and filed lawsuits. Now the court decision is fixed and Japanese government must open the gates until December 2013. We made numerical simulations of currents, hydrography and sediment transport to assess the influences of the gate opening. To choose the environmentally wise procedure of gate opening, it is needed to reduce the erosion and deposition of bottom sediments caused by the enhanced tidal current and to minimize the occurrence of hypoxia in the reservoir.

AB  - <jats:p>To gain a better understanding of the cycles of shoreline changes on Seabrook Island, South Carolina and advise a private developer on how to deal with localized erosion problems, a detailed field survey and historical study were completed. The data base included historical charts dating from 1661, vertical aerial photographs from 1939, field surveys of beach profiles and nearshore bathymetry over a sixmonth period, and sediment cores through the entire Holocene section. Seabrook Island, less than 6 km in length, is bounded by tidal inlets with extensive seaward shoals. With a 2 m tidal range for the area, changing exposure and orientation of the shoals over time has had a profound effect on the adjacent shoreline of Seabrook Island. Historical evidence points to the importance of offshore shoals which act as natural breakwaters and sediment storage systems. At various times in recent history, these shoals have supplied sediment to Seabrook beaches by means of bypassing mechanisms around tidal inlets. On the other hand, migration of shoals has allowed excess wave energy to strike portions of the shore causing local erosion. Along a portion of the shoreline, short-term erosion is jeopardizing the development. Based on the present study, a set of "soft" engineering designs was proposed which attempt to manipulate offshore sand bodies in a way that will be beneficial to the development and preserve the inherent beauty of the shoreline. Remedial measures recommended for the developer included dredging new inlet channels and construction of a breakwater in the position of a former protective shoal.</jats:p>

AB  -. Much of the low-lying farmland around the coastline of south-east England was once inter-tidal salt marsh, which was subsequently reclaimed from the sea and converted to farmland. It is becoming increasingly uneconomic to maintain the embankments which protect this land from the sea. ‘Managed retreat’ involves relocating the embankments further inland and recreating inter-tidal habitat in front of them. Salt marsh not only provides a protective buffer for these sea walls by dissipating wave energy, but is also important as a habitat for birds and as a source of organic matter for fish and inter-tidal fauna. When ‘managed retreat’ takes place, the creation of inter-tidal habitat occurs on soils that have undergone physical and chemical changes, some of which are irreversible. However, the indications are that rapid sedimentation creates conditions in which salt marsh plants germinate and become established; soil salinity rises quickly to a level which restricts competition from terrestrial plants, and deposited sediment is relatively rich in available phosphorus. The physical properties of the old agricultural soil influence the subsequent development of creeks.

AB  - Waterfront infrastructure represents a significant investment and owners have a vested interest in maintaining and extending the service life of these aging assets. Exposed to the harsh marine environment, these assets are subject to degradation more than most non-marine assets. In addition, most owners are interested in protecting life safety and the environment through proactive and cost-effective maintenance. Recognizing these drivers, the ASCE/COPRI Ports & Harbors Committee's Waterfront Inspection Task Committee has developed a new manual to guide the inspection of waterfront assets. The new manual, "Waterfront Facilities Inspection and Assessment Standard Practice Manual," provides comprehensive guidance for the inspection and maintenance of waterfront structures both above water and underwater, as well as associated mooring hardware, fender systems, utilities, and appurtenant features. Eight inspection types are defined in the manual, with each inspection performed for a specific purpose using a tailored scope of work. Inspection types may also be combined and performed simultaneously. The eight inspection types include: Routine Inspection Structural Repair or Upgrade Inspection New Construction Inspection Baseline Inspection Due Diligence Inspection Special Inspection Repair Construction Inspection Post-Event Inspection The manual provides guidance on modeling service life using software such as STADIUM® to provide quantitative solutions to extending the life of waterfront structures. The manual covers every type of waterfront structure type commonly in use. Specific guidance is provided on the nuances of each structure type and the defects commonly found. The structure types covered include: piers (jetties), wharves (quays), bulkheads (quaywalls), seawalls, relieving platforms, gravity block walls, caissons and cofferdams, wave screens/attenuators, marinas, boat ramps, marine railways, floating structures, mooring buoys (SPMs, MBMs, etc.), and slope/shoreline protection. The intent of the manual is to provide owners and specifiers with guidance on what type of inspection to choose for a particular facility need, making the process simpler and more uniform since the scope of each inspection type is defined. The result is a standardized process that will assist owners in maintaining their waterfront assets and extending the service life proactively. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The city of Mangalore is situated at the confluence of rivers Gurpur and Netravati, India. Two spits are formed in this area, i.e., northern spit of "Bengre" and the southern spit of "Ullal" as the rivers flow close and parallel to the seashore for some distance. The spits have been subjected to constant geomorphological changes in length, width, position, accretion and erosion patterns etc., for the past several decades. A seawall was constructed in 1984 around the tip of Bengre spit and another one along the shoreline of Ullal spit in 1987, by the Government of Karnataka in order to prevent the spits from being eroded. Two breakwaters were also constructed in 1992 near the estuarine mouth as part of the development of old Mangalore Port. The paper presents the results of a study undertaken to identify the geomorphologic changes that occurred in the area, using IRS-1A/1C data for the years of 1988, 1994, 1996. The study clearly demonstrated that the IRS data could be effectively utilized for monitoring the geodynamics of an area. It was observed that the spits were highly unstable earlier. However, the construction of seawalls was helpful in arresting the migration of the estuarine mouth and in stabilizing the spits against coastal erosion.

AB  - Freshwater marshes cover 4000 square kilometers of the Louisiana coastal zone and are the most abundant marsh habitat type. Many of these marshes actually float as organic mats on underlying water. Some estimates suggest as much as 70% of Louisiana's coastal freshwater marsh are of the floating variety. The slow flow of water characteristic of these environments generally transports very little sediment. As a result, the marsh substrate is composed of primarily live and dead organic matter (peat formation) rather than mineral sediments. Since floating marshes are structurally different than intertidal marsh habitats, many traditional oil spill response options are ineffective or inappropriate. Access to the marsh is often limited since there is no open water ingress and the marsh structure cannot support the weight of equipment. Oil spill response options are further complicated when the source of the oil is a pipeline leak located below the floating marsh mat; spilled oil is free to travel at the interface of the underlying water and mat. Protection booming is impossible. Oil impacts often result in the death of all the living plants that are integral to the formation and sustainability of the habitat. This paper reports on two oil spills in a floating marsh near Paradis, Louisiana that occurred eight years apart. Both spills were spatially close to each other, which provided an excellent comparison for assessing potential long-term impact from oil spills in floating marshes. During both oil spill responses, unique response techniques were developed to recover spilled oil and enhance marsh recovery. An effective technique was to rake away and remove the dead oil-contaminated surface plant debris from the site and employ sorbent recovery. Lessons learned from these responses were used to develop mitigation guidance for future responses.

AB  - It is generally considered that nitrogen availability is one of the major factors regulating primary production in temperate coastal marine environments. Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea-grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria.

AB  - In order to achieve compliance with their Consumptive Use Permit for groundwater withdrawals, Tampa Bay Water, a regional water supply authority on the west coast of Florida, needed to implement a new surface water supply by December 31, 2002 in order to reduce pumping from their stressed well fields. This was accomplished by a fast-track design and construction program that built two new surface water intakes and pump stations that connected to a new treatment plant via 14-miles of 72 and 84-inch transmission mains. The alignment of the new pipelines required the acquisition of over 120 separate easements. Because the land acquisition was ongoing during the design phase, access was not available to certain properties for collecting geotechnical data prior to bidding and awarding the construction contract. Only after the Contractor was mobilized and under construction was it determined that one of the designated wetlands that needed to be crossed consisted of muck and peat extending to depths ranging from 50 to 70 feet below land surface. It immediately became apparent that it would be cost prohibitive to remove and replace the unsuitable material with backfill capable of supporting the 72-inch steel pipe. Installing the pipe in the native material was the only available option. Because of the unsuitable nature of the soil, settlement of the full pipe during dry periods and flotation of the empty pipe during wet conditions were factors that had to be quickly evaluated and addressed without delaying the Contractor. Working with the pipe manufacturer, American Spiralweld Pipe, the design engineers, Camp Dresser & McKee Inc., considered alternative pipe support methods and developed a pipe hanger system that utilized helical anchors similar to those used in underpinning structures. Structural cross beams and cradles were designed to handle the dead load and buoyant forces that could develop over the design life of the pipeline. To maximize the use of pipe material already fabricated, The Pipe Manufacturer reorganized the laying schedule and factory cut the 45-foot pieces into two 22.5-foot pieces that could be installed by the smaller equipment that had to be used due to the soil bearing limitations of the dewatered wetland. The Pipe Manufacturer also designed and manufactured wrapper plates and stiffener rings that could be field installed to allow the existing pipe to perform within the specified ring deflection as if it were installed in an aerial crossing. Without the close coordination and teamwork exhibited by the Design Engineer and the Pipe Manufacturer, the project would have experienced significant delays and subsequent fines associated with violating the permit conditions. This paper will outline the steps taken by both parties to expedite submittal preparation, reviews and approvals necessary to maintain the critical schedule for completion.

AB  - In the Ems-Dollard estuary at the southern North Sea coast a revaluation of design water levels along the German dykes has become necessary, since the safety margin for sea level rise was increased by 25 cm due to a decision of the Lower Saxon Ministry for Environment and Climate Protection. The upstream part of the estuary is protected against high storm surges by a storm surge barrier. The closure of the barrier effects downstream surge water levels due to partial reflection. Deterministic-mathematical modeling is applied to evaluate design water levels and design wave run-up. Three severe storm surge events have been hindcasted by a cascade of three hierarchical models from the Continental Shelf over the German Bight into the area of interest. The models are forced by non-stationary and spatially varying data of atmospheric pressure, wind velocities and directions available of meteorological model investigations. The verification of the storm surge model with water level observations yields good agreements. With respect to legal boundary conditions, the single-value-method is applied to determine the highest expected high water level at Emden. Starting from this target water level, the wind velocities in the meteorological boundary conditions are increased with the aim to increase the surge level at the coast and to match the predetermined design water level at Emden. The responding water levels in the Ems-Dollard estuary assign the new design water levels.

AB  - Plant communities are vital to maintaining diverse coastal and estuarine ecosystems in Louisiana's Deltaic and Chenier Plains. These plant assemblages provide not only primary productivity but also structural stability to terrestrial (supratidal) and aquatic (inter- and subtidal) substrates, thereby creating diverse habitats for many important estuarine and coastal fauna. Barrier islands are an important and dynamic component of the coastal landscape with plant assemblages ranging from terrestrial dune habitats to swales and intertidal back-barrier marshes. Barrier islands provide protection for bayward submersed aquatic vegetation and interior salt marsh plant assemblages by reducing wave energy and allowing shallow water habitats to exist over large expanses. Further landward, vast expanses of brackish, intermediate, and fresh marsh habitat make up Louisiana's extensive coastal marsh ecosystems. Louisiana's barrier islands have migrated landward and decreased in size through time as overwash events have become more frequent in this sand-deficient system. In the absence of restoration efforts to bring sand resources back into the system, island degradation will result in significant reductions in habitat diversity and loss of protection of mainland resources. This article provides an overview of Louisiana's coastal plant communities, emphasizing the key role of barrier island plant communities in the deltaic landscape. The companion article focuses on the animal resources of the Louisiana Gulf shoreline.

AB  - The Island of Sylt was formed by the deposits of ice ages and the succeeding sea level rises. The history of the coastal defences began for about 150 years. But the cross-shore and alongshore measures like groynes, walls and revetments couldn't achieve sustained effect against the long-term retreat. With the beginning of sand nourishments in the year 1972, respectively 1984, it was possible to stop the further erosion of cliffs and dunes. The annual loss of sand along the west coast is estimated to approximately I million cubic meters. Beside the natural retreat of the beaches also the offshore suffers a negative volume development, especially towards the northern and southern spits. The island grows northwards and south-eastwards. During storm surges the sand is relocated towards the sea and afterwards the beaches are recovered by some extend. Thus, the total loss is only due to the residual alongshore transport. The costs of nourishments could be lowered since the measures were tendered for longer periods. Another way to reduce the costs is to put in the nourished sand in front of the beach.

AB  - To design a coastal structure constructed on a fringing reef, it is important to estimate not only wave height reduction but also wave set-up and surf-beat distribution, because they can cause sea-level rise in front of the coastal structure, and increase wave force and wave overtopping rate on it. In this study, a series of numerical experiments is conducted by using a Boussinesq wave model to especially reveal the characteristics of surf-beat distribution, after the wave breaking model based on a one-equation turbulence model is modified through the verification with experimental results. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - A collection of fluoride concentration data for air, water, soil, vegetation and marine samples in the vicinity of a large, aluminum smelter operating at the head of Kitimat Arm, a typical Canadian west coast fjord with high rainfall, is surveyed. The significance of the fluoride distribution and dispersion processes derived from this data matrix and from special leaching tests using water, dilute acids, and aqueous sodium bicarbonate is considered in the light of prevailing temperature, wind and precipitation patterns with regard to the plant, animal, and marine life of the area. The most recent data available are further related to the time of complete installation of dry scrubber emission control devices to determine how ambient air, water, soil, and vegetation concentrations may be responding to the reduced air and water mass emissions rates.

AB  - In Schleswig-Holstein works to stabilise existing saltmarshes as well as to enhance saltmarsh acceretion for agricultural and coastal defence purposes began more than one century ago. Today the agricultural role of saltmarshes is insignificant. The ecological importance on the other hand has gained increasing attention. This change in attitude mirrors in the Schleswig-Holstein State Environmental Act of 1993. According to this Act saltmarshes have a very high ecological value. Hence, they are protected and natural processes must prevail. In order to realise these regulations a saltmarsh managementplan was established in co-operation between coastal defence and environmental authorities. This plan contains a common principle for future management, a number of regional managementplans as maps, an examination of techniques used and a monitoring progamme. Common principle is to preserve existing saltmarshes. Where no saltmarshes exist in front of dikes they must be created. The techniques used to reach this goal depend upon local circumstances und must be carried out as ecologically sound as possible.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change constitutes a main challenge for the Wadden Sea. Accelerated sea level rise, increasing temperatures and changing wind climate may strongly alter present structures and functions of the ecosystem with negative consequences both for nature conservation and for coastal risk management. Being aware of these challenges, Schleswig-Holstein State Government decided to establish an integrated climate change adaptation strategy for the Schleswig-Holstein sector of the Wadden Sea. The strategy was adopted in June 2015. It aims at the long-term maintenance of present functions and structures as well as the integrity of the Wadden Sea ecosystem in a changing climate. The strategy was prepared by a project group consisting of representatives from State authorities as well as from nature conservation organisations and local institutions. First outcome of the strategy is that extra adaptation measures will not be necessary in the coming decades. However, pending on the future rate of sea level rise, shoreline erosion and sediment deficits in the Wadden Sea will increase and sooner or later drowning of tidal flats and terrestrial habitats like beaches, primary dunes and salt marshes will start. At the time when management measures to counteract the negative developments become expedient from a nature conservation viewpoint as well as for coastal risk management, adequate actions with minimized ecological interferences are possible. It is assumed that balancing the sediment deficits as the main adaptation measure may be implemented most efficiently by concentrating sediment suppletion at locations where natural forces organize redistribution in the Wadden Sea. Local technical coastal risk management measures like the strengthening of sea defences will, nevertheless, remain necessary as well.

AB  - The Yellow River delta is one of the most active regions in the world,where wetlands play a significant role in balancing the regional eco-environment. However,in past decades,it has been subjected to severe disturbance by nature and by humans. Thus,it is critical to figure out what changes have occurred during this period and what could be done in this region now to protect the local wetland system. Therefore,in this study,we took Landsat satellite imagery from 9 years( 1973,1979,1985,1992,1995,2000,2005,2010,and 2013) as data sources to build wetland thematic databasesusing the method of visual interpretation. Based on these databases,a Surface Wetland and Construction State Index( SWCSI) was constructed to indicate the state of the land cover. These were combined with Yellow River runoff and sediment data,regional precipitation,local GDP,aquatic product output,and crude salt output. Then,the driving forces and corresponding spatial heterogeneity of wetland variations in the past 40 years in regions of the Yellow River delta were quantitatively analyzed at regional and pixel scales. From this research,we concluded that the area of wetland in the Yellow River Delta declined during the years 1973-2013,accompanied by large-scale conversion of natural wetlands to artificial wetlands and non-wetland. In the past 40 years,the area of natural wetlands decreased by 42. 67%( annual reduction of30.58 km2). In contrast,the area of artificial wetlands increased by 490.52%( annual increase of 24.47 km2). As a result,the total wetland area was reduced by 7.99%( annual reduction of 6.13 km2). The variations of wetland in the Yellow River delta showed high spatial heterogeneities. Wetlands in coastal regions experienced artificial enhancement or wetland degradation,while those in estuarine regions experienced wetland construction and development; however,there were no changes in the western and southwestern traditional farming districts. On the regional scale,GDP was the dominant driving force for wetland variation in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 40 years,intensifying human activities and decreasing Yellow River runoff and sediment made a number of important changes( decreases in natural wetlands,increase in artificial wetlands,and degradation of regional wetlands) more serious. In contrast,a large area of natural wetland was constructed and developed in the estuary of the Yellow River because of the continuous runoff and sediment supply,although there has been an overall decline in these factors during the past 40 years. Therefore,the Yellow River runoff and sediment still played an important role in the evolution of wetlands in the Yellow River Delta,but this role was not very significant because these influences were regionally limited. The influence of regional precipitation on wetland evolution was extremely limited. This was perhaps due to the severe dependence of the regional wetlands on runoff. At the pixel scale,the driving factors of evolution of the Yellow River delta wetlands showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. This was mainly due to the spatial heterogeneity of driving force factors themselves.

AB  - This thesis aims to address some of the gaps in knowledge in life stage specific habitat use and mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) by bringing together five separate studies. Electrofishing techniques are widely used for the estimation of the size of stream dwelling fish populations for both fishery management and scientific study. In contrast to multiple pass, population depletion methods, single pass catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) methods are less time consuming and labour intensive. A possible issue with the commonly used, fixed total time CPUE protocol is that it does not differentiate between the time spent actively fishing and the time incurred while not actively fishing, leading to handling error which is likely related to fish density. This was tested in a comparative field study. It showed that this commonly used technique is systematically underestimating juvenile salmonid numbers at higher densities. In addition this technique is failing to adequately determine fish community structure at low population densities. This work indicates a simple modification to the methodology that will reduce systematic error. Knowledge of the species' biology and habitat requirements can be linked with habitat data to create a model that predicts the distribution of that species. As salmonids, such as Atlantic salmon, have fairly strict habitat requirements, knowledge of habitat use by salmon can then be used to estimate the potential salmonid production in a given area of certain quality. The accuracy of a habitat grading system currently used by the Loughs Agency was tested. The results suggest that in its current format, the habitat grading system does not accurately describe the abundance of juvenile salmonids. When data was analysed to see which habitat variables best described salmonid density, for 0+ salmon important variables were flow and substrate and for older juveniles the important variables were flow, substrate, depth and percentage of undercut banks. All populations are controlled by density-dependent and density-independent factors. For a species such as Atlantic salmon that has life stages differing in habitat requirements, the relative contributions of these two factors for population regulation on each life stage are likely to vary. Using a long-term data-set on Atlantic salmon migrants returning to the Foyle catchment, Ireland, the role of density-dependent and life-stage specific environmental factors regulating population size was determined. A Ricker density-dependent model showed that the spawning adult population size significantly predicted variation in the resultant filial generation, however a large amount of variation remained unexplained. It was shown that environmental factors were significant in explaining some of the remaining variance and that these influences were linked to specific life stages. Three life stages - spawning and incubation, fry emergence, and marine survival - were shown to be sensitive to environmental effects resulting in changes to the returning cohort strength. It is concluded that these life stage specific environmental effects are likely to contribute to the stochastic variation in population size resulting from the application of traditional stock-recruitment models. Atlantic salmon undertake extensive migrations between freshwater and marine habitats. Smolt migration is associated with high mortality and is thus considered a critical life stage in the Atlantic salmon life history. Smolt migration through standing waters is still mostly an unknown process. Using acoustic telemetry, three hypotheses derived from known principles of migration in rivers were tested: i.) smolts will take the shortest possible route, ii.) smolts will display unidirectional movement and iii.) smolts will be continuously moving. None of these three expectations were supported by the results of this study. Instead evidence was found of smolts moving in a seemingly random fashion, displaying counter intuitive migration patterns and spending relative y l ng periods effectively static during their lake migration. Brown trout display a great range of life history variation ranging from river residency to anadromy. Unlike Atlantic salmon that migrate hundreds of kilometres to the open ocean to feed, anadromous brown trout often stay within 80-100 km from their natal river in coastal areas. Despite this, very little is still known about their behaviour during this coastal feeding part of the life cycle. It was found that brown trout in the Clyde estuary use a fairly small part of the estuary and seem to move fairly actively. Fish size did not explain any of the movement or residency patterns. The results of the five separate studies presented in this thesis provide tools for managers of anadromous salmonids.

AB  - <jats:p>Due to their dynamic mode of operation, waste treatment pond and activated sludge plant effluents always contain quite large amounts of nitrogen relative to those found in natural lakes, streams, and oceans. Typical activated sludge plant effluents contain 25 mgl-1 N, mostly as ammonia. In most aquatic milieux, concentrations of ammonia &amp;gt; 1 mgl-1 N are potentially toxic to fish and other wildlife. Nitrification and denitrification of activated sludge plant effluent alleviates the ammonia problem at a considerable cost but the discharges still usually contain over 10 mgl-1 NO3-N which exceeds the WHO standard for drinking water. A great advantage of waste treatment pond effluents is that nitrogen is normally already present as nitrate or particulate-N (algae and bacteria), and nitrate concentrations are &amp;lt; 5 mgl-1 NO3-N. However, even 1 mgl-1 of nitrate-N is sufficient to cause eutrophication in unpolluted lakes, streams, and oceans and some of the particulate-N discharged will be recycled to give eutrophication downstream. Where sufficient diluting water is available, these higher effluent concentrations are not a problem. Unfortunately, clean diluting water is becoming a scarce commodity in many areas, particularly the 17 semi-arid states in the USA and in most developing countries where rainfall is needed for drinking water and wildlife support. One solution for nitrogen removal is new design for free surface constructed wetlands which have considerable potential for nitrogen polishing of waste treatment pond effluents. Particulate-N can be removed by using wetlands as large filters but the nitrogen often recycles and is released as ammonia in winter and spring. Denitrification of nitrate to N2 gas removes the problem permanently. In particular, the relatively low BOD, high nitrate and low ammonia effluent from some stabilization ponds is ideal for nitrate removal (denitrification) by free surface wetlands. Rates of nitrate removal of 200 to over 5,000 mg N m-2 d-1 can be achieved with initial nitrate values of 2-14 mgl-1 NO3-N. These rates are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than occur in most natural lake, estuarine or wetlands sediments and can be mostly attributed to denitrification rather than growth of rooted plants. In two weeks 20 mgl-1 NO3-N can be reduced to less than 1 mgl-1. After wetlands treatment the water is suitable for release into water-depleted live streams or lakes where a low eutrophication potential is vital for native biota. It is recommended that pond effluent be routed thorough constructed wetlands whenever possible since both better water quality and wildlife benefits occur.</jats:p>

AB  - Coastal areas are economically vital in terms of population, industry, trade and tourism. The numbers of people and properties at risk will increase as economies grow or develop, while climate change will amplify the likelihood of extreme events, as well as accelerate potential habitat decline. The development of a systematic approach to deliver both a low-risk coast for human use and healthy habitats subject to multiple change factors is envisaged within the European project THESEUS of which this study forms a part. Plymouth Sound to Exe Estuary UK is one of several project sites. This site involves complex coastal and estuarine processes; interactions between coastal defence structures, coastal morphology and ecological habitats; and significant economic, social and environmental impacts, which makes a really interesting and challenging site to study. It is concluded that should the extreme changes for the four main sources (mean sea-level, waves surge and river flow) coincide, the impact would be catastrophic if land usage remains as it is today.

AB  - There has been considerable research into the science of global climate change, however, there is presently little guidance for coastal authorities on accounting for the physical impacts of ongoing climate change in future land use planning and coastal defence policy. For the central south coast of England, this paper briefly identifies 'coastal climate change scenarios' for the next 80 years. A qualitative geomorphological appraisal of the potential impacts of these changes on coastal landforms and processes is presented, based upon generic 'coastal behaviour systems' that take account of the various sensitivities to change of the natural and managed coastline. Functions such as the sensitivity of coastal slopes to increasing effective rainfall, and barrier beaches to increased water levels, are considered. The likely future 'behaviour' of these systems, and in particular the potential for climate-induced changes, are identified. The likely response of the coastal systems then provides an objective framework for evaluating hazard and risk. The levels of risk are strongly linked to the historic pattern of land use and development, which in many cases will not accommodate natural adjustment of coastal features. Without effective management, hazards will increase and coastal communities will be vulnerable and at risk under future climate change. Recommendations are made regarding improving the risk management framework in the face of climate change impacts. Recommendations include issues such as compensation, the planning framework, coastal defence provision, nature conservation, data collection and education. Although the results are specific to the study area, the methodology developed is transferable, offering a valuable model for other coastal managers.

Multivariate statistical techniques brought out the fact that the Oosterschelde, when compared with neighbouring areas, has a characteristic epibenthic fauna. Diversity as measured by Hill’s diversity numbers N through N + ∞, is higher for the Oosterschelde (N1 = 4.5) than for the Voordelta (N1 = 3.5) and the Westerschelde (N1 = 2.2).

AB  - In view of the features of low temperature and high salt in estuary wetland, two coldtolerance and salt-tolerance strains were separated from the Liaohe estuary wetlands in surface sediments and domesticated HXN-1 and HXN-2, respectively. Two strains are identified as Ochrobactrum sp. and Aquamicrobium sp. In addition, single factor experiments (pH, C/N and petroleum hydrocarbons) were used to study the effect on ammonia oxidation of two ammonia oxidation bacteria. The results showed that the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is significantly inhibited under too high or too low pH, the optimum pH range is 7-9; the efficiency reduced with the increase of C/N, the highest ammonia oxidation efficiency are 88.89% and 90.18% respectively, which is achieved without organic matter. With the increasing concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons, petroleum hydrocarbons enhance the inhibition to ammonia oxidation efficiency.

AB  - The Great Brak is a temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) located on the south coast of South Africa. The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing the mouth to breach less often. The aim of this study was to  investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH4 +, TOxN [NO 3  - + NO 2  -], SRP) as well as total N and P across the  sediment–water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic  pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed that the sediment had a net efflux of NH 4  +, SRP, TN and TP while TOxN was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and winter. If the estuary  remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the benthos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing methods or, more importantly, an increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.

AB  - Most theories on the equilibrium shape of estuarine basins highlight the dominance of tidal asymmetry in controlling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic feedbacks that ultimately lead to a stable morphological state. This thesis uses field measurements, numerical modelling and sediment deposition records to investigate how waves interact with tidal processes and how these interactions influence sediment transport and the non-linear feedbacks between hydrodynamics and estuarine basin morphology. Numerical modelling experiments were conducted over a series of idealised estuaries representing different stages of infilling, which show that wind and waves are far more efficient than tides at shaping intertidal areas, with the effect being subtly dependent on the depth distribution in the intertidal. Moreover, the wind and wave climate can substantially alter the hydrodynamic regime over the entire estuary and in intertidal areas can exert a much greater control on asymmetry than tidal currents alone, which dominate in the deeper channels. Under the effect of tides alone, currents over intertidal flats are to found to remain flood-dominant as the estuary infills, thus promoting continued accretion until tidal currents become too weak to entrain sediment. Therefore, estuaries with only tidal currents are likely to evolve into in-filled areas of salt-marsh or mangrove with drainage channels, whereas fetch-aligned estuaries (in which wind-waves are common) have a greater probability of attaining deeper hydrodynamically-maintained stable intertidal areas. Although waves have little direct influence on hydrodynamics within the subtidal channel, the tidal asymmetry is controlled by the height and volume of the intertidal areas and therefore is indirectly influenced by wave activity. The higher-energy, infrequent storm-wave events can considerably modify estuarine morphology over short timescales whereas lower-energy but perpetual effects like the tides operate continuously and so the relative contribution of such events in shaping the long-term morphological evolution can be considered on a range of timescales. Within this thesis a combination of hydrodynamic measurements, sediment deposition records and numerical modelling are used to determine the conditions under which observed waves are morphologically significant. Morphological significance is defined as when waves influence tidal and suspended sediment flux asymmetry and subsequently infilling over geomorphological timescales. By comparing a fetch-aligned and a non fetch-aligned mesotidal basin, it is shown that for a sufficiently large fetch, even small and frequently occurring wind events are able to create waves that are morphologically significant. Conversely, in basins with a reduced fetch, wave events are less frequent and therefore of far less morphological significance. The role of tidal range in controlling sediment transport is investigated through consideration of its influence on bed shear stress, τmax. The decrease in bed shear stress associated…

AB  - A review is given on the purposes, scope and present state of oceanographic modelling, with reference to existing and potential management applications. Particular attention is paid to predictive numerical models. Forecast models of tides, meteorologically driven surges and waves in shelf seas are perhaps furthest developed, and are particularly relevant to coastal protection, coastal and offshore engineering and navigation. Such models can also be used to improve statistical estimates of extreme and long term conditions for design purposes. Circulation, dispersion and transport modelling is at an earlier stage of development, and validation data is generally harder to obtain. Nevertheless, such modelling has important applications to e.g. fisheries, waste disposal, accidental spillage and dredging. These applications also require the integration of biological, chemical and sediment interactions and transports.

AB  - Since the introduction of the emulsified fuel, ORIMULSION®, to the power generation market in the early nineties, significant work has been undertaken studying the behaviour of, response to, and potential cleanup techniques for a possible spill of this fuel. The studies have in particular been carried out by sponsorships funded by BITOR, the producer of ORIMULSION®, but an important part has also been sponsored by US and Canadian government agencies. One of the most recent contributions is the report, "Spills of Emulsified Fuels, Risks and Response" a project under the US National Research Council (NRC). To date there have been no significant spills of ORIMULSION® to enable full scale use, under real life cleanup conditions, of the various conventional and new techniques and technologies, which have been developed and tested for the purpose. However, several developments and tests over the past decade and especially over the past three years, sponsored by BITOR, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG), and Environment Canada (EC), combined with a sound portion of experience with the response to spills of heavy oil, make it most relevant to present a hands-on review of the available response options. Since ORIMULSION® has a surfactant added in the form of its emulsifying surfactant, a spill at open sea may be considered a spill of a pre-dispersed oil. Consequently, the preferred offshore response methodology would be to monitor the naturally dispersed bitumen plume. Therefore, this paper will mainly cover monitoring and response to near-shore and dockside spills in salt-, brackish-, and fresh water, which might call for a clean-up effort, as well as shoreline protection and clean-up.

AB  - An aerial photographic analysis of the beaches of Oahu was conducted for a period of up to 50 years. The results indicate that the most unstable beaches are on sand bodies projecting from the coastline, such as Kualoa Point, Iroquois Point, and Paiko Peninsula. Beach changes on Oahu can be characterized by the coastline. On the north shore, intermittent erosion occurs when the beach is overwashed by waves of unusual height and force. Aerial photographs records the effects of the December 1-4, 1969 storm, 1946 tsunami and possibly the 1957 tsunami. Beaches facing the northeast trade wind direction are especially dynamic systems. Along much of the south shore, waves break at the seaward edge of a shallow fringing reef. As wave energy is reduced, many of the beaches are relatively stable. On the leeward coast, the south end of Kahe Beach and the ends of Maili Beach have a history of persistent erosion. Most other beaches had no apparent long-term change. Nevertheless, periodic damage to the backshore area may occur from large Kona Storm waves or refracted North Pacific swell.

AB  - The Ebre (Ebro) Delta is one of the most important wetland areas in the western Mediterranean. Ca. 40% of the delta plain is less than 0.5 m above mean sea level and part of the southern margin of the delta is at mean sea level in an area protected by dikes. Both mean rates of secular subsidence in the Ebre Delta and eustatic sea level rise are ca. 1-2 mm/yr. Thus, the present annual relative sea level rise (RSLR) rate in the Ebre Delta may be at least 3 mm/yr. Measured accretion rates in the delta range from 4 mm/yr in the wetlands surrounding the river mouth to <0.1 mm/yr in impounded salt marshes and rice fields. The annual sediment deficit in the delta plain to offset RSLR is close to 1 million m3/yr. Accretion rates in the rice fields prior to the construction of large dams in the Ebre watershed were higher than RSLR rates, from 3-15 mm/yr. At present, > 99% of the riverine sediments are retained in the reservoirs and rice fields are losing ca. 0.2 mm/yr. Future management plans should take RSLR into account and include control of freshwater and sediment flows from the river in order to offset negative effects from waterlogging and salt intrusion, and maintain land elevation. This will include the partial removal of sediments trapped behind the Ribarroja and Mequinença dams. Stocks and inputs of sediments in the corresponding reservoirs are large enough for land elevation of ca. 50 cm in the whole delta plain. Advantages of this solution include (1) new sediments to the delta to offset subsidence (via rice fields) and coastal retreat, (2) enhanced functioning of the delta (productivity and nutrient processing), (3) avoidance of accumulation of sediments in the reservoirs. Hence, it is important to manage river discharges at the dams from an integrated viewpoint, whereas currently only hydropower and agricultural requirements are considered. It is also crucial to maintain periods of high discharge, to have enough river energy to transport as much sediments as possible. © 1997 EUCC.

AB  - A better definition of the long term protection strategies against littoral hazards requires evaluating investment, management, and maintenance costs of various interventions on levees and other civil engineering structures, as well as on beaches and dunes. The cost study of coastal protections (Cerema 2018) aims at providing the assessment of the project global cost. Based on the study of a large number of projects completed in France, estimations were produced to enhance the reliability of these calculations at the scale of a site in the littoral zone or of an individual natural or artificial structure. For each structure type, the obtained results are essentially linear, surface, volume or mass costs (initial costs or annual average costs), as well as lifetime and intervention frequency. To obtain this information, the analysis mainly consisted of: • the creation of a typology which crosses « structure type» and « intervention type» which allows establishing homogeneous groups of characteristic operations; • the identification, for every group, of physical parameters influencing the associated costs, which allows the user of the manual to evaluate better the difference between the observed high and low values. This paper presents the context of the study, its methodological process, the progress of the investigations and the analyses, the obtained results, and finally the generic lessons learned. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - <jats:p>This paper produces an integrated concept between mangrove rehabilitation efforts and educational tourismas an innovative solution for disaster mitigation in Sei Pakning from a landscape architecture perspective. The study location is in Pangkalan Jambi, where a "Mangrove Education Center (MEC) has been established. This study aims to design integrated landscape management by considering three existing interests: ecological protection, biodiversity conservation, and economic utilization. Through the stages of inventory, analysis, synthesis, conceptualization, and tourism planning based on local resources, the three interests in the utilization of mangrove forest areas are believed to be realized. The aspect of ecological protection is carried out by setting management boundaries. Aspects of biodiversity conservation are carried out through species enrichment by mangrove nurseries and environmental education to the public. In economic utilization, technical modifications for planting mangrove zones for saline tilapia cultivation are carried out with a silvofishery pattern. Another integrated aspect is mitigating coastal disasters by making "Hybrid Engineering" or modifying the structure of a simple Wave Breaker (APO). The institutional empowerment aspect is inseparable from the design so that the level of benefit for the community can be achieved. In conclusion, the landscape design of the Pangkalan Jambi mangrove forest can be used to manage the area sustainably because it combines many interests without disturbing each other.Keywords: Coastal, disaster mitigation, Integrated landscape management, Landscape design, Mangrove</jats:p>

AB  - Wetlands play a number of roles in the water environment, principally water purification, flood control, and groundwater replenishment. In addition to these benefits, United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Ramsar Convention defined wetlands to be of biosphere significance and societal importance in the areas of shoreline stabilisation, storm protection, cultural values, recreation and tourism, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. The function of most natural wetland systems is not to treat wastewater, however, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental scientists who specialize in the area of wastewater treatment. In the past wetlands used to be in place naturally and used to provide ecological benefits to the mankind and environment. Through recognizing their immense benefits, human being started to construct artificial wetlands. Recently, constructed wetlands are recommended as one of the salient features of water sensitive urban design, which play an important role in water management and ecologically sustainable development. These constructed artificial wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to help in treating wastewater effluent. Artificial wetlands provide the ability to experiment with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and flora in order to produce the most efficient treatment process. Constructed wetlands are increasingly being designed and used to treat wastewaters. Majority of constructed wetlands are designed based on steady-state releases of pollutants loading. However, in some cases (i.e. aquaculture ponds) pollutant loadings are not steady-state, rather are intermittent. Pollutants transport analysis based on steady-state release (inflow) will be quite different from an analysis based on intermittent loading/inflow. In the past several studies were conducted on pollutants transport and degradation through wetlands using steady-state inflow of pollutants. In this paper, a simple numerical model is proposed and developed based on conservation of mass principle for the pollutants and transport through a wetland, considering a series of tanks. Tank-in-series approach assumes that the wetland is comprised of several interconnected tanks, each of which can be modeled as a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. As for pollutants, in this study organic matters are considered. Same numerical model can be used for different organic matters, considering different values of degradation rate. Using first-order kinetic equations of pollutants transport and degradation and applying Euler's method of difference equations a numerical model was developed. Developed numerical model can simulate pollutant transport and degradations for steady- state, continuous and/or irregular/intermittent pollutant loadings. Numerical model results were verified with earlier developed analytical solutions for intermittent pollutant loadings, which were applied for aquaculture ponds in Texas (USA). Numerical model results are close to the results derived from analytical solutions for the same condition. Reasons of some primary discrepancies are discussed. Developed numerical model was used to present different scenario using different flow rates, pond volumes and different masses of intermittent pollutants. It is found that all of these parameters have significant impact on outflow pollutants' concentrations.

AB  - Much of Australian railway tracks traverse coastal areas containing soft soils and marine deposits. Pre-construction stabilization of soft formation soils by applying a surcharge load alone often takes too long. The installation of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) can reduce the preloading period significantly by decreasing the drainage path length, sometimes by a factor of 10 or more. The analytical solution based on actual radial soil permeability is proposed considering the variation of vacuum pressure, and the Cavity Expansion Theory is employed to predict the smear zone caused by the installation of mandrel driven vertical drains. The predicted smear zone and the effect of drain unsaturation are compared with data obtained from a large-scale radial consolidation tests and the results are explained. When a higher load is required to meet the desired rate of settlement and the cost of surcharge is also significant, the application of vacuum pressure with reduced surcharge loading can be used. In this method, an external negative load is applied to the soil surface in the form of vacuum pressure through a sealed membrane system. The applied vacuum pressure generates negative pore water pressure, resulting in an increase in effective stress and accelerated consolidation, also avoiding the need for a high surcharge embankment. The analytical and numerical analyses incorporating the authors' equivalent plane strain solution for both Darcian and non-Dracian flow are conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements and several selected case histories are analysed and presented. Cyclic loading of PVDs is also examined in the laboratory in a manner appropriate for railway environments. It is shown that short PVDs can dissipate excess pore pressure as fast as they are built up under repeated loading conditions. The research findings verify that the impact of smear and vacuum pressure can significantly affect soil consolidation, and these aspects need to be simulated properly in the selected numerical approach. Finally, the use of native vegetation to stabilise soft soils in railway environment is discussed with the aid of preliminary suction models developed on the basis of evapotranspiration mechanics applied to tree roots.

AB  - This study clarified the centennial-scale changes in meiobenthic bay ostracod assemblages in Japan over the past approximately 3000 years with relation to various human-induced and natural environmental factors. These factors were inferred via integrated multiproxy methods of high-resolution geological analyses of core sediments obtained from a shallow bay off a coastal plain, along with literature surveys of archeological and historical records. Five intervals were defined based on multivariate analyses of ostracod assemblages. The ostracod assemblage was stable before around the 6th century because of aggradational sedimentation related to gradual increases in sea level. Since then, the composite factors such as the development of a sandy spit near the study site, stable sea level, regional tectonics, regional centennial-scale climatic change possibly related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and flood mitigation by human settlement in the coastal plains triggered the formation of tidal flats and subtidal sandy areas with seagrass beds. This has markedly influenced offshore bay ostracod assemblages since around the 12th century. Anthropogenic impacts, such as reclamation and various artificial constructions since the late 20th century caused the disappearance of seagrass beds, input of coarser sediment into offshore bays, and increased nutrient loads. Therefore, ostracod assemblages have changed drastically. Ostracod assemblages near the boundary between land and sea have been affected by multiple complex factors, such as regional climate and depositional and human-induced processes during the Late Holocene. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bangladesh through its complex network of river systems drains an area of about 1.76 million sq. km of the catchment of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna of which only 7.5 percent lies in Bangladesh. The Sundarbans is situated in the Ganges catchment area which known as the single largest mangrove forest and a unique ecosystems in the world. It is representing 3.5 percent of the world mangrove and consisting of an area 6017 sq.km. It is a natural shield that protects the coastal area from storm surges and cyclones in pre and post monsoon periods. Since the diversion of Ganges water at Farakka Barrage in India from early 1975, capillary upward movement of soluble salts due to presence flows while the industries are facing serious problems in quality control of the products and disastrous effects on agriculture, fisheries, navigation, hydromorphology, drinking water, wetlands and mangrove ecosystems. Chemical factors like salinity, pH, oxidation reduction, potential mineral contents, marine pollution, sedimentation etc are the major ones which influence the development of management forest. Consequently both siltation and salinity have increased in the Sundarbans region. The dominant Sundari (Heritierafomes) are affected by top-dying disease which is recognised as key management concern. The Ganges water sharing is not just a geo-techno-political problem it is also a human problem. Interaction is needed between states where it is a common concern. The objectives of this paper is to contribute to formulate a long-term management plan for mangrove wetlands resources through ensure to supply Ganges water into Sundarbans. GIS simulation and modelling would be a proper tools for decision making and make recommendations for the protection of Sundarbans ecosystems.

AB  - ABSTRACT Within the past 100 years, 25 hurricanes have struck the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Apalachicola, Florida. During the passage of the storms, marginal coastal lowlands were often flooded, passes from coastal estuaries to the sea were heavily eroded, and the size and position of offshore barrier islands suffered significant modification. Not generally observed, however, were changes that took place in the submarine environment. These changes, from a geological standpoint, were equally impressive. Investigations have now confirmed that the passage of Hurricane Elena near Apalachicola Bay, Florida, in 1985, caused severe scouring of the bottom of the bay and also the resuspension and removal of over 80 million tons of sediment from the bay in a period of some 8 to 10 hours. Mobile Bay, similarly, was impacted by Hurricane Frederic, in 1979. The passage of this storm caused an overall deepening of the bay of approximately 1.5 feet and the removal of nearly 290 million tons of sediment in a period of 7 hours. This is especially striking when it is realized that this amount of sediment is nearly equivalent to that delivered by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico during one entire year! Obviously, such events also must have taken place in the geological past. While no unequivocal means probably exists to identify positively storm events in ancient sediments, detailed examination of sediment cores from Apalachicola Bay, Florida, strongly suggests that passage of major storms does leave a discernible imprint. Abrupt changes in particle median diameters, sorting coefficients, and percentages of sand-sized sediment, when viewed simultaneously, may offer such a possibility. When these parameters are determined and plotted for closely spaced samples from cores, and the cores are laid side-by-side, the simultaneous occurrence of abrupt changes in median diameter, sorting, and sand percent is strongly suspicious of a storm event. While such changes also might be explained by other causes, the likelihood of these is significantly lower than changes caused by major hurricanes, given the frequency of occurrence of storms in the Gulf's historical past.

AB  - The most important problems with a negative impact for Romanian coast, the erosion phenomen, are given by the numerous conflicts between the development of various economic activities and it is necessary to implement a system for preventing the further deterioration of shoreline. Coastal protection systems can be represented by linear structures perpendicular to the shore, called groynes. The groynes trapping sand on the upstream side and in this way, protect the coast behind the sand filet. The protection depends on the stability of this sand filet under extreme conditions. Groynes can have special shapes and depends the type of protection which is necessary. In this paper we propose to analyze the influence of groynes on the shoreline, including the sediment transport, taking into account the type of coastal zone. We will see the coastal profile, the distribution of the littoral drift in the coastal profile and the evolution of the shore according to different sizes of groynes over a set time period. The erosion problem will be solved only on the upstream side of the groyne for a length and depends on the length of the groyne for the given wave climate.

AB  - The River Taf forms a small macrotidal estuary impounded by a coastal barrier and opening into a shallow Carmarthen Bay (southwest Wales). Periodic estimates of the sand budget over a ten-year period show that sand is accumulating in the estuary at a mean vertical rate of 0.13 m or more per year. The rise of sand level is two orders of magnitude greater than the present-day rise of sea level. Abundant textural and some mineralogical evidence proves this sand to be of marine origin. The rate of accumulation is related to the frequency of westerly waves which move sand landwards from Carmarthen Bay. This sand is distinctive in its uniformity of texture but multiplicity of sedimentary structures. Neither the mean grain size nor the majority of structures reflect the high energy of the environment. Although the direction of net transport is landwards, most of the small-scale structures face seawards. The tide within the estuary is markedly asymmetrical, the flood being shorter than the ebb. Because sand is infilling the estuary, a spring tide must rise up to 2 m from low water mark before it can enter, and this takes several hours, by which time the flood is well advanced in the bay. Fast flood currents (up to 1.8 m/s), amplified at the constricted estuary mouth, are generated as the tide pours in. Fast ebb currents also develop, particularly when river flow is high, as shoals become exposed and water is confined to the main channels. Circulation varies from moderately stratified to well-mixed. Hence storm waves from the Atlantic are pushing sand into the estuary from Carmarthen Bay, and the accumulating sand in turn dictates the unusual estuarine dynamics.

AB  - Extensive Salicornia beds along the Gulf of Kutchchh (northwest) and Tamilnadu (southeast) coasts were investigated with respect to vegetative structure and ambient environmental conditions. The width of the beds varied from approximately 5 m to 1000 m, depending upon the topography and tidal influence. The most extensive and healthy stands occurred in the regularly (20-50 tides month-1) inundated intertidal zones. The width of Salicornia beds in the Gulf of Kutchchh was greater than those along the Tamilnadu coast due to greater (0.83-7.2 m) tidal amplitude and flat topography. The sediments from beds of the Gulf of Kutchchh were rich (4.9-16.9 % dry weight) in organic matter. The salt content in the sediments from Tamilnadu was relatively very low (0.08-0.1 % dry weight) compared to sediments from the Gulf of Kutchchh (0.48-0.78 % dry weight). Plant biomass, density, height, and frequency of occurrence in the more frequently inundated regions were greater than in the poorly or less frequently inundated intertidal regions. The average total biomass varied from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (dry weight) m-2 and was mostly comprised of aboveground components. Peak biomass values of Salicornia were observed during September to February in the Gulf of Kutchchh, while along the southeast coast, they were observed during December to March. The growth of the S. brachiata seemed to be influenced primarily by the frequency of inundation, duration of atmospheric exposure at ebb tide, rainfall, and salinity and salt content of the ambient water and sediments, respectively. Average carbon and nitrogen content in the plants were estimated to be 21.7 c 1.9 % and 0.8 c 0.17 % (dry weight), respectively. The carbon content increased with increasing age of the plant, while protein content decreased. Constantly increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal wetlands warrant immediate protection of S. brachiata and other obligate halophytes, which are either threatened /vulnerable or endangered.

AB  - A small but diverse assemblage of pollen and spores recovered from marine sediments of the Avon Park Formation (middle Eocene) in west central Florida, represents the oldest land flora described from the state. Twenty-one pollen taxa from terrestrial plants, are identified from the Dolime Minerals and Gulf Hammock quarries. The presence of mangrove pollen associates such as Acrostichum, Nypa, and Pelliciera associated with seagrass macrofossils, combined with evidence from invertebrate fossils and sedimentary structures, suggest that the sediments of the Avon Park Formation, at these quarry sites, were deposited in a shallow marine lagoon, perhaps near the mouth of a river or stream in a protected area that had some tidal influence. This is the earliest report of terrestrial vegetation and near marine vegetation of Florida and documents the presence of a Florida landmass during middle Eocene time.

AB  - Earthen levees protecting coastal regions can be exposed to compound flooding induced by multiple drivers such as coastal water level, river discharge, and precipitation. However, the majority of flood hazard analyses consider only one flood driver at a time. This study numerically investigates the performance of an earthen levee in Sherman Island, Sacramento, CA, under compound flooding induced by fluvial and pluvial flooding. A finite element model is built for fully coupled 3D stress-flow simulations of the levee. The finite element model is then used to simulate the hydro-mechanical response of the levee under different flood scenarios. Fluvial flood hydrographs for different scenarios are obtained using a bivariate extreme analysis of peak river discharge and peak ocean level while accounting for the significance of correlation between these two variables. Pluvial flooding is characterized using intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves of extreme precipitations for the study area. The fluvial and pluvial flood patterns for different recurrence intervals are used in the finite element model to simulate the hydro-mechanical response of the levee. Results show that considering compound flooding leads to 8.7% and 18.6% reduction in the factor of safety for 2 and 50-year recurrence intervals, respectively. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In connection with hydraulic studies of a new coastal resort development on the south-east coast of Bali Indonesia, a three-dimensional (3D) physical study was carried out to determine the wave transformation over a shallow natural reef in front of the resort and for the design of the rubble mound revetments to be built for coastal protection. Due to the limited water depth, the wave conditions were dominated by heavy wave breaking and the associated release of the bound long-period wave components in the wave groups of the incident wave train. The depth-limited wave conditions on the reef and the dynamic water level set-up significantly influenced the evolution of damage and overtopping of the revetments consequently making the design of the revetments complex.

AB  - Ljubljana marsh in Slovenia is a 16 000 ha area of partly drained fen, intended to be flooded to restore its ecological functions. The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (630 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization (CO sub(2) and CH sub(4) production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding (>5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period and was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H sub(2) and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14-38C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91%) mcrA (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found. Our results suggest that methane emission can remain transient and low if water-table fluctuations allow re-oxidation of ferrous iron, sustaining iron reduction as the most important process in terminal carbon mineralization.

AB  - Biochar substrates and tidal flow (TF) and intermittent aeration (IA) operation modes have recently been applied to improve the treatment performance of constructed wetlands (CWs), but their roles in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from CWs are still unclear. In this preliminary study, CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes and associated microbial characteristics in four groups of subsurface-flow CWs, that is, ceramsite CWs (C-CWs), biochar-amended CWs (B-CWs), intermittently aerated B-CWs (AB-CWs), and tide-flow B-CWs (TB-CWs), were comparatively investigated. The results showed that biochar amendment significantly mitigated CH4 and N2O fluxes from the CWs by supporting higher abundances of mcrA and nosZ genes and higher ratios of pmoA/mcrA and nosZ/(nirK + nirS), thus reducing global warming potential (GWP, a decrease of 55.8%), in addition to promoting total nitrogen (TN) removal by 41.3%, mainly by increasing the abundances and activities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The TF mode efficiently improved nitrogen removal, but it greatly increased GHG fluxes since large amounts of GHGs escaped from the empty CW matrix after water draining. IA abated GHG emissions from the CWs, mainly after aeration. TF and IA decreased the abundances of functional bacteria and archaea related to C and N transformation, except nitrifiers, and shaped the microbial community structures. The application of a biochar substrate and IA mode can facilitate the design and operation of CWs in a more ecologically sustainable way.

AB  - With the global mean sea level rising, coastal regions will be flooded by causing substantial domestic gross losses. In tropical and subtropical regions, coral reefs exist along coastlines around the world. Most of the energy in the waves would be eliminated by coming across the coastal barrier. The extended lagoons and steep flanks of most fringing reefs produce unique surf zone processes and they are the natural ports for the fishmen and the boats with small draft. Using this analytical solution, the global characteristics of the wave propagating over submerged plate barrier considering the geometric and the incident wave parameters are analyzed with great efforts. It shows that the width of the plate barrier and the depth of the shallow water play important roles to eliminate the incident wave. The wave parameters are changed remarkably over the submerged plate barrier besides the wave period or frequency. The wave transmission coefficients are also obtained by contrasting the amplitudes of the incident wave and the diffracted one without breaking. However, the wave breaking plays more significant role to eliminate the incident wave than the submerged barrier. The role of the submerged barrier is mostly under-estimated for reflecting and dissipating incident wave because the wave breaking and the turbulent would dissipate the wave energy. The wave breaking and the turbulent which are not included in this potential fluid model and they should be investigated in detail in the future. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - (1) Simulations of wave action and erosion, using a wave-producing device and a recirculating flume, were established on the Haigang mudflat, in the Yellow River estuary, China, along with the geotechnical-parameter tests of the water content, bulk density, undrained shear strength, penetration strength, and grain-size distribution. Moreover, the variety of seabed morphological characteristics under different wave actions was also observed in field. The experimental results showed that the erodibility of the silty sediment was significantly affected by the cyclic wave loading in Yellow River estuary. The erodibility varied with the changing wave loading and was closely related to the liquefaction and topography characteristics of the surficial sediment, which restricted the physical and mechanical properties of the sediment. Additionally, the wave loading transformed the sediment components and the size grading, which also had a remarkable effect on the erodibility. Increasing the length of the time vibration during wave loading clearly reduced erosion resistivity, although fluctuations appeared in the overall downward trend, consistent with the strength indexes of the silty sediment.

AB  - ABSTRACT California has initiated a new approach to create an objective standard and regulate best achievable protection (BAP) for sensitive shoreline protection from vessel spills. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) and California's Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act (SB 2040) mandate BAP as the standard for preparedness and response. BAP poses the critical response planning questions: “How much response resources should industry provide?” and “In what timeframes should those resources be deployed?” Prior California regulations intended to achieve BAP by relying on vessels to identify hazards, trajectories, environmental consequences, and response resource plans, produced less than optimal results in many instances. Though effective in theory, this approach resulted in fuzzy consequences and vague arrangements for adequate response. Because it was neither clear what sites would be protected (and what response resources would be required) nor at what time, and because it was consequ...

AB  - Distribution and habitat use are presented on the 50 most abundant fish species captured in shallow nearshore waters (+ADw-20 m offshore and +ADw- 5 m) deep relative to mean lower low water (MLLW) of southeastern Alaska. Fish were captured with a beach seine at 41 locations from 1998 to 2004. At each location, habitats sampled included sand or gravel beaches with no attached vegetation, cobble beaches with understory kelps (e.g., Laminaria saccharina), soft bottom (sand, silt, or mud) beaches with eelgrass (Zostera marina), and steep bedrock outcrops. A total of 538 seince hauls yielded 449,166 fish. Based on total catch, the three most abundant species were walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). Mean catch per seine haul was greatest in eelgrass for 30 of the 50 most abundant species. Juveniles dominated the catch of all species captured. For example, mean size of walleye pollock, Pacific sand lance, and Pacific herring was less than 100 mm fork length. Distribution patterns were evident for many fish species+ADs- some are widely distributed throughout southeastern Alaska (crescent gunnel, Pholis laeta), whereas others are confined to southern waters (kelp perch, Brachyistius frenatus) or more outside coastal waters (black rockfish, Sebastes melanops). Shallow nearshore waters support a diverse and abundant community of fishes, many of commercial importance. Information on distribution and habitat of nearshore fish assemblages will help resource managers identify and protect coastal areas at risk to human disturbance.

AB  - In modelling the transport of phosphorus (P), soil erosion during storm-flow events and associated transport of particulates in the hydrological network are usually assumed to be the major processes involved in export from non-point-sources. This simplifying assumption is adopted in the light of the strong affinity of P for the soil solid phase and the high particulate P concentrations generally measured downstream of various agricultural catchments. Recent studies centred on the Lake Geneva catchment show that there is a considerable spatial and temporal variability of P species exported in surface runoff associated with storm-flow events. This variability in P export results from interactions between different types of flow, whose structural and soil moisture conditions (globally driven by seasonal trends) mainly control the water flow pathway on the catchment, and a set of P stocks of variable mobilities and availabilities that are distributed according to land use and topography. P losses from soils do not necessarily imply export at the outlet of the catchment basin, since intervening buffer zones (e.g. field margins, meadows, marshlands, etc.) modify the transfer of P. These buffer zones are capable of storing permanently or temporarily a portion of the transferred P and restoring it at least partially during subsequent storm-flow events, sometimes with transformation of the P species. The hydrographic network (particularly that part associated with sediments and banks) acts sometimes as a sink and sometimes as a source of P. All these compartments modify the quantities exported at the outlet, their speciation, and the timing of export. On this basis, we propose a conceptual model of the transfer of P in small catchments, integrating the role of morpho-pedological pattern and other characteristics of the landscape. For each storm-flow event, the model defines a hydrochemical pattern of outlet P losses, allowing an annual cycle of P emission to be defined, along with the corresponding dominant species of P, and the potential impact on lake waters. This kind of model throws into relief the various scales and components needed for control water quality at the respective scales of agricultural plots, inter-field structures and hydrographic networks, as well as the different human actors involved.

AB  - The Quaternary deposits of the Hanoi area have been investigated in order to provide information required for the design of a groundwater-flow model. Limited sedimentological data exist from 32 destructive drillings carried out previously in the study area. The data base contains hydrographical and hydrogeological observations, but few sedimentological details. This is in contrast with the more seaward regions of the area where the Holocene deposits of the Red River plain has previously been studied. However, a comparison of the results obtained in this study with the previous studies indicates that the Hanoi sediment succession developed in an incised valley under conditions of rapid relative sea-level rise until ca. 7-6 a cal BP. The succession consists initially of alluvial floodplain deposits conformably overlain by mud deposited at the head of an estuary which filled with continuing rapid sea-level rise. Once the relative sea-level rise stabilized, fluvial deposition prograded over the adjacent estuarine mud. The development of a groundwater-flow model requires knowledge of the three-dimensional distribution of the various deposits. Despite the paucity of information with respect to sediment description, a model of the entire Quaternary sequence is presented in several lithostratigraphic crosssections and a panel diagram. The latter forms the basis for the construction of a contour map of the base of the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and for a sequence map of the Quaternary deposits in the study area.

AB  - In this study the use of a hybrid shoreline model, namely the Mike21FM Shoreline Model, has been applied to investigate the effectiveness of three different coastal protection schemes for Palm Beach in Southern Queensland, Australia. The yearly littoral drift on this shoreline is approximately 500,000 m3 to the north. The three coastal protection schemes are: Nourishment, Nourishment plus a submerged control structure and Nourishment plus artificial headlands. The coastal impact due to the three schemes is quantified and compared using the shoreline model. The results assisted the Gold Coast City Council in their decision on which option to bring forward to the detailed design phase.

AB  - Tidal dissipation is a major heat source for the icy satellites of the giant planets. Several icy satellites likely possess a subsurface ocean underneath an ice shell. Previous studies of tidal dissipation on icy satellites, however, have either assumed a static ocean or ignored the effect of the ice lid on subsurface ocean dynamics. In this study, we examine inertial effects on tidal deformation of satellites with a dynamic ocean overlain by an ice lid based on viscoelasto-gravitational theory. Although ocean dynamics is treated in a simplified fashion, we find a resonant configuration when the phase velocity of ocean gravity waves is similar to that of the tidal bulge. This condition is achieved when a subsurface ocean is thin (<1 km). The enhanced deformation (increased h2 and k2 Love numbers) near the resonant configuration would lead to enhanced tidal heating in the solid lid. A static ocean formulation gives an accurate result only if the ocean thickness is much larger than the resonant thickness. The resonant configuration strongly depends on the properties of the shell, demonstrating the importance of the presence of a shell on tidal dissipation.

AB  - In accordance with the current Russian normative documents, determining wave loads and impacts on hydraulic structures should be calibrated by field measurements and laboratory studies. However, it is problematic to satisfy this norm, because there are no measured wave parameters for the main coastal areas. Moreover, the equivalent virtually designed waves cannot be compared directly with the measured real ones. The situation may be improved by the method of reanalyzing meteorological conditions for the region within 30-50 years and then modeling dangerous storms. The method of reanalysis has been applied for the coastal zone in Imeretinskaya Lowland in Sochi to develop the coastal protection structures. The calculated waves have been compared to the existing buoy measurement (Gelendzhik) and coastal wave station's measurement (Sochi). It is advisable to take field measurement of waves with near-bottom pressure gauges. They are acceptable for complicated conditions. Surface waves are calculated by wave theory.

AB  - The number of marine species at risk of extinction is rising. Understanding the threats that contribute to extinction risk in the seas is thus critical to conservation. When major threats to marine, estuarine, and diadromous species on the US Endangered Species Act and IUCN Red lists were ranked according to the number of species they affect, strong consensus in the ranking of threats across species and between institutions emerged. Overexploitation is the most frequent threat to vulnerable marine species, with approximately half of threatened species caught as bycatch in fisheries. Habitat degradation, the primary threat to terrestrial species, ranks second in impact on marine species. Loss of listed marine species would probably affect ecosystem function and delivery of ecosystem services because many of these species are strong interactors, including ecosystem engineers, taxa that provide important nutrient links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and a disproportionate number of high trophic-level predators. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Coastal habitats in the United States have been in decline for centuries, while federal and state policy programs to address their decline have only been developed and implemented over the past few decades. This study set out to understand—based on existing policy, published academic and grey literature, and expert perspectives—the status and stressors for four focal habitats and state governments’ approaches to their restoration and protection. While the report includes illustrative examples of local and state level governmental interventions designed for and, at times, demonstrably effective at protecting and restoring coastal habitats, the key findings suggest that state coastal management remains fragmented and enabling conditions for effective policy hard to identify and therefore are not replicated across states.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a study of the use of bioengineered erosion control structures on Alaskan streams and rivers. Field investigations of hydraulic and vegetation conditions at 11 study sites around the state of Alaska were conducted to determine the performance of these structures. Root wads, live staking, brush layering, and coir logs were the primary bioengineering methods used for erosion control at the study sites. A one-dimensional numerical computer model was applied at each site to estimate the magnitude of average bed and bank shear stresses (tractive force) apparent to the erosion control structures at the 50- and 100-year design flood levels. Discharge records and field flood indicators were checked to correlate structure condition to flow history. Damage at existing structures was attributed to flowing ice, undermining of toe protection, buoyancy effects, and failure of construction fabrics. Root wad structures in good condition were located in areas with high boat wake occurrence but low channel tractive forces. The findings of the study suggest that the types of bioengineered erosion control structures studied have not been proven to offer reliable bank erosion protection during flooding conditions on channels with high tractive forces.

AB  - Neighborhood pond associations have proven to be an especially effective force in the protection and enhancement of local coastal ecosystems. Environmental managers who are wise enough to forge partnerships with these local organizations will be rewarded with the energy, commitment, and passion reserved for issues that hit close to home. With the vigilante zeal of a Neighborhood Crime Watch, local pond associations are the eyes and ears that sound the first alerts of environmental pollution. With the efficiency of a local militia, they rally to the cause as volunteers with financial commitment and effective political organization. The environmental accomplishments of neighborhood groups on Martha's Vineyard are impressive. The Edgartown Harbor Association funded a water quality study resulting in the establishment of a free septage pumpout facility for boaters. The Friends of Sengekontacket (Pond) provided the leadership to coordinate a local, state and federal partnership to complete a major dredging project which restored filled shellfish habitat and nourished an eroding barrier beach. The Lagoon Pond Association funded a court battle to limit pier construction. The Tisbury Great Pond Think Tank and Tisbury Water Ways have addressed farm and roadway runoff with fencing, buffer strips and innovative catch basins. All of the associations have conducted successful public education programs, water quality monitoring studies, protective zoning initiatives and fundraising activities to protect shellfish habitats and water quality.

AB  - The existing knowledge on the sources, distribution, and composition of marine debris worldwide and its impact on marine wildlife as well as the economy, were reviewed by bringing together most of the relevant literature published so far. Marine debris (or marine litter), defined as any manufactured or processed solid material that enters the marine environment, is a greatly underestimated component of marine pollution. Although there are various types of litter, plastics (synthetic organic polymers) make up most of the marine debris worldwide. The important properties (light, strong, resistant to degradation, and low-cost) that make plastics so widely used are also the reasons why plastics are a serious hazard to the marine environment, where they gradually accumulate and may persist for decades. Most marine debris originates from land-based activities, and the main sources include storm water discharges, municipal landfills located near the coast, riverine transport of waste from landfills and other sources, discharges of untreated municipal sewage, the plastic industry and other industrial facilities, unregulated disposal of litter due to absence of waste services or landfills, tourism, all types of vessels, offshore oil and gas platforms, and aquaculture installations. Litter may concentrate on the seafloor and reaches very high densities, especially in coastal areas but also in some accumulation zones in the open sea. Densities that reach many thousands or even millions of items per hectare have been reported on the seafloor or along beaches. Marine debris is a serious threat to marine life and may negatively affect the populations of many species. The entanglement of marine species, especially marine mammals, seabirds, turtles, fish, and crustaceans has been frequently described as a serious mortality factor. Marine species may ingest debris items (mostly plastics), presumably mistaking them for prey, which has many harmful effects on their physical condition and survival. Toxic contaminants like PCBs may enter marine food chains through ingested plastics with potentially very negative effects. Drift debris can increase the distribution range of certain marine organisms and assist in the invasion of alien species, which is a primary threat to global biodiversity. High marine litter densities have a potential effect on the structure of benthic communities by altering the characteristics of the local biotope, and may act as the means for the invasion of many hard-substratum species that could displace indigenous fauna due to competition or predation. Marine debris, especially derelict fishing gear, causes substantial damage to coral reefs and coral facies. Marine debris has a considerable economic impact, mainly due to lost tourism, reduction of commercial fish and crustaceans stocks due to ghost fishing, the time and expense of rescue operations for entangled or damaged vessels, costs of clean ups of beaches and coral or rocky reefs, and increased conservation costs of endangered marine species. The effect of marine debris on both marine fauna and the human economy is expected to become a more prominent issue in the future as marine debris concentration in the marine environment continuously increases. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Japan has been constructing long coastal defense since the storm surge disaster with a loss of 5,000 lives by Typhoon Vera in 1959. The defense is designed for the storm water level including the storm surge of the standard typhoon based on Typhoon Vera. Stochastic typhoon model, simulating various typhoon track and intensity with Monte Carlo method, is one of useful tools to estimate the return period. According to recent research output the return period of the storm surge of the standard typhoon is near 100 years or more at three major bays in Japan. But there is uncertainty by some of parameters and models in the stochastic simulation. Sea surface drag coefficient under high wind speed and future change in typhoon intensity and track are critical to extreme values of the storm surges.

AB  - Following the Painted Cave Fire of 25 June 1990 in Santa Barbara, California which burned 1214 ha, an emergency watershed protection plan was implemented consisting of stream clearing, grade stabilizers and construction of debris basins. Research was initiated focusing on hydrological response and channel morphology changes on two branches of Maria Ygnacio Creek, the main drainage of the burned area. Research results support the hypothesis that the response of small drainage basins in chaparral ecosystems to wildfire is complex and flushing of sediment by fluvial processes is more likely than by high magnitude debris flows. During the winter of 1990-1991, 35-66 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 10 cm per hour for a five-minute period were recorded with a seasonal total of 100% of average (normal) rainfall (average = 63 cm/year). During the winter of 1991-1992, 48-74 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 8 cm per hour were recorded with a seasonal total of 115% of normal. Even though there was moderate rainfall on barren, saturated soils, no major debris flows occurred in burned areas. The winter of 1992-1993 recorded total precipitation of about 170% of normal, annual average intensities were relatively low and again no debris flows were observed. The response to winter storms in the first three years following the fire was a moderate but spectacular flushing of sediment, most of which was derived from the hillslopes upstream of the debris basins. The first significant storm and stream flow of the 1990-1991 winter was transport-limited resulting in large volumes of sediment being deposited in the channel of Maria Ygnacio Creek; the second storm and stream flow was sediment-limited and the channel scoured. Debris basins trapped about 23 000 m(3), the majority coming from the storm of 17-20 March 1991. Sediment transported downstream during the three winters following the fire and not trapped in the debris basins was eventually flushed to the estuarine reaches of the creeks below the burn area, where approximately 108 000 m(3) accumulated. Changes in stream morphology following the fire were dramatic as pools filled with sediment which greatly smoothed longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. Major changes in channel morphology occur following a fire as sediment derived from the hillslope is temporarily stored in channels within the burned area. However, this sediment may quickly move downstream of the burned region, where it may accumulate reducing channel capacity and increasing the flood hazard. Ecological consequences of wildfire to the riparian zone of streams in the chaparral environment are virtually unknown, but must be significant as the majority of sediment (particularly gravel necessary for fish and other aquatic organisms) entering the system does so in response to fires.

AB  - Based on present rates of accelerating land loss, restoration of coastal wetlands in Louisiana will be compromised if offshore exploration does not locate sufficient compatible sand and suitable sediment for restoration of coastal Louisiana in general and barrier islands in particular. Non-availability of easily accessible compatible sand or mixed sediment (sand plus silt) leaves the populace and ecosystem of coastal Louisiana at risk and adversely impacts the nation's oil and gas industries. It is clear that restoration of wetlands and barrier islands is critically dependent on both quality and quantity of suitable sediment. It is thus imperative that a proper sediment management plan be developed to meet long term needs. Presently, exploration for sand and mixed sediments is guided by project-specific protocols. The cost as well as the success of a project is defined by the sediment selection process. Better planning and management of multiple-user-conflicts requires regional understanding of sediment resources that would result in a more beneficial approach. Regional sediment management, which helps protect, preserve, and properly distribute sand and mixed sedimentary deposits, would best be achieved by inter-agency coordination so that identified sediment resources would not be subsequently traversed by oil and gas pipelines or infrastructure. Integration of sediment management plans are needed because sediment budgets are not independent systems. Instead of looking at project specific needs, it is posited that a programmatic approach be adopted to effectively manage the demand for large sediment volumes needed to restore sustainability in the Louisiana coastal zone.

AB  - The rapid degradation of Louisiana's barrier island (BI) systems adversely impacts the vitality of strategic economic and biological resources (including aquatic habitat). Louisiana's BI systems have undergone landward migration through BI rollover, area loss and island narrowing as a result of complex interactions among land subsidence, sea-level rise, wave processes, inadequate sediment supply, and intense human disturbance. Consequently, the structural continuity of the BI shorelines has weakened as the islands narrowed, fragmented and, in some cases, submerged. Several multipronged restoration strategies are currently underway to develop effective interdisciplinary restoration projects that mitigate degradation of the Mississippi River delta plain and compensate for coastal land loss. Restoration of the BI systems requires strategies that protect interior wetlands and bolster the first lines of storm defense in a post-Hurricane Katrina-Rita-Gustav-Ike-Isaac and post-Deep Water Horizon era. Coastline degradation would have continued were it not for a series of massive barrier island restoration projects. Such efforts commonly consist of beach nourishment on the Gulfside and marsh creation on the bayside of barrier islands. Regionalizing monitoring, maintenance, and data management efforts support the still evolving scientific and engineering aspects of rebuilding BIs. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Long-term variation of mean sea level has been considered the primary exogenous factor of vegetation dynamics in salt marshes. In this study we address the importance of short-term wind-induced rise of the sea surface in such biogeographic changes. There was an unusual opportunity for examining field data on plant species frequency sea-level variation and sedimentation acquired from the Skallingen salt marsh in Denmark since the 1930s. The environmental and floristic history of Skallingen was summarized as (1) continuous sea-level rise with temporal variability (2.3-5.0 mm yr-1) (2) continuous sedimentation with spatial variability (2.0-4.0 mm yr-1) (3) increased frequency of over-marsh flooding events and (4) contemporary dominance of Halimione portulacoides indicating little progressive succession toward a later phase. Conventionally recent eustatic sea-level rise was believed to drive the increased frequency of flooding and such retarded succession. Skallingen however has showed more or less equilibrated yearly rates between sea-level rise and surface accretion. This implies that the long-term gradual sea-level rise alone might not be enough to explain the increased inundation frequency across the marsh. Here we suggest an alternative chain: Recent trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation index toward its positive phase have led to increased storminess and wind tides on the ocean surface resulting in increased frequency duration and depth of submergence and hence waterlogging of marsh soils which has retarded ecological succession. To conclude we stress the need for a multitemporal perspective that recognizes the significance of short-term sea-level fluctuations nested within long-term trends. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.

AB  - The deltas at Nakdong Estuary may experience environmental impact because of the construction of Busan New Port. There are several physical properties which can influence the bathymetric change at the area. The effect of the New Port on the future bathymetric changes of the deltas was examined in three main directions: the tidal current, wave and wave-induced current, and river flood. This paper describes the tidal current environment and the consequent bathymetric change before and after the construction of the Busan New Port and the Nakdong Tidal Barrage. The model results show that the new port will reduce the tidal current speed around the construction site, but not significantly influence the flows around the river mouth area.

Korea has achieved both economical and socio-cultural developments in recent years, and in the midst of these changes, the issue of beach erosion has been recognized as one of the most important and controversial coastal problems in the country. Hence coastal protection is required which they have to be designed, constructed and maintained efficiently (Pilarczyk and Zeidler, 1996). This case study on beach erosion was conducted at Haeundae Beach in Busan, located in the south coast of Korea. Haeundae Beach is regarded as the most popular and beautiful urban beach in Korea. One of the main purposes of this study is to take comprehensive countermeasures to mitigate the beach erosion problem at Haeundae Beach. The historical investigations, field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted to unde...

AB  - This study focuses on sediment exchange dynamics in Mwache Creek, a shallow tidal mangrove wetland In Kenya. The surface area of the creek is 17 km(2) at high water spring. The creek experiences semidiumal tides with tidal ranges of 3.2 m and 1.4 m during spring and neap tides, respectively. The creek is ebb dominant in the frontwater zone main channel and is flood dominant in the backwater zone main channel. During rainy season the creek receives freshwater and terrigenous sediments from the seasonal Mwache River. Heavy supply of terrigenous sediments during the El Nino of 1997-1998 led to the huge deposition of sediments (10(6) tonnes) in the wetland that caused massive destruction of the mangrove forest in the upper region. In this study, sea level, tidal discharges, tidal current velocities, salinity, total suspended sediment concentrations (TSSC) and particulate organic sediment concentrations (POSC) measured in stations established within the main channel and also within the mangrove forests, were used to determine the dynamics of sediment exchange between the frontwater and backwater zones of the main channel including also the exchange with mangrove forests. The results showed that during wet seasons, the high suspended sediment concentration associated with river discharge and tidal resuspension of fine channel-bed sediment accounts for the inflow of highly turbid water into the degraded mangrove forest. Despite the degradation of the mangrove forest, sediment outflow from the mangrove forest was considerably less than the inflow. This caused a net trapping of sediment in the wetland. The net import of the sediment dominated in spring tide during both wet and dry season and during neap tide in the wet season. However, as compared to heavily vegetated mangrove wetlands, the generally degraded Mwache Creek mangrove wetland sediment trapping efficiency is low as the average is about 30% for the highly degraded backwater zone mangrove forest and 65% in the moderately degraded frontwater zone mangrove forest.

AB  - The Beresford shoreline, Australia, is subject to a complex interaction of coastal processes and associated erosion. In support of the design of a coastal protection scheme a SWASH model has been set up capable of accounting for all the complex processes at hand. The model has successfully been validated against measured wave and current conditions. In the design process the validated SWASH model proved to be a valuable tool to assess the impact of various coastal protection schemes like groynes on the wave-driven current patterns and associated sediment pathways.

AB  - Conference Title: 2004 USA-Baltic Internation Symposium Conference Start Date: 2004, June 15 Conference End Date: 2004, June 17 Conference Location: Klaipeda, Lithuania To protect and restore coastal ecosystems, scientists and managers need reliable, up-to-date information on how and why these systems are changing. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft offer cost-effective means for determining the rates and causes of ecosystem changes. The U. D. Center for Remote Sensing has been developing remote sensing techniques for observing changes of landscape-level, coastal environmental indicators, including wetland size, biomass, fragmentation; invasive species; riparian buffers; estuarine suspended sediment and chlorophyll concentrations. One particularly useful result is a method for detecting changes of wetland and upland vegetation using biomass as an indicator. By employing a vegetation index (MSAVI) which is locally normalized, we minimize the effects of atmospheric, weather and seasonal differences between images in a time series. This model is applied to a time-series of medium resolution (30 m) Landsat/TM images in a GIS to identify and "flag" areas where significant change has occurred. Only the "flagged" areas are then examined in more detail with more expensive high-resolution (1-4 m) IKONOS satellite or aerial imagery.

AB  - Carbonaceous cherts in Proterozoic carbonate sequences provide an exceptionally clear record of early microbial life, but one that is significantly biased with respect to the range of environments inhabited by contemporary organisms. Many of the best preserved Proterozoic microfossil assemblages come from microbial mats and organic-rich muds that accumulated in protected coastal areas where a combination of high productivity, limited water circulation, and, often, hypersalinity limited post mortem degradation. The close distributional relationship between early diagenetic silica and organic matter can be explained in terms of a model developed by Leo and Barghoorn for the silicification of wood. Three factors appear to control the distribution of early diagenetic chert in Proterozoic sequences: sediment permeability, availability of silica in ground water solution, and locally high concentrations of organic matter in near-surface sediments. Of these, organic content appears to impose the major environmental bias. Comparison with Phanerozoic counterparts is close. from Author

AB  - Morphological and biogeographical evidence suggests that the heavy-metal ecotype of Armeria maritima (Mill,) Willd, has evolved from a hybrid group between the subspecies maritima from salt marshes and the subspecies elongata from sandy soils, As part of a study on the ecotypic differentiation in A, maritima, tn resistance was compared in populations from these three ecotypes, To study the long-term growth response to elevated Zn concentrations, an artificial soil was made from ion-exchange resin embedded in an inert sand matrix, in which metal ions were buffered by an ion-exchange system as in natural soils, In contrast to hydroponics, this artificial soil systems is suitable for long-term cultivation and it provides more reproducible growth conditions than a soil system, The long-term growth response in the artificial soil system was compared to the growth response to elevated Zn concentrations in a sand nutrient-solution system, In short-term tests, populations from non-metalliferous soils were more sensitive to Zn concentrations of 1.0 mmol l(-1) than the heavy-metal populations, However, in long-term tests, the growth of adult plants from all populations was not inhibited by Zn concentrations up to 2.8 mmol kg(-1) dry soil (equivalent 26% of cation-exchange capacity), The fn resistance of all populations could therefore be sufficient for their survival on Zn mine soils, The discrepancy between longterm tests and short-term tests is discussed with respect to the hypothesis that 'sensitive' populations may differ from 'resistant' populations in the expression of Zn-resistance mechanisms.

AB  - Northfield Ponds, a 35-acre park, is part of Denver's Stapleton Redevelopment Project, as a new mixed use 'New Urbanist' community. Engineers originally conceived the site as a storm water detention and water quality facility with little enhancement beyond the typical concrete pipes and structures, erosion control, and proposed grass seeding. The proposed design opened the area to public use yet provided native plant and wetland habitat that would contribute to the area's natural resources. The facility is organized into three 'cells' for storm water management and accommodates 1600 cfs of inflowing runoff from 460 acres of commercially developed land. A river delta typology for landforms and water courses, complete with meandering braided streams and droplet shaped islands of varying sizes, were proposed for the design. Forebays and drainage structures were designed as attractive architectural elements in the landscape. The 'delta' design concept was emphasized and enhanced with the planting design of herbaceous and woody plant material native to the West's high plains. Plantings were carefully field located to follow mapped and observed groundwater contours so that plants will sustain themselves through droughts typical to the Denver area. Bioengineering practices where used on the downstream side of the forebays with the intent of spreading water across outlets to reduce the concentration of flows that would cause channelization of the run-off. Northfield Ponds is a successful example of blending the needs of storm water management with sustainable ecological goals, creating an aesthetic and useful passive park for users to observe urban wildlife. © 2007 ASCE.

AB  - As a component of the Masonville Dredged Material Containment Facility (DMCF) project, the Maryland Port Administration (MPA) was required to develop a compensatory mitigation package to offset impacts associated with filling approximately 130 acres of open water in the Patapsco River, which is a major tributary to the Chesapeake Bay. The mitigation approved for the project is a comprehensive package of inwater and upland environmental restoration projects totaling over $20 million, primarily located adjacent to the DMCF in 90 acres of open water and 54 acres of uplands that comprise Masonville Cove. The projects serve to enhance the environment and provide improved habitat and increased wildlife use of the area, in addition to remediating contamination from historical industrial usage and dumping. The projects discussed in this paper include over 2 miles of shoreline restoration and stabilization using created fringe marshes with sandy beaches and living shorelines behind offshore rock breakwaters, 90 acres of reef creation and substrate improvement, 15 acres of creation and enhancement of tidal and non-tidal wetlands, and 30 acres of upland capping of contaminated soil. Design development concepts for these projects are presented along with reports on the completed construction that describe practical measures used to achieve the goals of the restoration.

AB  - Abstract. The White Sea of Russian Arctic is characterized by extreme diversity of enclosed estuarine systems that are often sites of unique biota. The present study focuses on surface sediments from representative restricted exchange environments of the inner part of Kandalaksha Bay, adjacent to the Karelian shore of the White Sea. The TOC and n -alkanes distribution study revealed the major input of terrestrial organic matter into the sediments from higher plants and minor presence of autochthonous microbial sources. Metal (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb) forms study showed that metals in sediments occur mainly in a biogeochemically stable mineral-incorporated form, which comprises up to 98% of total metal content, while labile (acid soluble) and organically bound (alkali soluble) forms make up to 3–11% and 2–12% of total metal content, respectively. Presumably, the major part of both acid soluble and alkali soluble forms is comprised of metals associated with easily soluble amorphous Fe-oxides and bound to sediment organic matter. According to sediment quality guidelines, all trace-metal contents were below the threshold levels. Among sites studied, the heightened contents of bioavailable metal forms are related to sediments enriched in organic matter and/or located within the sea-fresh water barrier zones. The elements studied may be arranged in the following decreasing sequence according to their potential bioavailability: Cu > Zn > Mn > Fe > Cr > Pb. The present study can serve as a basis for comprehensive environmental assessment of the region and objective anoxia prognosis in Arctic ecosystems, while the role of microbial community in element speciation in sediments needs special attention.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina did massive damage because New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were not appropriately protected. Wherever natural disasters threaten, the government - in its traditional role as public goods provider - must decide what level of protection to provide to an area. It does so by purchasing protective capital, such as levees for a low-lying city. ("Protection" also consists of not imposing threats that raise risk levels, such as draining swamps, or enhance losses, such as building in high-risk areas.) We show that if private capital is more likely to locate in better-protected areas, then the marginal social value of protection will increase with the level of protection provided. That is, the benefit function is convex, contrary to the normal assumption of concavity. When the government protects and the private sector invests, due to the ill-behaved nature of the benefit function, there may be multiple Nash equilibria. Policy makers must compare them, rather than merely follow local optimality conditions, to find the equilibrium offering the highest social welfare. There is usually considerable uncertainty about the amount of investment that will accompany any level of protection, further complicating the government's choice problem. We show that when deciding on the current level of protection, the government must take account of the option value of increasing the level of protection in the future. We briefly examine but dismiss the value of rules of thumb, such as building for 1000-year floods or other rules that ignore benefits and costs.

AB  - The paralic sediments of Delaware's Atlantic coast and estuary include a continuous depositional record of Holocene sediments from 11,000 years before present (BP). These sediments were deposited in landward migrating environments of the Holocene marine transgression superimposed and eroding into a trellis-like topography of the ancestral Delaware River (circa 15,000). By 7,000 BP, a lagoon-barrier coastal system had developed on the adjacent Atlantic coastal inner shelf area. This system has migrated landward by shoreface erosion and upward by rise in relative sea level to its present coastal position. In the lagoon, barrier, and estuarine marsh areas one can drill through and study stratigraphic sequences comprised of sediments deposited landward of and including the barrier island and barrier spit system. From this stratigraphic record, one can determine the orderly and systematic transgression landward of the coastal sedimentary environments.

AB  - The adequate initialisation of spatially varying grain size distributions of bottom sediment is one of the prime restrictions in coastal morphodynamic modelling often due to a lack of appropriate field data. Commonly, a uniform distribution in the model domain is chosen based on the author's judgement on the limited data available. In this study, a process-based morphodynamic numerical model is set up evaluating the fate of single non-cohesive grain size fractions (ranging from 100 - 2000 mu m) to determine grain size characteristics of bottom sediment based on consideration of the local hydrodynamics and morphodynamic processes. The study site is the natural barrier-enclosed meso-tidal lagoon of Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. The mean grain size values predicted by the model in the immediate inlet area are compared to values derived from a previous sampling campaign in 1978. Results indicate the potential of this approach to predict grain size distributions, provided the governing processes are adequately represented by the model.

AB  - Establishing a marine reserve constitutes one of the most important objectives for the conservation of marine environment and protection of the marine life. Palm Islands situated north Lebanon was declared as National Reserve by an official Declaration law in 1992. These three uninhabited small rocky islands situated at 6 miles offshore Al-Mina-Tripoli, constitute the only insular reserve on the Levantine coast. Amongst the seven small islands, the largest three: Palm Island, Sanani, and Ramkine, are suitable for a settlement of a marine reserve. They are distant about 800 m from each other and separated by shallow water 10-12 m with rocky bottom platform formed during the Miocene era. The rocky bottom surrounding the islands is covered with sandy, muddy sediments and gravel: The total area of the islands is 270.000 m2 and the highest point in Ramkine is 12 m above sea level. The land is swampy with few freshwater wells and few small vegetation (flowers and herbs) The islands were classified as International Bird Area by the Life Bird International; since they constitute a refuge for seabirds and landing station for migratory birds. There is a nesting community for several seabirds from genus Larus. West and SW coasts are of rocky eroded feature and exposed to the strong wind and heavy waves, Intertidal and infralittoral zones are covered with dense and diversified algae meadows. The East and NE sandy beach are formed at 90% with shells wrecks and organic particles. Temperature of seawater ranges between 16°C in February and 30°C in August. Flora which is highly diversified includes all species of microalgae and macroalgae Fauna, although poor in standing crop, shows a high taxonomic diversity; all groups and species of Zooplankton, Nekton, Fishes, Micro and Macrozoobenthos inhabiting the Levantine Basin are found in this area. Palm Islands which are considered as a National Protected Area is a nice place for ecotourism and a natural laboratory for education, scientific research and recreation. Fishing and wild picnics are strictly forbidden and visits are organized and managed by Ministries of Environment and Tourism.

AB  - Soil bioengineering is an appropriate approach to deal with erosion problems and shallow seated landslides especially in developing countries such as Nepal. This technique is a cost-effective solution using locally available materials and low-cost labour. Furthermore, this approach allows the involvement of the local population in the management and maintenance aspects. As an example for prevention of soil erosion and increased slope stability by means of vegetation, a landslide in the Middle Mountains of Nepal was selected for an innovative approach of rescheduling the implementation of soil bioengineering stabilisation works into the dry, winter season, testing plants for their suitability and using cut bamboo (Bambusa nutans G. C. Wall.) for the construction of vegetated crib walls. This paper deals with investigation, design, construction and monitoring over a period of 32 months. Soil bioengineering solutions for erosion control and shallow slope instabilities in the Middle Mountains proved to be highly successful and all plants, in particular Salix tetrasperma Roxb. and Alnus nepalensis Don., seemed to be suitable for winter plantation.

AB  - Since 1982, large-scale coastal protection works have taken place on the Danish North Sea coast. The subject of the first part of this paper is the coastal protection policy, the engineering approaches to erosion and flood control and the results achieved. An important tool for coastal protection has always been and still is nourishment. In the second part of the paper, the effect of the nourishment will be evaluated with focus on the positioning of the nourishment in the profile and on the use of coarse materials.

AB  - Hervey Bay City Council is a medium sized local government authority with management responsibility for over 60km of coastline. At a small coastal village to the north of the main urban area in Hervey Bay, Australia, persistent coastal erosion and poor planning decisions over the past 50 years has left private property at immediate risk of loss. Hervey Bay City Council identified the need to undertake coastal protection works at this location, and initiated a project to better understand the physical processes shaping the coastline, and to prepare various options to address the conflict between the eroding beach and the developed shoreline. This paper examines the challenges faced by local government in selecting and implementing shoreline protection strategies in Queensland, whilst attempting to manage the diverse pressures from the community, Elected Officials and State Government Agencies. It recommends improved integration and consultation between State Government Agencies, and with Local Government to ensure improved delivery and streamlined timelines for coastal protection works for Local Government.

AB  - Coastal zones are productive areas that serve as nursery grounds for a large number of marine species. However, the processes involved in survival success during the juvenile phase are not well-known. Some authors suggest that the availability of prey is important to support the production of pre-recruit fish whose fitness is enhanced through optimal feeding conditions. Accordingly, recruitment is limited by the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. In contrast, other authors state that the carrying capacity of the nursery grounds is not fully exploited, suggesting that there is no effect of food limitation. This study combines an overview of the literature, focused on flatfish that are especially dependent on coastal and estuarine nursery grounds, an extension to other marine fishes and a modelling approach on growth and survival of juvenile fish to explore the controversy of food limitation in their nursery grounds. We demonstrate that the relative lack of growth limitation observed for young marine fishes at the individual scale is related to an observational bias: fish have been affected by size-selective mortality linked to food limitation, but only surviving individuals are observed. As the population is skewed towards the faster-growing juveniles, the growth of survivors remains close to optimal, even when food resources are limited. Food limitation is of major influence in determining the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. To sustain marine fish populations and related fisheries, management action is needed to protect coastal and estuarine areas and maintain or restore nursery productivity.

AB  - The Mekong River delta plays an important role in the Vietnamese economy and it has been severely impacted during this century by a series of unusually large floods. In the dry season the delta is also impacted by salinity intrusion and tides. These effects have caused severe human hardship. To mitigate these impacts, a large number of engineering structures, primarily dykes and weirs, have been built in the delta in recent years and are still being built, mainly to control floods and saltwater intrusion. These control measures are still being upgraded. A GIS-linked numerical model shows that the flood levels in the delta depend on the combined impacts of high river flows in the Mekong River, storm surges, sea level rise, and the likely, future siltation of the Mekong Estuary resulting from the construction of dams in China as well as many other dams proposed throughout the remaining river catchment. The model suggests that the engineering structures in the delta increase the flow velocities in the rivers and canals, increasing bank erosion, and cause the water to be deeper in the rivers and canals. This increases flooding in the non-protected areas of the delta and increases the risk of catastrophic failure of the dykes in the protected areas. The model also predicts that a sea level rise induced by global warming will enhance flooding in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, and that flooding may worsen in the long term as a result of estuarine siltation resulting from the construction of dams. At the scale of the Mekong River basin, a multinational water resources management plan is needed that includes the hydrological needs of the delta. At the scale of the delta, a compromise is needed between allowing some flooding necessary for agriculture and preventing catastrophic flooding to alleviate human suffering.

AB  - The State of Louisiana (LA) Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) conducts extensive analytical modeling and project evaluations across an expansive coastal region along the Gulf of Mexico as part of updates to the State’s Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast (also known as Coastal Master Plan; CMP) on 5-year recurring intervals. The 2017 CMP includes a combination of 45 risk reduction and 79 coastal restoration projects with projected construction and implementation over a 50-year period through 2065 at a projected cost of $50 billion dollars. Risk reduction includes 13 structural and 32 non-structural projects. Structural risk reduction projects consist of continuation of new construction and maintenance of an extensive system of earthen levees, flood walls, flood gates, and pump stations. Non-structural projects consist of a combination of acquisition, elevating, and flood-proofing of residential and commercial structures within projected coastal storm flood risk areas. The Lake Pontchartrain Barrier structural risk reduction project has projected one of the highest cost-effectiveness (CE) values of all CMP projects. This paper will focus on hydrodynamic and risk reduction modeling performed to evaluate a series of conceptual design alternatives for the Lake Pontchartrain Barrier (LPB). © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - Managed realignment - the deliberate process of realigning river, estuary or coastal defences - is increasingly seen as a key element to sustainable long term flood and coastal management in the UK and other parts of the world, given current trends of sea level rise, and increasing costs of flood and coastal defence. This paper presents results of an extensive consultation of key stakeholders in England and Wales on what they consider to be the main drivers of and obstacles to managed realignment. It reveals why managed realignment has not taken place on a larger scale so far, and suggests new directions for a long term strategic approach to river and coastal flood management.

AB  - The availability and plant uptake of heavy metals was evaluated from contaminated dredged material placed in flooded and upland disposal environments using a solid-phase plant bioassay. The study was to verify previous research and to develop a plant bioassay procedure that could indicate phytotoxicity and bio-accumulation of heavy metals in contaminated dredged material. Placing the contaminated dredged material in a flooded (reduced) environment lowered the availability and plant uptake of cadmium and to a lesser extent zinc. Factors that influenced the availability and plant uptake of heavy metals included sediment oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter content, total sulfur content, and pH. The plant bioassay showed phytotoxicity and bioaccumulation of arsenic under a flooded environment. Placing the arsenic-contaminated sediment in a upland environment reduced both the phytotoxicity and bioaccumulation of arsenic in the freshwater marsh plant Cyperus esculentus. (A)

AB  - The extreme sea level due to storm surge and future sea-level rise (SLR) in the year of 2050 and 2100 are estimated by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extreme value analysis (EVA) with long-term sea level records in and around the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, an adaptive data analysis method, can separate the tidal motions and the non-linear trend from the sea level records to reconstruct the storm surge levels, and then the reconstructed storm surge levels are applied to statistical model, EVA, to obtain the extreme storm surges at 95% confidence interval in the target return periods. The SLR trend at Tokuyama in the Seto Inland Sea obtained from EEMD is 3.58 mm/yr over 1993-2010, which is slightly larger than the recent altimetry-based global rate of 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr over 1993-2007. The resulting SLR in 2050 and 2100 estimated are 0.18 m and 0.49 m, respectively. The 30-, 50-, and 100-yr return levels at Tokuyama obtained by EVA are 1.30 m, 1.43 m and 1.64 m. Therefore, the extreme sea level in 2050 and 2100 due to future SLR and storm surge with 100-yr return level would be 1.82 m (1.35 m ~ 2.26 m with 95% confidence intervals) and 2.13 m (1.75 m ~ 3.10 m with 95% confidence intervals), respectively. The SLR is not only due to mass and volume changes of sea water, but also due to other factors such as local subsidence, river discharge and sediments, and vegetation effect. The non-linear trend of SLR, which is the residue from EEMD, can be regarded as a final consequential sea level after considering those factors and their nonlinearity. The combined EEMD-EVA method can be useful tool not only for the extreme sea level estimation under climate change, but also for many cases in coastal engineering and hydrology.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2013 Conference Start Date: 2013, Sept. 23 Conference End Date: 2013, Sept. 27 Conference Location: San Diego, CA, USA In order to protect coastal facilities mainly from wave and current actions, the self-locking eco blocks constituting elements of protecting shore structures against scouring were designed. These blocks are adapted to the sloping bottom, coastal dunes, and submerged coastal pipelines, counteracting the destructive and erosive impulse action. A series of laboratory experiments has been conducted to investigate the reflection of water waves over and against a train of protruded or submerged shore structures and compare the reflecting capabilities of incident waves including wave forces. In this study the hydraulic model experiment was conducted to identify the performance of newly designed water affinity eco blocks to keep the coast slope and bottom mound from scouring by reduction of the wave reflection and to convince stability of the block placement. Revised design of each block element was also tested for field conditions. From the result of experiments, the field applicability of the developed blocks and placement was discussed afterward.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most sensitive of habitats to oil spills. A field experiment was conducted on a salt marsh in Atlantic Canada to determine the significance of bioremediation by nutrient enrichment in enhancing wetland restoration. Six experimental treatments were monitored: (1) unoiled control (2) unoiled control + nutrients, (3) oil with no treatment (natural attenuation), (4) oil + nutrients, (5) oil + nutrients with plants cut back, (6) oil + nutrients with disking (tilling) to enrich oxygen penetration. Remediation success was quantified by determining changes in the composition and concentration of the residual oil, plant recovery and reduction in sediment toxicity. The experimental results advocate natural attenuation as the clean-up strategy for the ecotype under study. Within the untreated plots, significant recovery of the predominant plant species within the marsh (Spartina alterniflora) was observed after 20 weeks and approximately 90% of the resolved n-alkanes and 70% of the parent and alkyl-substituted poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were biodegraded.

AB  - Biological processes and physical characteristics associated with seagrass can greatly affect acoustic propagation in coastal regions. An important acoustical effect is due to bubble production by the plants, which can have significant impact on both object detection and bottom mapping sonars by increasing clutter through reflection, absorption, and scattering of sound. In addition to photosynthesis bubbles and gas-bearing leaf tissue in the water column, the plant rhizomes also contain aerenchyma (gas-filled channels), which allow for diffusion of oxygen into the surrounding sediment. To study these effects, in situ acoustic measurements were conducted in a bed of Thalassia testudium in east Corpus Christi Bay, TX. Direct measurements of sound speed and attenuation were obtained in the water column above the seagrass canopy, inside the seagrass canopy, and at discrete depths within the sediment. A complimentary set of measurements were obtained in a bare sediment region located a few meters away. In addition to standard measurements of geoacoustic properties (sediment density, grain size, etc.), biomass was also estimated from cores collected at each site. The sediment beneath the seagrass bed had significantly lower wave speed and higher attenuation compared to the bare sediment.

AB  - A monitoring programme has been established for the 351km of the UK Southern North Sea Coast (between the Humber and Thames estuaries). This has produced over 3300 beach profiles captured to a clear specification at 1km intervals in summer and winter since 1991. The analysis of this data has been previously linked to specific flood defence and coastal protection engineering schemes. The first analysis on a region wide basis has now been undertaken to provide some strategic insight into how the coast is evolving on an Integrated Scale. The analysis provides quantification of the change at the coast, and demonstrates that simple analytical tools combined with geomorphological interpretation can provide meaningful information for coastal management.

AB  - Oysters are ecosystem engineers that create biogenic reef habitat important to estuarine biodiversity, benthic-pelagic coupling, and fishery production. Prevailing explanations for the dramatic decline of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) during the last century overlook ecosystem complexity by ignoring interactions among multiple environmental disturbances. To explain oyster loss, we tested whether (1) mortality of oysters on natural oyster reefs varies with water depth (3 m rs. 6 m), (2) harvesting by oyster dredges reduces the height of oyster reefs, and (3) bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia and reduction in reef height through fishery disturbance interact to enhance mortality of oysters in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. The percentage of oysters found dead (mean ± 1 SD) during a survey of natural reefs in May 1993 was significantly greater at 6-m (92 ± 10%) than at 3-m (28 ± 9%) water depth. Less than one season's worth of oyster dredging reduced the height of restored oyster reefs by ~30%. During stratification of the water column in summer, oxygen depletion near the seafloor at 6 m caused mass mortality of oysters, other invertebrates, and fishes on short, deep experimental reefs, while oysters and other reef associates elevated into the surface layer by sufficient reef height or by location in shallow water survived. Highly mobile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) abandoned burrows located in hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters but remained alive in shallow water. Our results indicate that interaction of reef habitat degradation (height reduction) through fishery disturbance and extended bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia caused the pattern of oyster mortality observed on natural reefs and influences the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrate species that utilize this temperate reef habitat. Interactions among environmental disturbances imply a need for the integrative approaches of ecosystem management to restore and sustain estuarine habitat.

AB  - A comprehensive investigation of Canadian boreal forest fires was conducted using NOAA-AVHRR. Algorithms were developed for detecting active fires (hotspots), burned areas, and smoke plumes, which employ single images and 10-day Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. The hotspot algorithm was applied to four years (1994-97) of imagery, producing a daily fire mask for Canada. Almost all fire events were detected, but cumulative hotspot area was significantly smaller (approx. 30%) than burned area reported by fire agencies. To provide more accurate estimates of burned area, a burn mapping algorithm was developed that synergistically combines the hotspot product with anniversary data NDVI composites. The hybrid technique produced estimates of Canada-wide burned area that were within 5 percent of official statistics. A neural-network classifier was also developed that allows smoke plumes to be effectively separated from cloud cover at a regional scale.

AB  - Vegetation and soil properties were described across a well-dated sand-dune chronosequence bordering northern Lake Michigan to document patterns and rates of primary succession and forest ecosystem development, and to determine environmental constraints that potentially drive succession and regulate species diversity. The site experienced frequent and continuing formation of 72 shore-parallel dune ridges over the past 2375 yr. Across the chronosequence represented by the youngest 13 dune ridges aged 25-440 yr, there were clear patterns of species turnover and community convergence as well as successional changes in species diversity, aboveground biomass, aboveground litter production, net ecosystem production, nutrient pools, and nutrient cycling. Dune-building species were replaced by evergreen shrubs and bunchgrass within 100 yr, which in turn, were replaced by mixed pine forest within 345 yr. Plant-species richness increased to a peak in developing forest at 285 yr but thereafter decreased as early-successional species disappeared from the communities. Rates of species addition peaked between 95 and 145 yr as forest species invaded, whereas rates of species loss peaked between 345 and 440 yr as early-successional species were lost from the developing forest. Development of the forest ecosystem required ~300 yr (i.e., 145-440 years). Total ecosystem carbon increased in a logistic manner to 128 Mg C/ha, with net ecosystem production peaking at 30 g C·m-2·yr-1 in developing forest. Aboveground biomass and O horizon mass increased to ~137 Mg/ha and ~79 Mg/ha, respectively, whereas aboveground litter production increased to 3.5 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 at 440 yr, but thereafter varied between 175 and 350 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. Total carbon and total nitrogen in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil and O horizon accumulated to ~42 Mg/ha and ~1.36 Mg/ha, respectively. Estimated average rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation over 440 yr of ecosystem aggradation were 23.2 g·m-2·yr-1 for carbon and 0.38 g·m-2·yr-1 for nitrogen. Because nitrogen-fixing plants are rare on the upland dune ridges, ecosystem aggradation depends largely on atmospheric nitrogen inputs. Following colonization by conifers, soil acidification resulted in rapid leaching losses of calcium and magnesium, whereas phosphorus and potassium were cycled more tightly. The dune chronosequence represents a complex gradient of changing environmental constraints that differentially reduce the survival, growth, and reproduction of plant species. Young dune ridges near the lake shore are characterized by strong winds, sand burial and erosion, high insolation, high rates of evaporation, and low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. These conditions ameliorate with increasing dune age as wind velocities and sand movement diminish with distance from the lake, as accumulating organic matter improves the moisture-holding capacity and nitrogen availability of the soil, and as mineral weathering mobilizes soil phosphorus. However, in developing forest, light and cationic nutrients may become limiting, and decreased light availability, cool soil temperatures, and accumulation of a thick forest floor may limit recruitment from seed for many species. These numerous potential environmental constraints suggest a considerable complexity in this ostensibly simple ecosystem.

AB  - <jats:p>Close to ninety percent of Guyana‟s population live along a low lying coastal plain, which is below sea level and very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While the national government has not yet developed a comprehensive climate policy, the potential impacts of climate change is considered in several sectoral policies, much of which emphasize mitigation, with little focus on adaptation. This research examined the current priorities for adaptation by a review of the policies within the natural resource sector to identify opportunities for adaptation, especially ecosystem based adaptation. A Diagnostic Adaptation Framework (DAF) was used to help identify approaches to address a given adaptation challenge with regards to needs, measures and options. A survey questionnaire was used to support the policy reviews and identified four key vulnerabilities: coastal floods; sea level rise; drought and extreme weather events. The application of the DAF in selecting an adaptation method suggests the need for more data on drought and extreme weather events. Coastal flooding is addressed, with recognized need for more data and public awareness for ecosystem based adaptation</jats:p>

AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted.) In 1993 and 1998, at the beginning and toward the end of Zhu Rongji's tenure as China's economic czar, plummeting global crude oil prices precipitated macroeconomic crises and eroded the profitability of domestic oil companies. Each crisis exposed the high opportunity costs of supporting state-owned enterprises (SOEs); yet the central government's responses differed dramatically in each case. In 1993, Zhu Rongji relaxed the ministerial division of labor and devolved strategic and financial decisions to individual SOEs. He also leaned on two powerful levers of the planned economy-central government pricing and tax authority-to balance the conflicting interests of the oil and petrochemical producers. In doing so, he deferred an opportunity for substantial restructuring. In 1998, Zhu Rongji went in the opposite direction. He pushed for the recentralization of control over state assets through Western forms of corporate organization and the consolidation of SOEs' share of the national market, coupled with significant liberalization of the pricing and trade regimes. The combined effect was the decisive dismantling of the "Plan" as the dominant means of governing the oil and petrochemical industries. What were the political and economic factors leading to these divergent responses? As a top global oil producer, China was remarkably insulated from transnational oil politics in the first decade and a half of post-Mao reform. With the country largely self-sufficient in domestic supply and demand up to 1993, the State Council kept the oil industry wholly nationally owned and subservient to the broader rapid developmental goals of the post-Mao era.1 Yet, even in autarkic (not reliant on imports) or highly protected sectors operating under regulated prices, global price shocks create pressures on domestic interests that feel acutely the opportunity costs of economic closure.2 I argue that the differences in outcomes in these two episodes stemmed from the intervening impacts of the general macroeconomic and industry-specific aggregate supply and demand imbalances. These "disequilibria" altered the relative interests and capabilities of Chinese central bureaucrats, local states and industrial entities to adjust to global price shocks within the decentralized framework. In particular, two major disequilibria cleared the way politically for radical enterprise reform in the late 1990s. The first came in 1996, when the Chinese economy crossed a critical threshold of economic transition-from a postsocialist shortage economy into a surplus economy marked by overcapacity in industrial production and by deflationary pressures. This macroeconomic disequilibrium knocked the political wind out of the early beneficiaries of decentralization, as failing firms and fiscally endangered local states were unable to adjust to price shocks. In contrast, in 1993 these interests had been capturing rent from the post-1992 economic boom, and hastened to marshal financial and political resources to resist Zhu Rongji's efforts to take back central control. The second disequilibrium came in 1997 as depressed global crude prices and a flood of cheap imports from Southeast Asian producers hit by the Asian Financial Crisis led to widespread failures of both the upstream and downstream interests-the oilfields and the refineries. This was not the case in the early 1990s, when the downstream interests consistently benefited from domestic price controls at the expense of the upstream. As a result, the persistent conflict of interest between the oil and petrochemical industry dissolved temporarily, creating a window of opportunity to change the pricing mechanism fundamentally. In short, by 1998 the broad coalition of local governments, enterprise managers and central ministerial interests in support of the decentralized framework of reform had neither the interest nor the resources to continue defending the status quo. …

AB  - Coastal dunes represent a natural barrier and play a vital role in the coastal defense against the waves and tides. Dune enhancement or reconstruction is considered to be a solution to avoid the negative effects on the ecological and aesthetic values of the coast by those engineering structures. Two field experiments were conducted for dune building at the Tainan coast in Taiwan. Experimental sets, including artificial vegetation, sand fence deployment and the bulldozed dunes with different surface pavements, were set up to re-build the foredune that have been previously damaged. A small natural remnant dune was chosen as the comparison set for evaluating the effectiveness of the sand accumulation and vegetation growth. The dune reconstruction processes were observed by monitoring the changes of dune profiles, surface sand grain size, and the vegetation density. The experiment results are used to suggest an appropriate dune rehabilitation procedure for this area. The results reveal that a bulldozed dune can raise the height immediately, and putting oyster racks on the bare surface can help the accumulation of sand and the colonization of vegetation that will quickly stabilize the artificial foredune. Sand surface covered with oyster shells may avoid wind erosion at the beginning, but it also hampered the vegetation colonization. Muddy sand surface formed a hard crust to reduce the wind erosion, but it also hindered the infiltration process that two gullies were found on the dune after a heavy rain. Sand fence should have an appropriate fence porosity to be effective. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - <jats:p>In recent years, lake eutrophication caused a large of Cyanobacteria bloom which not only brought serious ecological disaster but also restricted the sustainable development of regional economy in our country. <i>Chlorophyll-a</i> is a very important environmental factor to monitor water quality, especially for lake eutrophication. Remote sensed technique has been widely utilized in estimating the concentration of <i>chlorophyll-a</i> by different kind of vegetation indices and monitoring its distribution in lakes, rivers or along coastline. For each vegetation index, its quantitative estimation accuracy for different satellite data might change since there might be a discrepancy of spectral resolution and channel center between different satellites. The purpose this paper is to analyze the spectral feature of <i>chlorophyll-a</i> with hyperspectral data (totally 651 bands) and use the result to choose the optimal band combination for different satellites. The analysis method developed here in this study could be useful to recognize and monitor cyanobacteria bloom automatically and accrately. <br><br> In our experiment, the reflectance (from 350nm to 1000nm) of wild cyanobacteria in different consistency (from 0 to 1362.11ug/L) and the corresponding <i>chlorophyll-a</i> concentration were measured simultaneously. Two kinds of hyperspectral vegetation indices were applied in this study: simple ratio (SR) and narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), both of which consists of any two bands in the entire 651 narrow bands. Then multivariate statistical analysis was used to construct the linear, power and exponential models. After analyzing the correlation between <i>chlorophyll-a</i> and single band reflectance, SR, NDVI respetively, the optimal spectral index for quantitative estimation of cyanobacteria <i>chlorophyll-a</i>, as well corresponding central wavelength and band width were extracted. Results show that: Under the condition of water disturbance, SR and NDVI are both suitable for quantitative estimation of <i>chlorophyll-a</i>, and more effective than the traditional single band model; the best regression models for SR, NDVI with <i>chlorophyll-a</i> are linear and power, respectively. Under the condition without water disturbance, the single band model works the best. For the SR index, there are two optimal band combinations, which is comprised of infrared (700nm-900nm) and blue-green range (450nm-550nm), infrared and red range (600nm-650nm) respectively, with band width between 45nm to 125nm. For NDVI, the optimal band combination includes the range from 750nm to 900nm and 700nm to 750nm, with band width less than 30nm. For single band model, band center located between 733nm-935nm, and its width mustn’t exceed the interval where band center located in. <br><br> This study proved , as for SR or NDVI, the centers and widths are crucial factors for quantitative estimating <i>chlorophyll-a</i>. As for remote sensor, proper spectrum channel could not only improve the accuracy of recognizing cyanobacteria bloom, but reduce the redundancy of hyperspectral data. Those results will provide better reference for designing the suitable spectrum channel of customized sensors for cyanobacteria bloom monitoring at a low altitude. In other words, this study is also the basic research for developing the real-time remote sensing monitoring system with high time and high spatial resolution.</jats:p>

AB  - The objective of this contribution is to describe the methodology and key results of an assessment of the impacts of extreme wave events on Basque coast (Gipuzkoan coast) via flood risk maps. The risk of marine flooding during extreme events has been calculated along the coast, by combining the action from high sea level and waves and using numerical modeling. The extreme wave flood level was integrated with a high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (using airborne topographic LiDAR) to produce flood-risk maps. The impacts on land use and biological communities have also been assessed by overlaying the flood-risk maps with detailed coastal habitat classification. The results were compared to the impact expected from sea level rise by the end of the 21st century. The extreme wave flood risk map suggests that 164 ha of the supralittoral zone of the Gipuzkoan coast will be affected. This area consists mainly in sandy beaches, harbours and urban areas exposed to high wave energy (NW orientation). In contrast the areas expected to be impacted by sea level rise, are concentrated in protected low-lying areas especially within the inner estuaries (with terrestrial and artificial habitats being the most affected) and extend over 111 ha.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to assess the effectiveness of a new Type III chemical dispersant on stranded, lightly weathered crude oil and emulsified medium fuel oil (mousse). The oils were applied to field plots on contrasting sediment shorelines (salt marsh and sand flat), where both oils had been shown to be persistent. On the salt marsh, dispersant-treated oils usually were detected at lower sediment total hydrocarbon (THC) concentrations than were the untreated oils. However, clear trends were not visible until heavy rain removed the oiled, dead vegetation. Subsequently, the THC concentrations measured in the treated crude plots were reduced by half, and stable, lower concentrations were measured in the mousse plots. On the sand flat, the dispersant-treated mousse was detected at consistently lower THC concentrations than was the untreated mousse. The crude-oil-treated plots showed more temporal variability than the mousse-treated plots. Dispersant-treated crude ultimately was detected at half the concentration found in the untreated crude plots. Although on the salt marsh both dispersant-treated oils were more damaging in the short term to the plant community, the longer-term effects of higher untreated oil concentrations may prove more de-stabilizing to the salt-marsh habitat as a whole. After erosion, untreated oil may be resuspended to form oil slicks, when public interest in the original spill and the sense of responsibility for its cleanup have all but disappeared. Under the slightly higher-energy conditions of the sand flat, dispersant use did not dramatically alter the fate of most of the oil. The approximately 10% that remained in the beach was less obvious visually and was removed faster than the untreated oil. The practical implication of this is that if the cleanup authorities can resist amenity and conservationist pressures to disperse the residual oil, such tidal flats will eventually self-clean. Earlier formulations of chemical dispersant either have been relatively ineffective or have increased contamination on low-energy sediment shores. Several explanations may be advanced for the effectiveness of this dispersant on both oil types. First, it helped prevent the formation of surface oiled pavements and, thus, the burial of oil layers. Second, the contact time of oils and dispersant (>2 hours pre-tidal coverage) may have contributed to the reductions in oil concentrations. Third, at both sites there was sufficient energy input to assist dispersion.

AB  - HHHHHHHHHHHHH Lock, M.C, van der Geest, H.G. and Lazonder, C, 2009. Early colonization of algal communities on polyurethane bonded aggregate: a field and laboratory study. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 56 (Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium), 438 442. Lisbon, Portugal, ISSN 0749-0258 More and more coastlines are changing into urban structures. This change is marked by the application of a wide variety of different materials as revetments, often creating a hard substrate. The realization of such substrates can have large consequences for the flora and fauna inhabiting the coastal areas. Elastocoast? is such a new coastal protection material, made from rocks and polyurethane. It is a hard substrate but with an open structure and a smooth surface. This study examines the first phase of the recovery and growth of the algal community during the storm season of 2007-2008 on a dike in the Netherlands that was refurbished with Elastocoast?, and it describes a short term algal colonization experiment in the laboratory. In the field, 25 weeks after the construction of the Elastocoast? top layer, dike vegetation has returned, though strongly zonated and leaving large patches without any vegetation. Main algal species are Enteromorpha minima and Fucus spiralis. It is expected that the algal community will fully resemble typical hard substrate communities (as e.g. growing on basalt) when given enough time. The laboratory experiment showed that colonization by micro-algae is not hindered by the smooth surface and can be fast and substantial under favorable circumstances. Elastocoast? therefore seems to be a material which allows algal community recovery to be fast and according to the typical vegetation growing on hard substrates. aditional index words: Early colonization, Dike vegetation, Fucus canopy, Micro-algae

AB  - Marine biological invasions have been regarded as one of the major causes of native biodiversity loss, with shipping and aquaculture being the leading contributors for the introductions of alien species in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, five aquatic alien species (one mollusk, three crustaceans and one fish species) were detected during dives, shore searches and from the fisheries on the coast of the Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area, in the States of Piauí and Maranhão, Northeastern Brazil. The species were the bicolor purse-oyster Isognomon bicolor, the whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the Indo-Pacific swimming crab Charybdis hellerii and, the muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus. Ballast water (I. bicolor, C. hellerii, and O. punctatus) and aquaculture activities (L. vannamei and M. rosenbergii) in adjacent areas are the most likely vectors of introduction. All exotic species found have potential impact risks to the environment because they are able to compete against native species for resources (food and habitat). Isognomon bicolor share the same habitat and food items with the native bivalve species of mussels and barnacles. Litopenaeus vannamei share the same habitat and food items with the native penaeids such as the pinkspot shrimp Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis, the Southern brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus subtilis, and the Southern white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti, and in the past few years L. vannamei was responsible for a viral epidemics in the cultivation tanks that could be transmitted to native penaeid shrimps. Charybdis hellerii is also able to cause impacts on the local fisheries as the species can decrease the populations of native portunid crabs which are commercialized in the studied region. Macrobrachium rosenbergii may be sharing natural resources with the Amazon River prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum. Omobranchus punctatus shares habit with the native redlip blenny Ophioblennius atlanticus and other fishes, such as the frillfin goby Bathigobius soporator Some immediate remedial measures to prevent further introductions from ballast water and shrimp farm ponds should be: (i) to prevent the release of ballast water by ship/vessels in the region; (ii) to reroute all effluent waters from shrimp rearing facilities through an underground or above-ground dry well; (iii) to install adequate sand and gravel filter which will allow passage of water but not livestock; (iv) outdoor shrimp pounds located on floodable land should be diked, and; (v) to promote environmental awareness of those directly involved with ballast water (crews of ship/vessels) and shrimp farms in the region.

AB  - Soluble organic matter derived from exotic Pinus species has been shown to form stronger complexes with iron (Fe) than that derived from most native Australian species. It has also been proposed that the establishment of exotic Pinus plantations in coastal southeast Queensland may have enhanced the solubility of Fe in soils by increasing the amount of organically complexed Fe, but this remains inconclusive. In this study we test whether the concentration and speciation of Fe in soil water from Pinus plantations differs significantly from soil water from native vegetation areas. Both Fe redox speciation and the interaction between Fe and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were considered; Fe - DOM interaction was assessed using the Stockholm Humic Model. Iron concentrations (mainly Fe 2+) were greatest in the soil waters with the greatest DOM content collected from sandy podosols (Podzols), where they are largely controlled by redox potential. Iron concentrations were small in soil waters from clay and iron oxide-rich soils, in spite of similar redox potentials. This condition is related to stronger sorption on to the reactive clay and iron oxide mineral surfaces in these soils, which reduces the amount of DOM available for electron shuttling and microbial metabolism, restricting reductive dissolution of Fe. Vegetation type had no significant influence on the concentration and speciation of iron in soil waters, although DOM from Pinus sites had greater acidic functional group site densities than DOM from native vegetation sites. This is because Fe is mainly in the ferrous form, even in samples from the relatively well-drained podosols. However, modelling suggests that Pinus DOM can significantly increase the amount of truly dissolved ferric iron remaining in solution in oxic conditions. Therefore, the input of ferrous iron together with Pinus DOM to surface waters may reduce precipitation of hydrous ferric oxides (ferrihydrite) and increase the flux of dissolved Fe out of the catchment. Such inputs of iron are most probably derived from podosols planted with Pinus.

AB  - A release of approximately 6,561 barrels of crude oil from a Texaco pipeline into Lake Barre in May 1997 injured marsh, birds, and aquatic fauna. Texaco was proactive in dealing with the trustees in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) process and stayed directly involved throughout; resulting in a cooperative assessment. The trustees focused quickly on the key injuries that required assessment. There was early agreement to conduct a cooperative, restoration-based NRDA, and to design field studies for the injured marsh to provide inputs for scaling using habitat equivalency analysis (HEA). It also was agreed that for this incident, field studies to assess bird and aquatic faunal injury would not be cost-effective or likely improve the accuracy of injury estimates. Although agreement on a common quantification approach for faunal injury was not reached, the two sides agreed on how much restoration was appropriate. The parties developed an extensive list of restoration alternatives, and although the trustees retained the final decision making authority, there were no significant disagreements on how various alternatives ranked according to restoration selection criteria. The selected project is planting saltmarsh vegetation on a platform of dredged material placed on East Timbalier Island by the Coastal Wetland Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) program. No CWPPRA funds were available for planting. In scaling the restoration, Texaco will only get credit for the ecological services provided by their planting above that which would occur in the absence of planting. Factors such as erosion rates expected with and without planting and the rate of natural colonization of marsh in the absence of planting were considered in the scaling calculations. The trustees and Texaco jointly briefed attorneys for both sides throughout the NRDA process, but were not active participants in meetings regarding technical matters. These briefings ensured a quick transition from the injury assessment and restoration project selection process to settlement negotiations. A consent decree was lodged with the court in September 1999. Texaco will implement the restoration and the monitoring plan, and pay all trustee assessment and restoration oversight costs as part of the settlement.

AB  - Three beach and spit systems have been studied in northern Galicia, along the northwest coast of Spain, within the regional context of sea level rise and coastal erosion. Each system forms part of an estuary's mouth complex within the inner part of the Ortigueira, Barqueiro, and Viveiro rias. Erosive processes along the coast have been characterised and been found to affect cliffs, beaches, and archaeological sites. To compare both long-term (decadal) and short-term (annual) erosion and accretion trends among estuaries, we analysed the morphodynamic characteristics, the degree of human occupancy, and the historical evolution of each system and monitored two profiles at each beach. Dynamic parameters—dimensionless fall velocity and relative tidal range—were calculated for the characterisation of beaches, and maritime climate data—significant wave height (Hs), peak period (Tp), wave fetch direction, and wave period were obtained, and wave height reduction was estimated for all estuaries.

AB  - Abstract. Mangroves have long been known as the important ecosystem for being home to aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, as well as fisheries resources. It is also considered an efficient carbon pool in tropical regions such as Indonesia. However, recent developments in the coastal areas of Bengkulu City in Indonesia could potentially alter and erode mangrove functions, in particular, mangroves as a carbon sink. Previous studies on the role of mangrove forests concerning global warming in the area have not illustrated the distribution of biomass and carbon and its uncertainties. Hence, this study aimed to assess mangrove richness, biomass and carbon content to provide the current state and distribution and its role in climate change mitigation. Six sampling locations were determined reflecting area distribution and its status (conservation and non-conservation). A total of 60 nested quadrat plots were employed for the trees and saplings category. Above- and below-ground biomass was estimated by using the allometric model. The findings showed that a total of nine species were observed. The average biomass and carbon stocks were 302.27 t ha-1 and 135.02 t C ha-1, respectively, over seven-fold higher than the previous studies. Pantai Panjang station was the highest storing carbon at 235.95 t C ha-1, while the lowest was in Teluk Sepang (74.61 t C ha-1). These findings also suggest that non-protected mangrove forests also played a key role, similar to the conservation mangrove forests, regarding the climate change mitigation. It is, therefore, urgently required to enhance the strategy and program in order to maintain the current mangrove ecosystems within and beyond the conservation areas.

AB  - Extensive pore water data has been gathered in the Great Marsh, Delaware over various seasons, salinities, and tides. The data all point to a complimentary redox cycle for sulfur and iron which operates seasonally and tidally. Surface oxidizing conditions prevail in summer, with more reducing conditions at depth during the winter. During the spring tides which flood the marsh, pyrite oxidation occurs releasing excess dissolved iron and sulfate to the porewaters, and precipitating authigenic solid iron phases. The redox conditions in the porewaters of the upper zone during the summer is poised between mildly oxidizing and mildly reducing conditions as shown by pE calculations. This redox environment and intermediate iron-sulfur redox species may be important for the stimulation of plant growth and sustenance of a viable microbial community.

AB  - To characterize the distribution of nitrogen in the sediment of Taige south river estuary, column samples of sediments were collected and analyzed in April, 2012. Our results revealed that a synchronized trend existed among the levels of ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+) -N), organic nitrogen (Org-N) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface layer of sediment. The NH4(+) -N positively correlated with TN and Org-N significantly (P < 0.05) while TN highly significantly correlated with Org-N (P < 0.01). Org-N was the major form of nitrogen, comprising 93.38% of total nitrogen (TN) averagely. Both horizontal and vertical distribution of nitrogen in sediments apparently changed along the distance to stream outlet. In the horizontal dimension in sediments, Org-N and TN decreased progressively as forwarding into the lake in the extending direction of the main stream, while showed a "W"-type fluctuation in the diverged direction away from the main stream. The level of NH4(+) -N decreased rapidly within 100 m to the stream outlet and remained constantly at a lower level beyond 100 m. However, the level of nitrate nitrogen (NO3(-) -N) stabilized within 0-800 m and increased greatly beyond 800 m. In the vertical dimension in sediments, the level of NH4(+) -N increased with increasing depth. As the distance to the stream outlet increasing, the enrichment of NO3(-) -N was enhanced in surface layers rather than in lower subsurface layers. Alternatively, the enrichment of Org-N and TN were reduced in surface layers but enhanced in subsurface layers.

AB  - The impact of runoff from sulfuric soils in the heavily drained Cudgen Lake floodplain, eastern Australia on water quality and downstream coastal lake sediments has been examined. The oxidation of sulfidic soils and the transformation into sulfuric soils leads to changes not only in the upper soil profile but also affects drainage water quality and the chemistry of bottom sediments in receiving waters. Oxidation transforms the soil from a sink for sulfur and metals to a significant source for downstream environments. Sulfuric soils within the Cudgen Lake catchment contain 9.18x10 super(5) mol H super(+) per hectare as well as elevated concentration of metals (e.g. Al, Fe, Mn) and sulfate. These products of sulfidic soil oxidation are transported efficiently from the soil profile by the constructed drainage network and into the downstream lake system. The acid volatile sulfur (AVS), chromium reducible sulfur (CRS), total sulfur, organic carbon, and reactive iron contents present in the solid phase of the lake sediments are reported. The AVS/CRS, DOP and dos values observed in the lake sediments show that natural monosulfide formation in the near surface sediments has been enhanced due to increased inputs of organic matter, sulfate, ferrous iron and other metals following development of the catchment. There are elevated concentrations of metals (e.g. As, Al, Cd, Cr, Hg, Zn and Pb) in the upper layer of monsulfidic lake sediments compared with the underlying pyritic sediments some of which exceed sediment quality guidelines. These metals could be released by dredging or through re-suspension during high flow conditions or enter the food chain.

AB  - Baird harnessed the latest technology to improve the beach while minimizing environmental impacts and improving habitat wherever possible at a west coast location in Barbados. Baird used an Echoscope to precisely map bathymetry, living reef, and voids in relic reef. Following numerical and physical modeling, underwater structures for beach stabilization were specifically designed to accommodate coral transplants and lab grown corals. This first phase of shoreline stabilization creates new opportunities for enhancement, training, and education. Subsequent monitoring of biodiversity will measure the rate of reef recovery. Turbidity monitoring, as well as rainfall and surface run-off rates, will provide much needed information regarding the relative impacts of wave sediment resuspension and surface run-off on coral health. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - <jats:p>High water levels on Lake Michigan during 1985 and 1986 created substantial erosion of the shoreline and reduced the size and recreational potential of many of the parks and beaches. To prevent further erosion, protect existing properties and structures, and to create and improve recreational areas along the Lake Michigan shoreline, four coastal engineering projects were designed and constructed during this time. Artificial beach units stabilized by offshore breakwaters were used as the main component of each project. Physical hydraulic model studies were used to determine the orientation, size, and spacing of breakwaters and artificial beach units. Model predictions of beach profiles and plan shapes compare closely with prototype surveys. Surveys completed since construction demonstrate the stability of the beaches and support their use as effective, low maintenance shoreline protection. Prototype experience has shown that these projects are extremely successful both in their ability to withstand storms on the Great Lakes and to attract people for recreational activities.</jats:p>

AB  - Nine study sites of the reef crest along the entire length of a 15 km-long bank-barrier reef off the southeast coast of Barbados indicated that the surface is composed of mostly reworked fragments of Acropora palmata covered with macroalgae, crustose coralline algae and turf algae. Known as Cobbler's Reef, this feature had no live colonies of A. palmata at our study sites and supported only small scattered colonies of corals, mainly Diploria spp., Porites astreoides and the hydrocoral Millepora complanata. Eleven of 29 surface-sample radiocarbon dates plot above the western Atlantic sea-level curve between approximately 3,300 to 4,500 cal yrs (calibrated, calendar super(14)C years) ago. This suggests that the reef complex was extensively damaged by a series of severe storms during this period. A reduced number of in situ framework dates follow that period and plot at acceptable depths of growth below this sea-level curve. The most recent dates are 320 and 400 cal yrs old. The lack of coral framework recovery and final demise of this reef are probably related to a number of disturbances. Although white-band disease, bleaching, and recruitment limitations could have played a role, a lack of herbivory in this area of constant heavy wave action probably allowed heavy algal growth that prevented the re-establishment of a vigorous coral reef following the period of severe storm activity. Finally, the turbidity associated with the clearing of land for sugarcane agriculture in the mid-1600s likely killed the last of the sediment-sensitive A. palmata on Cobbler's Reef. The more recent almost complete loss of A. palmata from other reefs off Barbados is probably related to storm damage and nutrient runoff and construction associated with tourism development. This is an expanded report of an earlier publication of this study, with descriptions of sampling sites and documentation of the demise of A. palmata island wide.

AB  - Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus) is an invasive aquatic plant introduced to North America from Eurasia in 1897. Flowering rush can grow either submersed or emergent from wet soil habitats to waters that are up to 5 m deep. Flowering rush was first observed in the Detroit Lakes system in the 1960s, causing significant impact to shoreline and recreational use. Flowering rush is currently found in five basins of the Detroit Lakes system: Big Detroit, Little Detroit, Curfman, Sallie, and Melissa Lakes. Submersed treatments with diquat were used during 2012 on an operational scale to control the nuisance impacts of flowering rush in waters from 0 to 1.3 m deep. We evaluated the response of native plant communities with the use of a point intercept method on 30 or more predetermined points in each of nine treatment plots, with four untreated reference plots. Treatment plots were sampled before treatment (June), and 4 wk after each of the two treatments. We also sampled 20 biomass cores (0.018 m super(-2)) in each of four treatment and four untreated reference plots. Although some species declined after treatment, most native species did not change significantly after treatments compared to untreated reference plots. Treatments with diquat not only significantly reduce flowering rush distribution (60%) and aboveground bio- mass (99%), but also significantly reduced belowground biomass (82%) and rhizome bud density (83%). As flowering rush is an herbaceous perennial that propagates predominantly by rhizome buds, reductions in rhizome bud density indicate that this approach can be used for long-term reduction in flowering rush populations.

Many of these degraded wetlands have been converted to natural assets by Green-Blue interventions for resilience and sustainability. Use of appropriate natural systems and soft landscape as per the contextual demand are widely practiced and tested design principles to achieve resilience. Incorporating these principles in parks and promenade are being popular as green intervention for protection, conservation and management of such valuable wetlands. Through extensive case studies, an attempt is made to review successful water front developments and identified suitable nature based solutions for design development of wetland parks and their adaptability in urban infrastructure planning.

AB  - Risks: The 26 km long international stretch of the Alpine Rhine River between the confluence of the River Ill and the estuary into Lake Constance was canalised at the end of the 19th as well as at the beginning of the 20th century in order to alleviate the problems caused by severe major floods in the preceding years. The river alterations enabled an economic as well as an agricultural boom in the lower Rhine River valley. Today approx. 300'000 people live and work within this region due to the rectification work by the International Rhine Regulation IRR. Within the last decades the geotechnical as well as the safety standards have changed along with ecological restoration issues. Due to the significant increase of urban areas, the potential risk and vulnerability have increased tremendously. Flood control as a main goal: The main objective for the Alpine Rhine Project is an improvement of the current flood protection system. The design discharge of the project is 4'300 m3/s (equivalent to a 300-year flood), while also taking into account an extreme event of 5'800 m3/s. In order to achieve this goal, heavy construction measures with new levees and widening of the existing riverbed are necessary. All measures must fulfil today's requirements of both neighbouring countries Austria and Switzerland. This includes an improvement of the ecological situation, the preservation of the existing drinking water supply and a minimal impact on the environment during construction. Ecology and flood protection-a double win: According to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) the lower stretch of the Alpine Rhine River is considered to be "heavily modified". In order to fulfil the WFD the river needs to be ecologically restored. According to the Swiss Water Protection Act the natural river state must be achieved as far as possible. However, all parties involved agree that the original historic morphology of the Rhine River can never be fully restored. Therefore the main goal of the project is to allow as much lateral river widening as feasible. A wider cross section of the Alpine Rhine River allows both ecological restoration and the required flood protection level.

AB  - Forelands are an important part of the coastal protection system at the German coast because they significantly reduce the wave load on the dike, i.e. on the main protection element. The effectiveness of forelands in wave damping was analysed using transmission coefficient for a site at the coast of Schleswick-Holstein, Germany, on the basis of field measurements, numerical modelling with SWAN and additional physical model tests in the large wave flume GWK of the University of Hannover, Germany. Besides of the influence the ratio of water depth and wave height the transmission coefficients strongly depend on the width of the foreland. With a width of more than 325 m the foreland provides maximum damping of the incoming wave field.

AB  - Makowski, C.; Finkl, C.W., and Rusenko, K., 2011. Using Recycled Glass Cullet For Coastal Protection: A Review of Geotechnical, Biological, & Abiotic Analyses. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1362 - 1366. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208. Throughout the world, critically eroded shorelines pose a myriad of social and environmental concerns. As an increase in natural geologic and climatic events (e.g., coastal earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, weathering) occur to facilitate erosion of the Earth's coasts, shore protection becomes critically important as a preventative measure against catastrophic environmental and socio-economic damage. However, as more and more offshore sand resources are either used up or contaminated with pollutants (e.g., crude oil sub-buoyant plumes settling at the benthic interface), there is an imperative effort to explore alternatives to more traditional sand sources. One alternative involves the use of recycled glass cullet as coastal beach fill in erosional 'hot-spots'. The cullet is obtained by processing any type of glass product (e.g., bottles, containers, tanks, etc.) in such a way that it will closely match the grain size of the current native beach sediments. This specific type of recycled processing has been successful in adequately matching natural said grains. However, before the recycled glass can be directly applied to the shoreline, a series of analyses had to occur in order to determine the suitability of the cullet for a natural beach environment. This paper is a concise review of the geotechnical, biological, and abiotic analyses conducted on the recycled glass cullet for coastal protection.

AB  - The 67 km long Belgian North Sea Coast is a recent sand-barrier coast, consisting of a narrow dune and beach belt, which is the primary natural defence system against flooding of the 200.000 ha of coastal-plain lowlands, commonly called the "polders". For about a century both waterfront and polder- lowlands knew an intensive urban and resort development, combined with hard coastal defence structures and protruding seadikes, turning it into a "squeezed coast" with little or no space left for any ecological, economical or residential developments anymore. Moreover, a large part of all 240 coastal sections are subject to structural erosions of beach and dune systems resulting in an insufficient flood protection against extreme storm-events. In the same period, it appeared that the old-tech "hard coastal protection systems" - seawalls, groynes and revetments - have proved a poor efficiency, if any, in achieving a sound coastal protection, being unable to deliver safety against flooding. Moreover, these cannot be considered as sustainable anymore, because they don't cure the cause and are not capable to integrate the unknowns about future climate change and sea-level rise. The main cause of the poor sedimentological health of the beach and dune barrier in the erosive sections seems to be a chronic shortage of sand in the system. This shortage of sand causes the seaward-slope to progressively steepen, and prevents the free play of the coastal morpho-dynamics which provides the resilience for coastal protection. Protruding seawalls and shrinking sand-reserves in the system result in a "squeezed coast". In the early 90-ies, a first "morphological beach and dune restoration " was executed, which proved to be a costefficient and sustainable solution for the 10km long coastal stretch centred around De Haan. This large full-scale coastal protection scheme - unique in its kind - inspired the concept for a safe and streamlined coastline as part of the vision -plan 'Flanders Bays': it integrates various functions of the beach, including extreme storm-event response and resilience, touristic beach developments, drink and food facilities, ecosystem functions, eventfacilities,... etc. The engineering design of these "smart beach and dune nourishments" is based on the observation of natural morpho-dynamics and achieved reclamations and by replicating these natural processes: a replica of the beach morphology and the natural beach sand. Basically a "smart beach and dune nourishment" consists of: • A "shore-face nourishment" with which the LW-breaker bar is reclaimed in order to tackle any further steepening of the sub-tidal beach and the sand-demand of the submerged part of the beach; the selected sand-granulometry for reclamation is compliant with the original sand of the Low Water -breaker bar; • A "profile nourishment" of the tidal beach between Chart Datum + 1m and Chart Datum + 5m, in which the sand is profiled in compliance with the anticipated equilibrium slope of the beach in order to minimise resuspension and subsequent losses due to tidal and wave-induced currents; the selected sand -granulometry for reclamation is compliant with the original beach-sand ; • A wide "upper-beach platform" at CD + 8m, above storm-surge level, prevents any form of whitewater or blue-water wave-overtopping, providing a buffer for extreme storm-event flash-erosions and a platform for various beach developments • Flexible and removable wind-screens on the supra-tidal beach in order to capture/fix the eolian sand during the winter months. "Smart beach and dune nourishments" are presented here: as such, these were integrated in the proposed visionplan "Flanders Bays" for long-term, opportunity-building and sustainable coastal protection via a streamlined and dynamic coastline. "Flanders Bays" has been integrated in the Flemish Governmental Plan in 2011.

AB  - This coastal region of North and South Carolina is a gently sloping plain, containing large riverine estuaries, sounds, lagoons, and salt marshes. The most striking feature is the large, enclosed sound known as the Albemarle–Pamlico Estuarine System, covering approximately 7530 km2. The coast also has numerous tidal creek estuaries ranging from 1 to 10 km in length. This coast has a rapidly growing population and greatly increasing point and non-point sources of pollution. Agriculture is important to the region, swine rearing notably increasing fourfold during the 1990s.Estuarine phytoplankton communities in North Carolina are well studied; the most important taxonomic groups are diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads and cyanobacteria. Several major poorly flushed estuaries are eutrophic due to nutrient inputs, and toxic dinoflagellates (Pfiesteria spp) can reach high densities in nutrient-enriched areas. Fully marine waters are relatively oligotrophic. Southern species enter in subsurface intrusions, eddies, and occasional Gulf Stream rings, while cool water species enter with the flow of the Labrador Current to the Cape Hatteras region. The Carolinas have a low number of endemic macroalgae, but species diversity can be high in this transitional area, which represents the southernmost extension for some cold-adapted species and the northernmost extension of warm-adapted species. In North Carolina the dominant seagrass, Zostera marina, lies at its southernmost extension, while a second species, Halodule wrightii is at its northernmost extent. Widgeon-grass Ruppia maritima is common, growing in brackish water or low-salinity pools in salt marshes. Seagrass meadows are now much reduced, probably due to elevated nitrogen and increased sedimentation.In sounds, numerically dominant benthic taxa include bivalves, polychaetes and amphipods, many showing gradients in community type from mesohaline areas of the eastern shore to near marine salinities in western parts. The semi-enclosed sounds have extensive shellfisheries, especially of blue crab, northern quahogs, eastern oysters, and shrimp. Problems include contamination of some sediments with toxic substances, especially of metals and PCBs at sufficiently high levels to depress growth of some benthic macroinvertebrates. Numerous fish kills have been caused by toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks, and fish kills and habitat loss have been caused by episodic hypoxia and anoxia in rivers and estuaries. Oyster beds currently are in decline because of overharvesting, high siltation and suspended particulate loads, disease, hypoxia, and coastal development. Fisheries monitoring which began in the late 1970s shows greatest recorded landings in 1978–1982; since then, harvests have declined by about a half.Some management plans have been developed toward improving water quality and fisheries sustainability. Major challenges include; high coliform levels leading to closures of shellfish beds, a problem that has increased with urban development and increasing cover of watershed by impervious surfaces; high by-catch and heavy trawling activity; overfishing which has led to serious declines in many wild fish stocks; and eutrophication. Comprehensive plans limiting nutrient inputs are needed for all coastal rivers and estuaries, not only those that already exhibit problems. There is a critical need to improve management of non-point nutrient runoff through increased use of streamside vegetated buffers, preservation of remaining natural wetlands and construction of artificial wetlands. Improved treatment processes, based on strong incentive programmes, should also be mandated for present and future industrial-scale animal operations.

AB  - Conference Title: 2015 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS) Conference Start Date: 2015, June 9 Conference End Date: 2015, June 12 Conference Location: Denver, CO, USA The accurate and precise mapping of Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) plays a key role in the management of a region. In particular the knowledge of areas close to rivers and / or estuaries is fundamental to prevent flooding preserving the integrity of artificial structures and natural flora and fauna. Actually the mapping is performed by processing remote sensed data with a typical GSD of 0.5m. The survey is expensive and the presence of clouds could invalidate an entire survey. This kind of survey is perfect for a monitoring over a long period while is not appropriate for a quasi real time imagery. The adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a proper solution owing to the low cost and the reduced time for the setup, but it lacks of a complete view of the area. The reason is the presence of canopy that occludes the view. We integrate the images acquired by an UAV characterized by a GSD of 0.03m with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that collects images of the river from different point of view enhanced by an RGB-D sensor. The change detection algorithm applied to the collected data is based on a innovative hybrid classifier that fuses the benefit of pixel and object based approaches mapping the changes over a well defined temporal horizon.

AB  - The paper discusses the problems associated with the loss of coastal resources, which is often the result of applying traditional coast protection measures in densely developed areas. It is recommended to distinguish clearly between coast protection, as measures mainly securing the coastline, and shore protection, as measures protecting also the shore and the natural coastal resources. The planning concepts Shoreline Management Planning and Management Unit Master Planning have been discussed, in which connection the importance of obtaining broad consensus for a management strategy and for cost sharing has been highlighted. The importance of preserving the coastal resources by working with the nature has been illustrated and innovative shoreline protection principles have been proposed for different types of coastal classifications. New types of environmentally optimised coastal structures have been proposed and an overall comparison of various protection measures has been made.

Six used an RCT design, six used a controlled before-after (CBA) study design, three used a non-randomized controlled design, and one used an uncontrolled BA study design. Eleven studies were conducted in Africa and five in Asia. Five studies reported epidemiological outcomes and 15 studies reported entomological outcomes. None of the included studies reported on the environmental impacts associated with the intervention. For risk of bias, all trials had some concerns and other designs ranging from moderate to critical. Ten studies assessed habitat manipulation (temporary change to the environment). This included water management (spillways across streams; floodgates; intermittent flooding; different drawdown rates of water; different flooding and draining regimens), shading management (shading of drainage channels with different plants), other/combined management approaches (minimal tillage; disturbance of aquatic habitats with grass clearing and water replenishment), which showed mixed results for entomological outcomes. Spillways across streams, faster drawdown rates of water, shading drainage canals with Napier grass, and using minimal tillage may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes (range of effects from 95% reduction to 1.7 times increase; low-certaint evidence), and spillways across streams may reduce densities of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (low-certainty evidence). However, the effect of habitat manipulation on malaria parasite prevalence and clinical malaria incidence is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies assessed habitat manipulation with larviciding. This included reducing or removal of habitat sites; and drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs. It is uncertain whether drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs reduces malaria parasite prevalence compared to no intervention (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.83; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies assessed combination of habitat manipulation and permanent change (habitat modification). This included drainage canals, filling, and planting of papyrus and other reeds for shading near dams; and drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches. Studies did not report on epidemiological outcomes, but entomological outcomes suggest that such activities may reduce the density of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (relative risk reduction 0.49, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.50; low-certainty evidence), and preventing water stagnating using drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes compared to no intervention (ranged from 10% to 55% reductions; low-certainty evidence). Three studies assessed combining manipulation and modification with larviciding. This included filling or drainage of water bodies; filling, draining, or elimination of rain pools and puddles at water supply points and stream bed pools; and shoreline work, improvement and maintenance to drainage, clearing vegetation and undergrowth, and filling pools. There were mixed effect sizes for the reduction of entomological outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence). However, filling or draining water bodies probably makes little or no difference to malaria parasite prevalence, haemoglobin levels, or entomological inoculation rate when delivered with larviciding compared to no intervention (moderate-certainty evidence).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label="AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS">Habitat modification and manipulation interventions for preventing malaria has some indication of benefit in both epidemiological and entomological outcomes. While the data are quite mixed and further studies could help improve the knowledge base, these varied approaches may be useful in some circumstances.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - San Andrés is a coral island located in the Colombian Caribbean, 700 km northwest of the main land. Twelve kilometers in length and three kilometers in width, it is one of the most populated islands with 2.612 inhabitants per square kilometer. Its economy is based on tourism. Despite being protected from storms and hurricanes by a chain of reefs that stretches across the north and east of the island, beaches suffer significant erosion. Spratt Bight is the biggest and the most important beach of the island. Temporal evolution of Spratt Bight was analyzed and the End Point Rate for several periods (from the year 1984 to 2010) has been calculated. Although beach nourishment between 1984 and 1990, erosive processes are dominant all over the beach. Erosion rates reach up to 35 m with an average of -1.3 m/year, in its central part. The other erosive sector is placed in the half north of the beach, with a maximum of 20 m and an average of -0.7 m/year. Detected erosion can be attributed to the construction of two perpendicular structures to the shoreline and a promenade located on top of the upper beach. The rigidity of these facilities does not allow the natural evolution of the beach, disconnecting the beach from the dunes and causing significant losses of sand by wind action. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Two mangrove sites in the tropical island of Catanduanes in Bicol Region,Philippines (Lat.13.5°–14.17° N and Long. 124.1°–125.5° E) are described hereusing a paradigm for mangrove habitat restoration of mangroves that considersanthropogenic degradation and restoration following natural disturbances within the concept of climate change solution initiatives. What remains unclear for restoring the mangroves in this island are the needed (a) specific tools for landand sea-use zoning as well as integrated coastal management and ecosystembasedmanagementconcepts;(b)information[e.g.existingstressorsorresistant areas]onmanagingmangrovesforresiliencetoclimatechange;and(c)designs and ways on how to present these climate programs to the local coastal dwelling communities vis a vis sea level rise, typhoons, tidal or storm surges andtsunamis. Obstacles encountered by the local people are the (a) inappropriatepolitical intervention at the municipal/provincial levels; (b) lack of knowledge,expertise and baseline data about the biophysical conditions of the mangroveareas; and (c) differing and diverse intents on the mangrove resources leadingto communication gaps. Climate biology studies assessing plant and animalresponses to the effects of changes in typhoon patterns are needed. Finally,mangrove restoration programmes may use the Vulnerability and Adaptation (V& A) approach and address the notion that highly vulnerable coastal villagesmust evolve within the notion of “coastal management as a basic service of localgovernment”.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Mangrove forest conservation, rehabilitation and restoration (or 'mangrovization' as used in this paper) is practiced throughout the island province of Catanduanes in Luzon, Philippines to halt deforestation and degradation of coastal ecosystem and biodiversity. This study critically assesses mangrovization practices within the discourses on mangrove destruction and rehabilitation practices in this island using the lens of political ecology and Moscovici's theory of social representations emphasizing institutional arrangements and the community dynamics. Analysis was based on interviews with 61 respondents from four municipalities of Virac, San Andres, Caramoran and Baras having intact mangroves covered in the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) - National Agriculture and Fisheries Extension System (NAFES) funded program SURMABIOCON of the Catanduanes State University (CSU). A huge majority of the population in the island live along the low elevation coastal zone and are experiencing and exposed to the effects of climate change and disasters as shown in typhoon occurrence, windiness, landslide, and tidal surges. The coasts of Catanduanes are predominantly shaped coastal changes, mangrove flora and beach forest vegetation which together provide protection against coastal erosion and trap sediments resulting in coastal accretion. Results of the study shows how formal and informal institutions created by both distinct stakeholder relations can lead to some success in mangrovization. There appears to be overlapping situations and inconsistencies in the implementation of science-based and community-based mangrovization programs in support of the overall coastal resource management (CRM) as outlined in local governance. Then need for state universities to be involved in mangrovization programs/projects/activities which center on decision-making power regarding science-based and community-based initiatives on how, where, and when mangrovization should be carried out, specifically on the location of replanting or restoring mangroves in the island. The strong LGU-community-academe institutional arrangement in the island provides better contribution to the success of mangrovization. Contemporary narratives from two progressive mangrovization projects having collaboration, cooperation, and monitoring schemes with the state university is central to the notion that these projects could lead to successes. The study demonstrates how weak stakeholders can become stronger in the implementation of mangrovization initiatives that begins with capacity building and strengthening academe-mangrove association partnerships thus leading to effective coastal governance, particularly on mangrove biodiversity conservation and mangrove rehabilitation and restoration in this island of Catanduanes.

AB  - Major parts of agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid regions of India are affected by soil salinity and waterlogging in canal command area and outside. Waterlogging is caused by a rising water table and poor drainage conditions. Stress due to waterlogging and salinity are serious to plants in all stages from seed germination to active growth and maturity. Unmanaged affected agricultural lands turn into low productive marshlands in the long run. Physical provision of surface or sub-surface drainage structures can rescue in such a situation. Yet, high skill and investment are required in the installation and maintenance of such structures. Alternatively, biodrainage method has been evolved as an effective method recently world over. In biodrainage, plants are raised over a larger area, which can transpire and remove an enormous amount of water from the soil. Plants having ade-quate adaptive traits and tolerance mechanisms are desirable to mitigate waterlogging and salinity. Biodrainage is suitable in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Planting of right plant species in optimum population and geometry decides the efficiency of biodrainage. Further, combining biodrainage with the conventional drainage can improve land and water productivity. Eucalyptus is the most suitable tree species for biodrainage as it has well performed in versatile environments. It possesses appreciable tolerance to salinity, sodicity and waterlogged conditions of the soil. Fast-growing with a straight trunk, deep rooting ability, low shading effect and high transpiration capacity are promising characteristics of this tree. Prominent woody species like Acacia nilotica, Dalbergia sissoo, Hard-wickia binata can also be grown for high profit. © 2018: Author (s).

AB  - This paper is focused on topic of exploration structural health monitoring which serve for several purposes. However, optimization of design and construction of MFARs considering civil and environmental engineering means is poorly investigated. The aim of this paper is to describe define structural monitoring capabilities which were implemented to creation of Multifunctional artificial reefs (MFAR). Prospective reef will be capable to perform as a potential tool for marine biodiversity restoration and rehabilitation, coastal protection to prevent erosion of a shore line and a scientific platform with various sensors able to self-monitoring and sensing ambient environment. Main efforts have been dedicated to review of existing state of the art on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods for offshore systems and computations of fluid-structure interaction to validate possible approaches. Suggestions in optimization of future sensors integration for monitoring structural health and environmental variables have been provided based on data from state of the art and simulation results. Delivered artificial reef design will serve as a base for future manufacturing of the artificial reef modules to help provide insight in how human-made construction may affect marine and coastal ecosystems. © 2018 IEEE.

Lee, developed concretes that could be placed underwater for construction of coastal defense facilities. General Q. A. Gillmore, whose device for measuring time of setting of cement paste is still used, published a book in 1863 on hydraulic cement and mortar. In 1871, he published a book on concrete which introduced concrete technology from France that was significantly higher-performance than that then used in the United States. Contemporary development of high-performance concrete began in 1935 at the CE Concrete Laboratory at Eastport, Maine, in support of the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power project. The objective was to develop concrete able to resist twice daily immersion in sea water and freezing in the winter when the tide went out. That objective was achieved. In 1970, when confronted with the problem of severe abrasion-erosion damage in stilling basins below dams, a solution was found in the development of concretes having strengths greater than 100 MPa. This was done using silica fume and high-range water-reducing admixtures. Similar and higher-strength high-performance concretes have also been developed for defense purposes as part of the protective-structures portion of the U.S. military research and development (R&D) program. When stronger concrete or concrete that must resist a more severe exposure is needed, the Corps of Engineers' concrete R&D capability has been able to develop it, and I expect it will continue to be able to do so. © 1996 American Concrete Institute.

AB  - Submerged breakwaters are one of the most fundamental structures to protect coastal areas from wave action. To ensure the stability of a whole structure, it is primarily important to determine the required mass of armor units accurately. This study aims to evaluate the armor block stability based on a flow field calculated by a numerical wave flume. The flow field was calculated by using a 2D VOF-type numerical wave flume. The wave force acting on an armor block was calculated using the Morison formula. Drag, inertia and lift coefficients for the Morison formula were determined by using an exact 3D VOF-type numerical model. The resultant stability of the armor block was judged from a comparison between the wave force and the stabilizing force originating from the mass of the armor block. An evaluation method for the critical condition of armor block stability of submerged breakwaters is proposed. Parameters for the evaluation were calibrated through comparisons between experimental and numerical results. An impact wave force with short duration acted when the water depth above the breakwater was shallow. In such a situation, even if the peak value was large, the impulse was not so large. To estimate the displacement of the block, the equation of the motion of the block was solved. The agreement between predicted and experimental stability was improved by using the fluid force coefficient corresponding to an individual water depth condition. That is to say, the applicability of the model was shown to have improved. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - On September 27, 1996, the T/V JULIE N inbound with a cargo of 8.8 million gallons of #2 fuel oil struck the Million Dollar Bridge, spanning Portland Harbor between Portland and South Portland, Maine. The incident resulted in a spill of approximately 180,000 gallons of oil, which spread throughout a large area of Portland Harbor. The marine and coastal resources of Portland Harbor and the Fore River, including water resources, shellfish, wetlands, sediments, and birds were exposed and/or injured by the oil. The spill also had an adverse impact on several different public use services. The natural resource trustee agencies (including the State of Maine, NOAA, and the Department of the Interior) and Amity Products Carriers, Inc. (Responsible Party, RP) conducted a cooperative natural resource damage assessment to assess and restore natural resources exposed and/or injured by the spill. The trustees and RP operated under an initial verbal agreement to cooperate until a written agreement was executed over a year after the incident. The cooperative process and lessons learned are described in the paper. Particularly positive components included cooperative data collection and active collaboration on study design and endpoints. The trustees expended $782,860 in assessment costs. The RP expended an additional $169,101 in cooperative laboratory and field investigations, as well as $364,720 in consultant costs. The total assessment costs were $1,316,681. The trustees and the RP were then able to successfully negotiate a $1 million dollar settlement for the purpose of planning, implementing, and overseeing selected restoration projects. These projects included reducing the discharge of PAH's into the Fore River, wetland and bird habitat restoration, and construction of a recreational trail along the Fore River. The RP sought compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund under the limitation of liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Compensation included expenses beyond statutory liability for response, NRDA assessment, and damages to natural resources among others.

AB  - In 1993, an incident involving three vessels near the entrance to Tampa Bay, near St. Petersburg, Florida, resulted in a discharge approximately 300,000 gallons of No. 6. fuel oil into the waters off Egmont Key. The oil contacted the shores from Egmont Key to locations approximately 14 miles to the north. Oil also entered Boca Ciega Bay through John's Pass and impacted four small islands that supported mature overwash mangrove forest. A cooperative damage assessment process was developed between the Responsible Parties (RPs) and the trustees for the natural resources: the state of Florida, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Through the cooperative process, several alternatives for primary and compensatory restoration were developed. In considering alternatives to compensate for impacts to epibenthic communities, fish and bird habitats, wetlands, and mangrove communities, the trustees and the RPs considered purchase of shoreline habitat and restoration of mangrove forest at several sites. The RP developed a proposal to purchase and deed into public ownership in perpetuity, a 10.67-acre parcel of land on the west bank of Cross Bayou in Boca Ciega Bay that had been used as a disposal site for dredge spoil in the past. This site consisted of approximately 5.0 acres of uplands, 4.4 acres of mangrove forest, and 1.4 acres of nonmangrove intertidal and subtidal habitat. The objective of the project was to establish a typical Tampa Bay mangrove forest and a roadside buffer free of exotic plant species. The secondary goals were to establish a typical Tampa Bay salt marsh dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina spp.) as a successional precursor to mangrove recruitment by seeds and seedlings. Tidal exchange through the site was reestablished to improve water quality and increase export of mangrove detritus and import of high-quality tidal waters. The project was designed and constructed by the RPs with the approval and supervision of the trustees. The project was completed and title transferred to Pinellas County, Florida in summer 1999. A monitoring program was developed and performance criteria established by trustee representatives and the RPs. The monitoring program currently is being conducted and has met performance criteria to date. This project demonstrates the positive result of trustees and the RPs working together to provide compensation to the environment.

AB  - This paper highlights the geotechnical challenges faced during reclamation of a soft soil site for an international container shipping terminal in Southern Vietnam. The terminal incorporates a pile-supported wharf with a barge quay and a 60-hectare (150-acre) upland development for container storage. This paper focuses on the settlement and slope stability challenges associated with reclamation of the upland portion of the terminal. Prior to development, the site comprised an intertidal salt marsh with ground surface elevation ranging from about -1 to +3.5 meters (-3.5 to +11.5 feet). Geotechnical exploration and testing indicated that the site was underlain by up to about 45 meters (150 feet) of very soft to stiff, highly compressible clay soils overlying medium dense to very dense sand deposits. In order to accommodate the design tidal range, development plans called for raising site grades to an average elevation of +6 meters (+19.5 feet). Settlement analyses indicated that consolidation settlement in excess of 3 meters (10 feet) could occur in the area of the container yard when site grades were raised and working loads applied. In order to reduce post-construction settlement, a preloading program using closely spaced prefabricated vertical drains was undertaken. Slope stability analyses indicated that placing fill over the weak clay soils would destabilize the waterside slope. Through a series of iterations of geotechnical design and collaboration between the civil/structural and geotechnical engineers, a buttressing system using a thickened section of blanket stone and armor stone was constructed to maintain the stability of the slope.

AB  - Phytoremediation, the use of green plants to treat and control wastes in water, soil, and air, is an important part of the new field of ecological engineering. In situ and ex situ applications are governed by site soil and water characteristics, nutrient sustainability, meteorology, hydrology, feasible ecosystems, and contaminant characteristics. Phytotoxicity and mass transport limitations or bioavailability tend to be critical in applications. Most applications are inexpensive due to the reliance on sunlight and recycling of nutrients in situ but treatments over large land areas and longer times for treatment are usually limited to root zones and shallow water. Applications of wetlands, grasslands, crops, and tree plantations have been successful for a variety of wastes, usually present in low concentrations that are not acutely phytotoxic. Organic and inorganic wastes include metals and metalloids, some xenobiotic contaminants, and salts leachate, sewage, sludge, and other conventional wastes. Some redundant or back-up treatment may be necessary depending on the acuteness of toxicity to offset the variability of biological systems. However, very few phytoremediation techniques have been optimized for sustainability using the fundamental principles of ecological engineering. Applications of monocultures of hybrids and sometimes alien species, and simple ecosystems of plants and microorganisms are feasible but difficult to apply in some cases. Self-engineering and self-design need to be explored and used to apply sustainable ecosystems to manage wastes. The key to applying sustainable ecosystems is the knowledge of the genetic and proteomic diversity necessary to select plants and other organisms with optimal activities to transform or accumulate pollutants. Most of the proteomes of plants (approximately 10 000 proteins for all species) have not been adequately explored to optimize and understand the range of possible phytoremediation applications. Furthermore, the metabolism or degradation of the approximately 200 000 secondary plant metabolites needs to be understood. If the structure and activity of a xenobiotic chemical are similar to that of a secondary metabolite, there is a good chance that a sustainable phytoremediation application is possible. Because some xenobiotic compounds may not be analogous to any secondary metabolite, some genetic engineering may be necessary to sustainably manage these unusual wastes. Plants seem to be the optimal organism in which to transplant (1) microbial genes to achieve more mineralization of organic contaminants and (2) mammalian genes that may have greater activity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 1993 the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project (SMBRP) established the Public Involvement and Education (PIE) Fund to support programs that creatively and effectively educate Los Angeles County residents about ways to 1) restore and protect Santa Monica Bay, and 2) maintain a health ecosystem for the region. The SMBRP funds numerous outreach programs developed both by and for government and other public agencies, educators, environmental organizations, trade groups, business professionals, artists, etc. These projects represent the efforts of those who are committed to protecting coastal and inland resources such as aquatic, marine and coastal habitats; drinking water sources; wetlands; beaches/intertidal zones; etc. A specific project funded through the PIE program is highlighted in this paper - it addresses the need for providing a tool to help cities and industries educate themselves about storm water-related issues. The tool, a workshop module, was developed to do just this; it's a step-by-step manual that outlines the procedures to successfully host a storm water educational workshop.

AB  - <jats:p><p>With climate change becoming more widely understood, we are beginning to see how this phenomenon is impacting on our ability to live coastally. Coastal properties represent some of the most expensive real estate in the country, however these properties are being battered by increasing storm surges causing coastal erosion and decay to the land on which they sit. This is resulting in people fighting to keep their homes out of the water, along with an increasing need for a solution to keep the water out of their homes. In Raumati, sea walls began appearing in the 1950s with people blocking their individual properties from the ocean with wooden log walls. These walls have continued to get larger, higher and more solid until they have become the rock accumulation, stone path and concrete walls that stand today along almost the entire length of the Kapiti Coast.  The impact of such walls is that, while they protect the land immediately behind them, they cause greater issues further down the coast, causing sections of the coastline to deteriorate at a far more accelerated rate. The aim of this project will be to put an end to the Kapiti sea wall by addressing the site at the southern end of Raumati where this erosion is becoming increasingly evident. Here, the delicate sand dunes are being eaten away by heightened storm surges and an ever-increasing sea level.  Rather than looking at it as a negative effect, this thesis will explore the opportunities that are opened by this decay. The project proposes the reinstating and re-wetting of the once drained wetlands that lie behind the natural dunes. Above these wetlands, a ranger’s hut will act as a home, embassy and church within Queen Elizabeth Park. This allows for a greater sense of custodianship, with more people coming, going and staying within the park. The project outcome will be a building that combines public and private spaces. It will allow for the fluctuation in sea levels to interact with and become a part of the building, rather than being excluded through traditional approaches to dealing with climate change on coastlines. Hence, this ranger’s hut will put an end to the sea wall.</p></jats:p>

AB  - The Boscombe Reef is a multipurpose reef structure designed primarily for the enhancement of surfing amenity at Boscombe, Poole Bay, England. The reef was designed to maximise the small and generally poor-quality surfing wave climate of the eastern English Channel coast. The reef was constructed from 54 large, sand filled geotextile containers ranging in size from 1 to 5 m diameters and 15 to 70 m long with a total volume of approximately 13,000 m 3. Construction of the reef began in the summer of 2008, was suspended during the following winter and was completed in the late summer of 2009. The reef is now in service and provides a high intensity right hand surfing ride of up to 70 m and a shorter left hand ride of up to 30 m. Although the reef was not designed as a coastal protection structure, monitoring of the morphological response supports that the reef promotes shore protection through the formation of an inshore salient.

AB  - Coastal cities face flood-related hazards exacerbated by climate change and sea level rise, including erosion, storm surge, high wave events, and increased flood frequencies. In order to minimize flood damage and prolong the use of coastal lands, nature-based infrastructure and living shorelines can provide habitat, dissipate wave energy, and maintain people’s connection to the water. In this chapter, the living shorelines approach to planning, designing, and evaluating resilient coastal communities is described and evaluated for two different communities on the island of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. One is a rural, high energy wave environment, Sunset Beach, while the other is a medium wave energy, urban resort district, Waikiki Beach. After identifying flood risks over time, site-specific restoration of coastal sand dunes, vegetation (groundcover, shrubs, trees), and coral reefs are proposed through interactive visualization methods alongside supporting case studies. The principles, tools, and techniques for planners, designers, and practitioners involved in coastal hazard mitigation and adaptation are described. Future research needs are identified such as quantify flood mitigation effectiveness; measure costs and benefits; and enact policies to require consideration and ease implementation of living shorelines.

AB  - This paper presents the results of exhaustive experimental work focused on evaluating the efficiency of two devices as wave energy converters and as coastal protection alternatives. The first device is a wave amplifier that by means of overtopping stores water in a reservoir where potential energy can be used to produce power. The second device, the Blow-Jet, is a novel proposal that gathers together the operation of a tapchan and a blowhole to generate an intermittent jet that can easily feed a turbine. Results show that for both devices there is a strong dependency on the wave climate but that there is a possibility of optimizing geometric designs. Transmission coefficient values obtained for the Blow-Jet point to a real chance for its use as a multi-purpose coastal structure.

AB  - Over the past fifty years, the intensive use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture (both inorganic fertilizers and liquid manures) as well as the increase in urban emissions has significantly boosted the terrigenous inputs of nutrient substances into the aquatic environment. In many parts of the world, this enrichment in nitrate (resulting mainly from the leaching and washing out of arable soils and land), as well as in ammonium (very abundant in urban waste emissions) and phosphate (coming from urban wastes and arable soils erosion), has caused a change in the nutrient balance of aquatic environments, called eutrophication. This phenomenon is expressed by a superabundant algal production often followed by a drop in dissolved oxygen levels prejudicial to fauna, and a modification of the algal biodiversity. Eutrophication initially affected lakes with very slow renewal, but then spread to many major rivers, and finally, over the last thirty years, to some large estuaries and bays. The phenomenon of lethal anoxia can occur in summer over vast areas of shallow seas influenced by the inputs of large rivers. The French coasts are generally little affected by the phenomena of massive eutrophication owing to the tidal currents in the English Channel-Atlantic region and the rapidly increasing water depths of the Mediterranean. However, there are some local cases of very disturbed sites, some displaying a proliferation of green macroalgae ("green tides" in Brittany), and others affected by a rapid multiplication of phytoplankton (bays of the Vilaine, Seine and Somme). In fresh water, phosphorus is the main limiting nutrient and the factor controlling plant production (SCHINDLER etal., 1978). In marine environments, by contrast, phosphorus maintains this key role only in the brackish waters of river plumes, and this is only observed in spring: along with silicon, phosphorus can control the intensity of the spring diatom bloom. But summer blooms, in particular those involving dinoflagellates (several of which are toxic) and species generating hypoxia at the bottom in stratified seas, remain controlled by nitrogen, in the same way as the coastal "green tides" caused by green seaweed (Ulva, Enteromorpha, Monostroma, etc.). Mathematical modelling studies of these two types of eutrophication (caused by phytoplankton or macroalgae) help improve our understanding of the respective roles of nitrogen and phosphorus in causing these harmful effects and improve the quality of recommendations for their mitigation. Retrospective simulations of the past thirty years show that, by strongly decreasing the urban and industrial phosphorus emissions, but without decreasing the agricultural nitrogen inputs, we have certainly reduced the spring blooms of diatoms. However, at the same time, we have enhanced the competitiveness of prymnesiophyte nanoflagellates, which are able to grow in waters almost exhausted in phosphorus: this explains the importance of coastal foams of Phaeocystis that affect the shorelines in May from the Baie de Somme to the German Bight.

AB  - Analysis of data from four extensive fish surveys in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary indicated that splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus, endemic to the Central Valley of California, declined by 62% over a 13-year period. Splittails are now found mostly in the estuary, a fraction of their former range. In a gill-net survey in August 1994, 50% of the splittails taken in the estuary were from the Suisun Bay area, and 50% were just upstream in shallow, well- vegetated areas. Splittails migrate into freshwater to spawn, and river outflow carries juveniles into productive, shallow, low-salinity areas downstream. The high correlation of abundance of young with river outflow (average r2, 0.60) and a weak stock-reeruitment relationship (r2 = 0.22) indicate that spawning success depends on favorable environmental conditions created by high outflows, such as the number of days that lowland areas remain flooded in the spring. A repeated- measures analysis of variance indicated that splittails prefer shallow, low-salinity habitats. The reductions in splittail abundance and range and the movements and habitat preferences of splittail young and adults correspond to trends and habits of two other species characteristic of the estuary, delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys. The largest threats to these three species are changes in water management and increases in water diversions that reduce spawning and rearing areas and other low-salinity habitats in Suisun Bay. © 1995 by the American Fisheries Society.

AB  - This paper reflects the realisation of an Integrated Master Plan to protect the Flemish coastline against erosion and flooding on a short and long term basis, looking ahead at the year 2050. Different measures and alternatives to prevent present and future flooding are being worked out on the basis of safety checks and flood risk calculations along the entire coast. The different solutions will be subjected to a social cost - benefit analysis and an environmental impact assessment. The final master plan is expected to be ready in 2010 and will detail the priorities and the needs for coastal protection investments along the coastline. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

AB  - Recent studies showed that one third of the Belgian coastline is not sufficiently protected against severe storm events. Therefore coastal protection plans are set up to assure a minimum safety standard for the entire coastline. Flood risk calculations constitute the main input parameter for the concept and planning phases. Since 100% safety can never be guaranteed, contingency plans are constructed to reduce the remaining flood risks. Flood risk calculations are a powerful communicative and operational instrument to use between engineers and experts on the field, thus forming the link between coastal management and disaster planning.

AB  - Jamaica Bay, located within the Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, New York City, covers 67.3 square kilometers and opens into the Atlantic Ocean via Rockaway Inlet. In the early 1900's, Jamaica Bay was an extensive estuarine ecosystem that sustained large expanses of salt marsh. Over the last century, urban and industrial development has modified the natural environment surrounding the marsh islands through activities such as dredging and filling, construction, pollution, and over-harvesting or eradication of native plant and animal species. Based on aerial photography interpretation of Jamaica Bay, the New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC), estimated that approximately 567 hectares of tidal salt marsh have been lost since 1924, with the rate of loss rapidly increasing in recent years. At Elders Point between 1994 and 1999 an estimated 89 hectares of salt marsh were lost at a rate of 17.8 hectares per year. It is estimated that if this trend continues, all remaining salt marsh within Jamaica Bay may be lost over the next three decades. Our work involves a multi-agency group led by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to restore the tidal wetlands of Elders Point East and consists of the placement of fill, regrading the site to appropriate elevations for the target community, and planting with native coastal plant species. This design was based on the approximate extent of the 1974 marsh coverage as reported by NYSDEC. Restoration efforts have included extensive monitoring to ensure worthwhile ecological goals have been provided and are a long term sustainable benefit to Jamaica Bay. Challenges that need to be overcome include compaction, subsidence, and erosion of placed material. Additionally, accretion of material and plant survival will require monitoring. The sustainability and plant survival will be an ongoing challenge with physical, chemical, and biological stresses present in the bay. Monitoring data to date have indicated that the project has provided much of the anticipated benefits with minimal erosion or deposition of sediment and Spartina alterniflora has exhibited a growth rate consistent with the control marsh at JoCo. The sustainability of Elders Point East will have important implications regarding future salt marsh restoration efforts (e.g., Elders Point West) and likely serve as a benchmark for similar projects.

AB  - The intentional release of an estimated 11 million barrels of oil during the 1991 Gulf War was the largest oil spill in history. An assessment of the physical, chemical, and ecological impacts of this spill shows that, 12 years later, oil residues and habitat modifications continue to have toxic effects on intertidal communities. As of 2003, there are an estimated 8 million cubic meters of oiled sediment remaining along the 803 km of impacted shoreline in Saudi Arabia. Of this volume, 45% occurs in muddy tidal flats and 23% in salt marshes and mangroves. Much of the oil in these sheltered habitats occurs as oiled crab burrows, with liquid oil remaining in the burrows to depths that exceed 50 cm. These habitats show the lowest degree of ecological recovery since the spill, with 87% of the upper intertidal zones of mangroves and marshes and 71% of muddy tidal flats having reduced species richness and a disturbed community structure. Those habitats exposed to the greatest amount of wave activity contain the smallest amount of residual oil; however, on outer sand beaches, the oil is commonly buried to depths exceeding 1 m. The factors that affect the ecological recovery of the intertidal habitats include: 1) The chemical toxicity of the oil residues; 2) the physical toxicity of heavy and hardened oil residues; 3) other physical barriers that affect seed germination of plants, settlement of larvae, and burrowing; 4) limited sources for recruitment of biota; 5) reduced hydrological functioning of tidal channels. This study shows the importance of oil removal as the first phase of habitat recovery. It also indicates the potential for large-scale damage by blatant acts of ecoterrorism.

AB  - In 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard developed an Incident Action Plan (IAP) to remove oil and hazardous materials from nine foreign-owned tuna longliner vessels grounded on the reef flat within Pago Pago Harbor, American Samoa. This plan involved the construction of rock and trestle causeways and rock working platforms to access the clusters of vessels, and partial removal of the vessels to access the oil and hazardous materials onboard. A natural resource damage assessment (NRDA) study was conducted to quantify the injuries associated with the response action and scale emergency restoration alternatives. A rapid field assessment program was implemented to characterize the benthic habitats around the grounded vessels and in the footprints of the proposed rock and trestle causeways and working platforms. Likely impacts to the dominant habitat types (coral, algal turf, and Halimeda/algal turf communities) from the proposed response actions were: (1) crushing and mortality in areas of fill deposition; (2) partial crushing in spillage zones around fill areas; (3) damages to the reef flat rock platform and framework due to collapse and fracturing; (4) physical injury from remobilization of residual materials remaining on the flat after fill removal; (5) water quality impacts from increased suspended sediment levels during fill placement, use, and removal; and (6) shading impacts to biota under trestles. These injuries were quantified in terms of the dimensions and degree of mortality and/or reduced function for different impacts. Habitat recovery rates for physical crushing and shading were developed, as well. Emergency restoration options were identified and scaled in terms of habitat credits, with one of the preferred options being complete removal of the vessel hulls followed by reef stabilization.

AB  - The sand dune habitats found on barrier islands and other coastal areas support a dynamic plant community while protecting areas further inland from waves and wind. Foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats common to most coastal dunes have very different vegetation, likely because of the interplay among plant succession, exposure, disturbance, and resource availability. However, surprisingly few long-term data are available describing dune vegetation patterns. A nine-year census of 294 plots on St. George Island, Florida suggests that the major climatic drivers of vegetation patterns vary with habitat. Community structure is correlated with the elevation, soil moisture, and percent soil ash of each 1 m2 plot. Major storms reduce species richness in all three habitats. Principle coordinate analysis suggests that changes in the plant communities through time are caused by climatic events: changes in foredune vegetation are correlated with temperature and summer precipitation, interdune vegetation with storm surge, and backdune vegetation with precipitation and storm surge. We suggest that the plant communities in foredune, interdune, and backdune habitats tend to undergo succession toward particular compositions of species, with climatic disturbances pushing the communities away from these more deterministic trajectories.

Recently the French way of coastal protection against sea erosion has been seriously modified. A critical review of coastal works and practices has brought in to question the power of the Corps of Engineers and the capacity they have to understand the best approach to adopt. As a consequence, a series of texts propose a new definition of coastal protection policy. -English summary

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sewage treatments are not efficient to eliminate enteric microorganisms. Viruses are able to persist and are discharged into the marine environment with treated effluents. Few data are now available on the magnitude and the contributive processes of marine viral contamination. This work evaluates the relationship between the magnitude of rainfall and the viral contamination of the marine environment during winter epidemics of gastroenteritis in human coastal populations. METHODS: A RT-PCR method was used to detect enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk-like virus, astrovirus and rotavirus in shellfish, harvested monthly between August 1995 and July 1998. The frequency of virus detection in shellfish was expressed as an Index of Viral Contamination. Acute gastroenteritis in the population was estimated using the French Sentinel System for Monitoring of Communicable Diseases. Rainfall effects on the efficiency of sewage treatment were assessed using an estimated staying time of sewage effluents in the plant. RESULTS: The results indicate that the highest viral contamination occurs in winter. Maximal indexes of viral contamination were respectively 70% in January 1996, 100% in January 1997, but only 31% in January 1998. Viral contamination variations seemed to follow the pattern of the winter epidemic of acute gastroenteritis in the local population in 1996 and 1997. These observations should be linked to the winter rainfalls. Heavy rains on short periods of time could create an hydraulic overload in the sewage treatment plant, reducing the staying time of the sewage effluents and thus the efficiency of the disinfection process. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the viral contamination of shellfish seems to result from the simultaneity between the winter epidemics of acute gastroenteritis in the coastal population and heavy rainfall. To prevent public health hazards associated with shellfish consumption, the monitoring of microbiological quality in shellfish harvesting areas should include accompagning survey of viral epidemic in the coastal population, and of sewage outputs in the coastal environment.

AB  - Traditionally, coffee is cultivated under a shading canopy of native trees in tropical areas of the world. Within the U.S., coffee is cultivated only in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Shade coffee plantations are a simplified but stable agro-ecosystem. Their shading canopy provides most of the ecological functions of natural environments such as nutrient recycling, habitat for native, endemic and migratory birds, and shelter for many plant and wildlife species including endangered species. In Puerto Rico, shade coffee plantations have played a critical role in protecting biodiversity by providing habitat and reducing sedimentation during a time period when the landscape was severely deforested. During these times, coffee plantations served as refugia for many species and protected marine environments by reducing runoff and pollution. Now, shade coffee has a similar or even more important role than it did during the first half of the 20th century. With the ever-increasing human population and associated development and the fact that coffee became Puerto Rico's principal agricultural crop, these plantations are a vital component of any conservation initiative in tropical United States. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Partners for Fish & Wildlife Program in the Caribbean focuses on the restoration of the native shading canopy in coffee plantations. This is the only shade coffee restoration effort currently occurring within the U.S. Of the similar to 10,000 hectares of coffee in Puerto Rico, less than 40% are under shade. We developed simple habitat restoration procedures in order to protect Federal trust resources in tropical U.S. We use native vegetation in spatial arrangement that provide important habitat for wildlife and reduces erosion and runoff, while maintaining the agricultural value and the acceptance of landowners. In only five years, we started the program and have restored more than 600 ha. The Service's efforts with shade coffee restoration projects provide a model to be used as a management tool for private lands around tropical forest reserves in the U.S. and elsewhere protecting not only upland areas but also enhancing the health of coastal ecosystems. These practices are also an economical incentive for a sustainable way of farming which protects the environment and conserves the traditional way of cultivating the land in tropical environments.

AB  - The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30–500 m. The result highlights that about 60.33% of the total transects of the study area was eroded, but only 24.99% of the total transects experienced accretion, and 14.68% of the total transects depicted stability. The scientific study will benefit coastal managers and policymakers in formulating action plans for coastal zone management, natural resilience, and sustainable future development.

AB  - Extreme heat events cause patchy mortality in many habitats. We examine biophysical mechanisms responsible for patchy mortality in beds of the competitively dominant ecosystem engineer, the marine mussel Mytilus californianus, on the west coast of the United States. We used a biophysical model to predict daily fluctuations in body temperature at sites from southern California to Washington and used results of laboratory experiments on thermal tolerance to determine mortality rates from body temperature. In our model, we varied the rate of thermal conduction within mussel beds and found that this factor can account for large differences in body temperature and consequent mortality during heat waves. Mussel beds provide structural habitat for other species and increase local biodiversity,but, as sessile organisms, they are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions. Identifying critical biophysical mechanisms related to mortality and ecological performance will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these vulnerable ecosystems. ©.

AB  - Norton culture (ca. 740 BC–AD 1000) sites are ubiquitous across the western Arctic. Based on artifact and settlement data, it is generally agreed that Norton culture south of Seward Peninsula possessed a mixed marine-focused economy dominated by seasonally available Pacific salmon. However, the few direct studies of Norton subsistence, thus far, have suggested an emphasis on marine mammals rather than salmon. We present the results of a zooarchaeological midden analysis from the large Norton site of Difchahak (49-NOB-005) near Shaktoolik on Norton Sound, Alaska. We argue the faunal remains recovered from this site reflect its local estuarine system. Inhabitants were able to maintain year-round occupation of the region through an expansion of netting technology to non-salmon prey species. The economic focus at Difchahak was on mass capture of several seasonally available taxa, including salmon, mussels, saffron cod, ptarmigan, ducks, geese, and seal. Comparison of these faunal remains to those from Norton culture deposits at the neighboring site of Iyatayet suggests that differences between the localities are largely driven by geographically dependent prey-species distributions, and these two sites may represent complementary parts to a broad logistical foraging system.

AB  - Pitcher plant bogs, also referred to as hillside seepages bogs or hillside bogs, are extremely restricted on the West Gulf Coastal Plain. the number and extent of extant bogs is in the low hundreds, comprising no more than a few thousand hectares of habitat. These bogs support a large number of plant species of significant conservation concern. threats to existing bogs include: land use changes, silvicultural impacts, fire scarcity, vehicle damage, negative feral hog (Sus scrofa) impact, and ground water regime alterations. Two pitcher plant bogs on the angelina National forest were subjected to severe damage from vehicular impacts that eliminated herbaccous vegetation, disturbed the soil to substantial depths, and initiated severe erosion. A restoration effort that replaced lost soil, reduced erosion, and allowed subsequent revegetation was implemented. Approximately four years post-treatment, bogs are intact, soil erosion is controlled, revegetation is complete or progessing, and at least some species of conservation concern are present in the revegetated areas. These restoration projects ahve demonstrated and degraded pitcher plant bogs that have suffered severe damage due to vehicular impacts can be substantially restored if sufficient resources are available. However, pitcher plant bogs on the West Gulf Coastal Plain continue to be threatened by uncontrolled off-road behicles and other impacts. The most insidious threat may be the widespread lack of sufficient fire required to preclude or reverse succession to communities dominated by woody vegetation and subsequent loss of the herbaceous bog species.

AB  - Coastal foredunes are natural features, reflecting interaction among geomorphological, biological and ecological processes. Their formation depends on a wide range of spatially and temporally variable environmental factors, but is usually associated with strong and prevailing onshore winds, an ample supply of sediment for aeolian transport and the presence of vegetation to trap sand. Foredunes can, however, be found under more complex wind regimes where offshore winds are common such as the UK East coast, Northern Ireland, and New Zealand. This paper documents the evolution of the foredunes along the North Lincolnshire coast, and in particular at two sites, one characterized by a wide beach and the second by a small vegetated embryo dunefield on the upper beach. Historical ortho-images from 1953 to 2009 were generated from vertical aerial photographs. These were combined with an analysis of historical climate and oceanographic external forcing factors to attempt to explain the spatial and temporal variability in foredune evolution. The medium-term foredune tendency indicates a mean seaward migration of 2 m year ^sup -1^ along this coastline. The general evolutionary pattern of the accretional coastal foredunes reflects the impacts of the forcing factors and suggests rapid recovery following storm-surges.

AB  - Shallow water flow models are an important tool for forecasting storm surges and predicting the effects of human interventions in estuaries. The accuracy of shallow water flow models is mainly determined by the accuracy of its inputs, such as depth, friction coefficient and the tide at the so called open boundary. In order to obtain accurate model results, the model has to be calibrated, which means that the model input is adapted so that the model results fit the available measurements more closely. For this purpose an automatic calibration method, based on the adjoint method, has been developed to estimate the uncertain parameters in an efficient way. The parameters are adapted in a way to increase the similarity between the measured waterlevels and the computed waterlevels. Recently the shallow water flow models are being used increasingly to provide the input for pollutant and sediment transport models. This change in use has resulted in a demand for more accurate current predictions. For this purpose, the calibration method has been extended to improve the current predictions of the shallow water flow models.

AB  - Since the early ages tropical insular societies have lived on the oceans edge depending on it for essential functions ranging from transportation and nourishment to recreation. These services are also accompanied by the risk posed by hazardous winds, waves, currents, storm surge and tsunamis. In recent times coastal societies have also faced the risk of losing valuable services provided by the ocean due to anthropogenic disturbances. Technological and scientific advances have made possible to detect and even predict with reasonable accuracy almost all major threats coming from the ocean. Moreover, although the timing of events like tsunamis cannot be predicted their potential impact can be assessed. Under the US Integrated Ocean Observing System, the Caribbean Coastal Ocean Observing System (CariCOOS) faces the challenge to provide decision making support required for improving the safety of coastal communities and marine operations, enhance the economy through enhanced efficiency of the latter and by and protecting the environment. Major achievements toward the above goals include the deployment of data buoys and meteorological stations at representative areas and the operational implementation of high resolution wave and weather models capable of accurately filling observational gaps and providing accurate wind and wave and nearshore breaker height forecasts. A storm surge atlas is now in use by state and federal agencies. An assessment of the chronicity of sediment inputs to sensitive coral reefs, utilizing remote sensed ocean color data is available to resource managers. Below we discuss approaches and strategies followed implementing the system as well that to be followed for its further development.

AB  - Renewed interest in tidal energy in the UK has triggered new debates about the possible benefits of constructing a tidal barrage across the Severn Estuary and several other estuaries and bays in England. This paper explores the use of analogues to provide an initial picture of the likely responses. It describes the critical elements of the responses identified in the analogues and highlights the pathways that are responsible for observed changes. The analogues used can be applied to a range of structures; from tidal energy barrages to tidal fences and tidal reefs, as well as to tidal lagoons within estuaries. The critical relationship that emerges is that between sub-tidal depositional environments and the effects of wind-driven wave erosion within the inter-tidal zone. Erosion by wind-driven waves leads to sediment suspension and subsequent deposition in deeper sub-tidal water where reduced tidal propagation also limits re-mobilisation that is needed to return sediment onto inter-tidal environments during sediment-building phases. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The population biology and ecology of scallops in Greater Omaha Bay (a semi-oceanic bay) and Kawau Bay (a estuarine bay) was quantified by observation and experiment. Information was collected to extend the knowledge base on northern New Zealand scallop population dynamics, and for application to potential scallop enhancement in the region. Contagious scallop population organisation was found at all spatial scales examined, ranging from bay wide through to individual bed patchiness, down to the scale of inter-animal distances. Such clumping has strong implications for a range of population processes, including fishing susceptibility and fertilisation success. Monitoring of adults found two main spawning events to occur; in late October and in mid January. Changes in the gonado-somatic index (GSI) were well synchronised between individuals within populations. Subsequent monitoring of spat-fall in artificial collectors documented two main recruitment events, probably the outcomes of the two local spawning events. These spat-fall events occurred on collectors separated by 1Os of km. However, substantial density variations occurred between sites, indicating that local hydrodynamics may have played a significant role in modifying local spat-fall intensities. Smaller spat-fall events were also present between the two major events. The number of spat collected at a number of combinations of site and time were sufficient to support commercial spat catching operations, although problems were encountered with spat detaching at sizes too small to be retained by the collectors. In the 1993/94 summer a large algal bloom event completely eliminated scallop recruitment to collectors for the first three months of that season. Mass mortality events were a major contributor to overall benthic scallop population mortality. Probable causes included intensive scallop harvesting (commercial and recreational), a major storm episode, and a large algal bloom. These effectively eliminated scallop populations from Greater Omaha Bay. The adjacent Kawau Bay was not affected by any of these particular events, but populations there did not survive long after reaching adult sizes. Estimates of M (natural mortality) were higher for all scallop populations than have been previously documented in New Zealand studies. Growth trajectories were reasonably consistent in waters shallower than 19 m, but a progressive decline occurred in both maximal size reached and average growth rates with increasing depth after this point. Food limitation may have been the mechanism involved, which is likely to vary significantly for other locations depending on local environmental conditions. Average time to recruitment to the fishery (100 mm shell width) was three years for the shallower populations. A slight reduction in average size of adults at higher densities was found for some populations, indicating a possible density-dependent effect. Examination of a high density scallop bed found animals to display distinctive substratum preferences over small spatial scales,…

AB  - In marine wetlands, nitrogen fixation is a potentially important nutrient source for nitrogen-limited primary producers, but interactions between nitrogen fixers and different vascular plant species are not fully understood. Nitrogen fixation activity was compared in sediments vegetated by three plant species, Spartina foliosa, Salicornia virginica, and Salicornia bigelovii in the Kendall Frost Reserve salt marsh in Mission Bay (CA). This study addressed the effects of plant type, day and night conditions, and sediment depths on nitrogen fixation. Higher rates of nitrogen fixation were associated with S. foliosa than with either of the two Salicornia spp., which are known to compete more effectively than Spartina for exogenous nitrogen in the salt marsh environment. Rates of nitrogen fixation, determined by acetylene reduction, in sediments vegetated by S. virginica were low during the day (7.7 plus or minus 1.2 mu mol C sub(2)H sub(4) m super(-2) h super(-1)) but averaged 13 plus or minus 6.6 mu mol C sub(2)H sub(4) m super(-2) h super(-1) at night, with particularly high rates in samples from locations with visible cyanobacterial mats. The opposite diel pattern was found for sediments containing S. foliosa plants, in which average daytime and nighttime rates of nitrogen fixation were 62 plus or minus 23 and 21 plus or minus 15 mu mol C sub(2)H sub(4) m super(-2) h super(-1), respectively. For S. foliosa, nitrogenase activity of rinsed roots and different sediment sections (0-1, or 4-5 cm depths) were measured. Although nitrogen fixation rates in vegetated sediment samples were substantial, all but one of rinsed S. foliosa root samples (n = 12) and subsurface sediments at 4-5 cm depths failed to show nitrogen fixation activity after 2 h, suggesting that the most active nitrogen fixers in these systems likely reside in surface sediments. Further, nitrogenase activity in shaded and unshaded S. foliosa samples did not differ, suggesting that nitrogen fixers may not rapidly respond to changes in plant photosynthetic activity. Average nitrogen fixation rates in S. foliosa-vegetated samples from the Mission Bay salt marsh were on the same order as those of highly productive Atlantic coast marshes, and this microbially-mediated nitrogen source may be similarly substantial in other Mediterranean wetlands. Sediment abiotic variables seem to exert greater control upon nitrogen fixation activity than the effects of particular plant species. Nonetheless, dominant plant species may differ substantially in their reliance on nitrogen fixation as a nutrient source, with potentially important consequences for wetland conservation and restoration.

AB  - A 2400 year record of environmental change is reported from a wetland on Bentinck Island in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. Three phases of wetland development are identified, with a protected coastal setting from ca. 2400 to 500 years ago, transitioning into an estuarine mangrove forest from ca. 500 years ago to the 1940s, and finally to a freshwater swamp over the past +60 years. This sequence reflects the influence of falling sea-levels, development of a coastal dune barrier system, prograding shorelines, and an extreme storm (cyclone) event. In addition, there is clear evidence of the impacts that human abandonment and resettlement have on the island's fire regimes and vegetation. A dramatic increase in burning and vegetation thickening was observed after the cessation of traditional Indigenous Kaiadilt fire management practices in the 1940s, and was then reversed when people returned to the island in the 1980s. In terms of the longer context for human occupation of the South Wellesley Archipelago, it is apparent that the mangrove phase provided a stable and productive environment that was conducive for human settlement of this region over the past 1000 years.

AB  - The coastlines of the world's oceans encompass a tremendous variety of geomorphic and geologic structures. They range from rocky cliffs to sandy barrier beaches to low-lying swampy wetlands. The geomorphic forms were created by the interaction of antecedent geology, physical dynamic processes, and man-made intervention. Variable features are usually composed of unconsolidated materials that respond rapidly to changes in the dynamic environment. More stable features are usually associated with consolidated rock or occur in quiescent environments. The geologic history of shorelines can be inferred from a careful study of geomorphic structures, coupled with additional data on physical processes and historic events. Many of the study techniques are relatively simple, consisting of analysis of existing maps and historical sources. An understanding of the processes which have shaped the shore is crucial to the design of coastal structures and to the intelligent management of coastal resources and habitats. In addition, understanding of the form/process relationships between geomorphology and dynamics may allow coastal scientists to more accurately predict the results of construction or other modifications along the shore.

AB  - Salt marshes restored through managed coastal realignment (MR) often develop slowly and show persistent differences in vegetation from natural marshes. Development might be constrained by the availability of propagules or poor suitability of the abiotic environment for their establishment. To distinguish between these factors, we compared vegetation colonization and environmental conditions at a salt marsh created by MR at Brancaster, Norfolk, UK, with five reference marshes, varying in age from 30 to circa 6,000 years. After 5 years, plant communities of the MR site remained different from those in mature reference marshes. In contrast, the communities of the youngest reference marsh were not significantly different from mature reference marshes. At the MR site, abundance of perennial and later-successional species was low and large areas remained unvegetated. These differences are unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation, because 76% of the species from the local species pool colonized the site within 5 years. Although the annuals Salicornia europaea and Suaeda maritima were abundant by year 2, they were not ubiquitous until the end of the study. Tidal elevations of the MR site were suitable for vegetation development, but soil redox potentials were lower than that at the reference sites. Reducing conditions in the MR site appear to be the major cause of vegetation differences from the reference marshes, as they are associated with an abundance of bare ground and a small range of vegetation clusters. Measures to avoid low sediment redox potentials may have a great benefit in some salt marsh restoration projects.

AB  - In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, household adaptation to climatic variability hinges upon access to wetland resources. Household adaptation may be effective for current flood variability, but inadequate for future climate variability. Government interventions through adaptation planning for flood variability may also be inadequate. This study aimed to improve knowledge on adaptation planning in the Okavango Delta and similar areas in the world. The specific objectives were to determine household exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity to flood-related shocks, identify and assess government interventions for flood variability, and determine the effect of these interventions on household adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta. Informed by the institutional analysis and development framework, the study used data from a survey of 623 households in five villages, some qualitative methods and secondary data sources. The results indicate that households are inherently sensitive to shocks, due to their dependence on natural resource-based livelihood activities, and that most households had sick members (53 %), and were food insecure (74 %). More households were more affected by river desiccation (84 %) than by flooding (23 %). Adaptation planning was implicitly undertaken in the form of disaster risk reduction, and mainstream development and poverty reduction programmes. These effectively contributed to household adaptation to flood variability but inhibited local institutional learning and innovation. Moreover, they were neither participatory nor conformant to local norms and therefore not sustainable in the long term. There is a need to adopt explicit, flexible and participatory approaches to planning to promote autonomous adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta.

AB  - The Morro Bay estuary, located on the central Coast of California approximately half way between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is one of the most important wetlands on the west Coast as it supports wide variety of habitats including numerous sensitive and endangered plant and animal species. Various studies have identified accelerated erosion and subsequent sedimentation as a major threat for sustainability of the bay. Watershed disturbances caused by agricultural activities are believed to be one of the major causes of the accelerated erosion and sedimentation. More than 200 conservation practices have been installed in the watershed since the mid-1990 to reduce erosion and sedimentation. This paper will review the implemented BMPs and will evaluate effectiveness of the BMPs using observations and modeling exercise. Streamflow and sediment concentration, measured mainly during the rainy seasons, are available for multiple locations in the watershed. However, the observations are not sufficient in terms of spatial density and data length to evaluate effectiveness of the mitigation measures at various locations in the watershed. It would be daunting in terms of cost to develop an intensive network of monitoring sites that would be needed for reliable management of NPS pollutants. As a result, comprehensive watershed simulation models that integrate watershed and climate characteristics and can estimate pollutant quantity at various locations, and that can also identify source of the contaminants, is emerging as a key component of watershed management. In this regard, a comprehensive watershed simulation model for the Morro Bay watershed has been developed using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate both streamflow and sediment concentration. The observed data was used to improve prediction accuracy of the SWAT model through parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration steps. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using step-wise-regression analysis and Morris's one-at-a time (OAT) method. Calibration was performed using four different optimization methods: PEST, Genetic Algorithms, the Shuffled Complex Evolution Algorithm, and Dynamically Dimensioned Search. Relative performance of the sensitivity analysis methods and the calibration algorithms will be discussed in terms of effectiveness and computational efficiency. The developed model was used to evaluate effectiveness of the BMPs implemented in the Morro Bay watershed, and can also be used to prioritize sites where BMPs may be implemented in the future to further improve ecological integrity of the estuary.

AB  - Coastal dunes are Aeolian landforms that form at the interface of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems, mainly associated with dissipative coasts dominated by marine winds with an ample supply of well-sorted sands and occurring on ocean, lake, and estuary shorelines. Distributed worldwide, they comprise very diverse climates and biomes and present a large variety of forms and dimensions related with sediment supply and wind regime, where vegetation plays a relevant role. The influence of the sea determines a series of environmental and biological gradients from the shoreline and landwards. The harsh environment characterized by the scarcity of water and nutrients, substrate mobility and sand burial, incidence of salt spray and sand blasting, high air and soil temperatures and light intensities in low and medium latitudes, and saltwater flooding in the strandline determines the establishment of species of singular sand flora and fauna that are specifically adapted to such stressful conditions. Coastal dune systems have a recognized geomorpho-logical, geological, ecological, historical, archaeological, scenic, cultural, and socioeconomic interest and provide us with different direct and indirect benefits and resources including their role as natural barriers that buffer the effects of storms, sea, and wind. Nevertheless, they cover a really limited global area that is largely endangered at present, mainly due to human direct and indirect impacts. This has led to the development of initiatives and efforts focused on dune conservation, management, and restoration from different disciplines and government levels. © 2016, Springer Science and Business Media B.V..

AB  - Woody debris is ubiquitous in coastal waters, and on shorelines proximate to forested regions. Logs and driftwood play a vital role in coastal and global ecosystems, and can provide valuable data to support studies of oceanography, geomorphology, ecology, history and archaeology. There is growing interest in the role that woody debris can play in nature-based coastal engineering solutions. However, large quantities of woody debris in coastal waters can pose significant hazards to communities, infrastructure, navigation and ecosystems. Thus, the changing abundance and distribution of coastal driftwood, driven by factors including human activities and climate change, has potential for both positive and negative consequences. A better understanding of coastal driftwood fate and transport processes is needed to inform management practices, uses, and sustainable ecosystem management. To date, research on physical transport of woody debris, has been concentrated on tsunami and inland (riverine) environments, where spatiotemporal scales and driving processes are significantly different from typical climatic or even extreme (storm) conditions in coastal waters. In this paper, we describe a series of scale physical model experiments, conducted to provide insight to debris transport processes in coastal waters under a range of controlled wave and water level conditions. The experiments were conducted in a 50.4-metre by 29.4-metre wave basin, in which a 1/30 scale model of a natural shoreline comprised of a shallow fringing reef, a sandy shoreline, and several small coastal structures (groynes and breakwaters) was constructed. Wooden dowels and tree branches, scaled to replicate the size distribution of woody debris observed on Pacific Northwest shorelines, were released in the model. Despite some limitations (e.g., model scale effects), the experimental test results provided several valuable insights to factors affecting debris mobility in coastal areas. The results will inform the parameterization of important physical processes in a numerical model being developed to predict the fate and transport of woody debris in coastal waters.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/hvBHZVObDhY

AB  - California Marine Life Refuges (CMLR) are the principal form of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) designed to protect intertidal organisms. However, CMLR allow recreational fishing and, while placing restrictions on the collecting of most species of invertebrates and seaweeds, do not limit visitor access. The year-long study of eight sites in Orange County, California show that CMLR are ineffective in protecting coastal populations in regions of high visitor density. Knowledge of the current status and coastal ecosystems and the processes that affect them should be used to evaluate California's MPA system with the goal of designing effective refuges and sanctuaries for sustaining coastal populations.

AB  - The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) for polishing of petroleum refinery wastewater in Nigeria was evaluated. Secondary treated petroleum refinery wastewater from a refinery (Kaduna, Nigeria) was characterized with different types of organic and inorganic pollutants (Chapter 3). Vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) CWs planted with locally available macrophytes (Cyperus alternifolius and Cynodon dactylon) were designed and built for polishing of secondary treated refinery wastewater in terms of organic matter, nutrients and suspended solids removal (Chapter 4). The tertiary treated refinery wastewater did, however, not meet effluent discharged compliance limits in terms of total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium-N (NH4+-N) removal. Typha latifolia planted-VSSF CWs could, however, treat TSS, BOD5, COD and NH4+-N in the petroleum refinery wastewater to below World Health Organization and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (Nigeria) effluent discharge limits of 30 mg/L for TSS, 10 mg/L for BOD5, 40 mg/L for COD and 0.2 mg/L for NH4+-N (Chapter 5). T. latifolia-planted VSSF CW achieved higher removal efficiencies for all parameters measured in comparison to C. alternifolius and C. dactylon planted-VSSF CWs. In addition, the T. latifolia-planted VSSF CW had the best heavy metal removal performance, followed by the C. alternifolius-planted VSSF CW and then the C. dactylon-planted VSSF CW (Chapter 6). The accumulation of the heavy metals in the plants accounted for only a rather small fraction (0.09 - 16 %) of the overall heavy metal removal by the wetlands. Coupling a horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CW to the VSSF CW (hybrid CW) further improved effluent quality with an overall BOD5 and PO43--P removal efficiency of, respectively, 94% and 78% (Chapter 5). Diesel contaminated wastewater was treated in the hybrid CWs spiked with three different nutrient concentrations. Numerical experiments were performed to investigate the biodegradation of the diesel compounds in the synthetic contaminated wastewater by the duplex-CWs using constructed wetland 2D. The VF CWs had a higher removal efficiency than the HFF CWs and the hybrid CW showed higher removal efficiencies in the days with nutrient application than the days without nutrient application (Chapter 8). This study showed that VSSF CWs planted with T. latifolia, C. alternifolius and C. dactylon can be used for the removal of suspended solids, organic contaminants and heavy metals from secondary refinery wastewater under tropical climate conditions. Especially T. latifolia-planted hybrid CWs are viable alternatives for the treatment of secondary refinery wastewater to below standards of the World Health Organization and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (Nigeria) under the prevailing climatic conditions in Nigeria.</p

AB  - This paper presents the navigation implications of a possible Mississippi River mouth re-alignment plan from the perspective of one of the teams selected to compete in the changing course design competition (see changingcourse. us and deltaforall. com for more information). The goals of the competition are to: Create a sustainable and functioning deltaic system in areas adjacent to the Mississippi River and below New Orleans; Continue to meet the needs of navigation, flood protection and coastal industries and communities; Contribute additional innovation, competition, and private sector engagement in time to inform Louisiana's next coastal Master Plan in 2017 in terms of a possible option for river mouth re-alignment. In this design competition, the primary challenges arise from the meeting of the natural and built environments and the tremendous changes underway. Navigation, shipping, fisheries, coastal industries, communities, and wetland health all face tremendous pressure from these changes. This paper presents a river mouth realignment alternative that would provide for a smaller but sustainable Delta footprint, at the same time as providing immediate opportunities for dramatic flood risk reduction and a massive upgrade to the navigation system.

AB  - <jats:p> The settlement of embankments and reclamations over soft soils is frequently accelerated by the use of vertical drains. The magnitude of long-term settlement is sometimes reduced by the use of surcharge, although there is often uncertainty about how long the surcharge should be maintained to minimise creep movement. The design of vertical drains is generally based on closed-form solutions of Terzaghi's consolidation equation, and rarely takes into account non-linear stiffness and creep of the soil. In this paper a one-dimensional finite difference consolidation analysis is outlined showing how vertical and radial drainage of a multi-layer soil profile in the zone of influence of a vertical drain may be modelled. The analysis allows inclusion of a zone of peripheral smear around the drain and drain resistance, permeabilities may be varied with void ratio, and creep is modelled both during and after primary consolidation. The application of the model is illustrated with back-analysis of field data from construction of an embankment with temporary surcharge over estuarine alluvium. </jats:p>

AB  - Landscape destruction is much prevailing nowadays, with cities expanding coupled with an increasing global population. Accordingly, moving landscapes toward sustainability is needed more than ever before. Although urban and landscape planners have increasingly studied landscape sustainability, understanding the impact of nature-based solutions on landscape sustainability is still obscure. In order to fill this gap, this study provides a framework that identifies the contribution of nature-based solutions (NBS) in environmental, sociocultural, and economic indicators to urban landscape sustainability. The results of this research highlight that the implementation of NBS has the potential to make the urban landscapes more sustainable in the elements including water, soil, air, and vegetation and wildlife as environmental; health, security, education, place-based values, visual quality, and social relationship as sociocultural; and tourism, employment, energy, agriculture, and waste management and recycling as economic dimension.

The design includes restoration of historic estuarine marshland and alluvial floodplain features to achieve 100-year flood damage mitigation objectives for the city of Napa and to allow for continued navigation use. The design demonstrates the compatibility of ecologic restoration and flood damage mitigation objectives when they are given equal weight in the design process.

AB  - Bioturbating macrofauna can have major effects on their physical, biological and biogeochemical surroundings, altering ecosystem functioning. Austrohelice crassa (herein Austrohelice) is a burrow building estuarine crab endemic to New Zealand. The abundant and widespread nature of this species infers that its effects on sediment processes are likely to be significant. This thesis explores Austrohelice’s impact on ecosystem functioning quantifying both density and habitat induced differences in sediment reworking rates, solute and particle fluxes. The underpinning mechanisms by which changes are mediated are also examined. I hypothesised that organism behaviour, sediment type and interactions between both factors have the potential to mediate changes to ecosystem functioning. Sediment reworking rates were calculated from four parameters: burrow and crab density, burrow morphology, burrow permanency and burrow maintenance, measured across a sedimentary gradient. Burrows were over 18 times more stable in mud than sand equating to over an order of magnitude reduction in sediment reworking rates, shifting the primary bioturbational role from burrow builder in mud to sediment mixer (bulldozer) in sand. Burrow decay rates, combined with differences in burrow and crab densities, were primarily responsible for changes in reworking rates among sediment types. An in situ density manipulation experiment was conducted in a non-cohesive sand and a cohesive muddy-sand to test the hypothesis that the functional plasticity of Austrohelice among sediment types would be reflected in measures of solute exchange; a proxy for ecosystem functioning. In both habitats, Austrohelice regulated nutrient cycling, creating strong density driven effects on solute exchanges. Increasing crab density enhanced sediment O₂ demand and the flux of NH₄⁺ from the sediment, indicating much of the response was physiologically driven. Despite lowering microphyte standing stock through deposit feeding, Austrohelice also increased benthic primary production per unit of chlorophyll a. Important context-specific differences were also revealed, most notably for NH₄⁺ fluxes, which were higher where burrows and their associated microbial communities were most stable. Laboratory based flume experiments were conducted to test if increasing burrow density amplified sediment erodibility and if the different reworking rates (and hence functionality) between sediment types, would affect sediment stability. Context-specific effects on particle fluxes associated with burrow density were observed among sediment types. Increasing burrow density reduced erodibility in cohesive mud, whereas in non-cohesive sand erosion rates were unimodal, being greatest at low burrow densities. Increased trapping of bedload material alongside a reduction in flow velocity due to surficial pellets was attributed to the reduction in the mass of sediment eroded in sand at high burrow densities. In mud, the linear decrease in erodibility associated with increased burrow density was attributed to…

AB  - Although seed dispersal is assumed to be a major factor determining plant community development in restored wetlands, little research exists on density and species richness of seed available through dispersal in these systems. We measured composition and seed dispersal rates at a restored tidal freshwater marsh in Washington, DC, USA by collecting seed dispersing through water and wind. Seed dispersal by water was measured using two methods of seed collection: (1) stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat along an elevation gradient bracketing the tidal range and (2) a floating surface trawl net attached to a boat. To estimate wind dispersal rates, we collected seed from stationary traps composed of coconut fiber mat positioned above marsh vegetation. We also collected a small number of samples of debris deposited along high tide lines (drift lines) and feces of Canada Goose to explore their seed content. We used the seedling emergence method to determine seed density in all samples, which involved placing the fiber mats or sample material on top of potting soil in a greenhouse misting room and enumerating emerging seedlings. Seedlings from a total of 125 plant species emerged during this study (including 82 in river trawls, 89 in stationary water traps, 21 in drift lines, 39 in wind traps, and 10 in goose feces). The most abundant taxa included Bidens frondosa, Boehmeria cylindrica, Cyperus spp., Eclipta prostrata, and Ludwigia palustris. Total seedling density was significantly greater for the stationary water traps (212 plus or minus 30.6 seeds/m super(2)/month) than the equal-sized stationary wind traps (18 plus or minus 6.0 seeds/m super(2)/month). Lower-bound estimates of total species richness based on the non-parametric Chao 2 asymptotic estimators were greater for seeds in water (106 plus or minus 1.4 for stationary water traps and 104 plus or minus 5.5 for trawl samples) than for wind (54 plus or minus 6.4). Our results indicate that water is the primary source of seeds dispersing to the site and that a species-rich pool of dispersing propagules is present, an interesting result given the urbanized nature of the surrounding landscape. However, species composition of dispersing seeds differed from vegetation of restored and natural tidal freshwater marshes, indicating that planting is necessary for certain species. At other restoration sites, information on densities of dispersing seeds can support decisions on which species to plant.

AB  - <jats:p><p>Currently 40% of the world’s human population lives within 100km of a coast. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicting that sea levels will rise between 0.52 and 0.98m by 2100, and with increasing climate change induced extreme weather events affecting urban settings, the ways in which people reside in coastal areas needs to be addressed. As water levels rise, both permanently through sea level rise, and temporarily through storm surge events, areas of high population in low lying areas will have to reconsider their typical housing and infrastructure design methods, and/or their lifestyles to address this more frequent or potentially permanent influx of water into towns and cities.  Current methods of flood adaptive architecture often consider solutions at just the individual house or building scale, despite the clear need to be able to analyse and design with wider changing urban landscape conditions driving decision making. In response, this research investigates possible design strategies for adapting housing to climate change induced flooding, while enhancing the liveability of changing local community environments. This is investigated through a case study design-led research process, and is complimented by a survey of residents. The case study site is a flood prone suburb in the city of Dunedin on the east coast of the South Island in Aotearoa New Zealand.  Key findings of the research point to the importance of employing not just a purely technical approach to flooding adaptive housing, but also to using a community-led approach to re-design to understand how people will react to, use, and adapt to repurposed built environments that respond to climate change. This reinforces the need to conceive flood adaptive housing at least at a street and neighbourhood scale, and preferably at a whole suburb landscape scale, rather that just as a single housing typology solution. The research concludes that combining flood adaptive housing with ecosystem-based adaptation solutions to climate change induced flooding could lead to a different, more ecology-integrated way of living for inhabitants of low lying coastal areas. This in turn is likely to have positive social and psychological benefits for inhabitants while increasing community resilience.</p></jats:p>

AB  - Since 1982, Danish legislation on streams and drainage has included clauses which make it possible to implement river restoration. In this paper, the Danish shift in policy from drainage to the return of wetlands is described. To illustrate the new beginning on catchment management, two major river-restoration schemes, i.e. the River Brede demonstration project and the River Skjern Nature project, are presented. Both projects have been implemented and consist of many parts, including (a) returning the straight, regulated rivers back to their former meanders, (b) introducing better hydraulic interaction between the river and its meadows, and (c) establishing former lakes, bogs, ponds and marshes. Also, an increase in security against flooding has resulted, as the regulated 'water-motorways'have become more natural, with buffer-zones and retention of water in the restored features.

AB  - Eutrophication often causes hypoxia in estuarine and coastal systems, but the mechanisms that control hypoxic events vary among estuaries and are often difficult to discern. This study monitored surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Upper Newport Bay (UNB), a tidally-mixed estuary in southern California subject to anthropogenic nutrient loading, eutrophication and hypoxia. The goal of this study was to identify the environmental factors regulating DO dynamics. Six hypoxic events occurred between June and November and were associated with a combination of low solar radiation, increased freshwater discharge following precipitation, and enhanced haline stratification during reduced tidal range periods. At the head of the estuary, high macroalgal biomass and pronounced haline stratification resulted in high DO in the surface layer and low DO in the bottom layer. Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor waters were transported down-estuary by ebb tides, resulting in DO heterogeneity throughout the UNB.

AB  - The Abandoned Yellow River Delta (denoted as “AYRD” hereafter) located in the north of Jiangsu Coast, China, was formed and developed during the years 1128-1855, when the old Yellow River reached the Jiangsu Coast and discharged into the south Yellow sea. Since 1855, the Yellow River has shifted its course to the Bohai Sea. The subaqueous delta was eroded due to the cut off of the sediment supply. Now, the coast of the AYRD is exposed to the wave action of the South Yellow Sea due to the lack of shelter of offshore sandbars, so the wave-induced sediment lifting effect is strong, leading to the obvious sediment resuspension in the subaqueous delta under the wave action. Based on the field data, we analyzed the law of water and sediment movement and established a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport numerical model (Delft3D), coupled to the wave model to simulate the sediment transport. The results show that the suspended sediment concentration (denoted as “SSC” hereafter) is high nearshore and low offshore. During the flood tide, the sediment is transported to the south, and to the north in ebb tide, but the net transport direction is to the south, which is an important source of material in the central coast of Jiangsu. Due to the breakwater construction, the sediment transport from north to south has been intercepted, a small amount of siltation has occurred in the south and inside of the breakwater. which greatly reduces the SSC in the port area and the nearby estuaries but has little impact in the far estuaries. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - Sea-level rise threatens low-lying areas around the world's coasts with increased coastal flooding during storms. One response to this challenge is to build or upgrade coastal flood defenses. This report examines the potential investment costs of such an adaptation strategy applied globally over the 21st century for sea-level rise scenarios consistent with three Representative Concentration Pathways and 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. For all the protection models considered, much less than half of the world's coast is protected. The total defense costs are significantly higher than earlier estimates, amounting to as much as US$18.3 trillion. With cost-benefit analysis, there are large uncertainties and empirical observations of protection standards are limited. Hence, the estimates should be considered as indicative, and this remains an important topic for future research. Further, building defenses is not a one-off capital investment. Over the 21st century, the cost of a comprehensive protection strategy is dominated by maintenance costs in all the cases considered in this report. This indicates that in addition to capital investment, the development of appropriate institutions and governance mechanisms to deliver maintenance, as well as the necessary funding streams, are essential for such a protection-based adaptation strategy to be effective.

AB  - An intense low-pressure system passed along coasts of Pacific Ocean side of the northern part of Japan in October 2006. High tide level was recorded, many beaches and dunes were eroded and coastal defense systems were damaged on the coasts by the low-pressure system. This high water level due to the low-pressure system continued for over 24 hours with big wind waves and met astronomical high tide a few times. The results of numerical simulations shown in this paper confirm us that Ekman transport was the main physical force to generate this high tide level.

AB  - <jats:p><p>The movement of water along a vertical scale draws attention to the subtle realities of topography and the consequential horizontal extent of flooding. During a flood, the section gives rise to new configurations and understandings of the city. Today, flooding has become synonymous with the impact of global sea level rise, and the threat of rising waters has taken on a new sense of urgency. Studying the planar transformation that takes place during a time of high water is an opportunity to reinvent and redesign the 21st-century city, and to consider new notions of urban and ecological development. We are particularly interested in questioning both the notion and the effectiveness of “hard infrastructure,” exemplified by seawalls and storm surge barriers. These reduce the zone of floodwater absorption to a singular line in plan and a singular wall in section. We propose the development of a new strategic approach toward flooding that we call “soft infrastructure”— multiple and iterative strategies that buffer or absorb flooding. These strategies operate at the merged surface of the land’s topography and the water’s bathymetry, or in the shallow flats below the water. We envision the water’s edge as a fluid and temporal limit between the water and the land. Our analyses include computational hydrodynamic and hazard models to predict flooding and their consequences in the New York and New Jersey harbor region.</p></jats:p>

AB  - Bayside bulkheads on Great South Bay, New York at Fire Island National Seashore are evaluated to determine their impact on unprotected areas adjacent to them and to identify alternatives for future protection from coastal erosion. Bulkheads extend along about 18% of the 67.3 km-long shoreline. Annual topographic surveys conducted 2004-2008 at four bulkheads and two control sites reveal that annual retreat can be as great as 3.3 m yr-1 in the upland and 6 m yr super( -1) on the foreshore. Local bulkhead-influenced sand starvation appears to extend up to 68 m alongshore. Sand starvation due to bulkheads is only one aspect of the erosion problem. Lack of fresh inputs of sediment to the bayshore by inlets, overwash and dune migration all contribute to shoreline transgression. Beach nourishment can restore the sediment budget in places but should be introduced in a way that minimizes burial of benthic habitat or creation of large scale exotic environments. The inherent dynamism of natural systems and the adaptation of species to this dynamism prevent restoration of landforms or habitats to stable target states. The closest approximation of a "permanent" solution would be to restore the sediment budget by creating feeder uplands by placing fill sediment at about the height of local natural formations and close to bulkhead ends. Dredging of navigation channels appears to provide a ready source of compatible fill.

AB  - This paper deals with wave energy converters used to reduce the wave height along shorelines. For this study the Wave Dragon wave energy converter is chosen. The wave height reduction from a single device has been evaluated from physical model tests in scale 1:51.8 of the 260 x 150 m, 24 kW/m model. Different stiffness of the mooring system and reflector joints has been tested for different wave steepness and relative floating ratios. The influence of each of these parameters on the wave transmission is presented. Additionally, a numerical case study is performed for the Santander Bay in the northern Spain, to evaluate the potential for reducing wave heights close the shore by means of Wave Dragons.

AB  - Conference Title: 2015 International Conference on Data and Software Engineering (ICoDSE) Conference Start Date: 2015, Nov. 25 Conference End Date: 2015, Nov. 26 Conference Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia As the world faces an increasing number of both natural and social disasters, attempts to support disaster risk reduction are also increasing. Although there is a general rule to calculate the disaster risk on an area based on the components of hazard, vulnerability, and capacity, disaster risk studies result in a number of disaster risk models which present different characteristics in terms of the number of components involved, indicators, and the calculations. This poses a difficulty for disaster analysts to choose the most appropriate model to calculate the disaster risk of an area. Moreover, they often need to adapt the existing models or even to create new models in order to provide the most suitable way of calculating the disaster risks. Therefore, a mechanism that enables the use of different kinds of disaster risk model and the creation of new models is required. This paper presents a metamodel of disaster risk based on a study on a number of disaster risk models used in Indonesia: the BNPB (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana) disaster risk model, the volcanic disaster risk model using SMART (Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique) method, and the tidal flooding disaster risk model using fuzzy method. The metamodel is presented in an entity-relationship model. It is basically a spatial data model since the components and indicators for the calculation of disaster risks are always associated to the space on earth. The metamodel is implemented on top of ArcGIS software. Using Phyton Add-in, the software is adapted by adding new functionalities to calculate the disaster risk of an area and to create new disaster risk models.

AB  - The productivity of biological resources in coastal Louisiana is at risk because of Gulf shoreline changes. Most estuarine species depend on Gulf shores and barrier islands for nesting, food, or shelter and will be directly affected by habitat loss. Others have complex indirect relationships with the shoreline ecosystem. Forecasting the degree of impact on all animals that are indirectly affected by shoreline change cannot be done with any degree of certainty. However, it is possible to evaluate and attempt to quantify the effects of changes in environmental factors that drive the distribution and abundance of commercial, keystone, and endangered species. Our objective was to provide an overview of habitat associations and environmental concerns for these significant animal species. For example, many important commercial species in Louisiana - such as blue crabs, Gulf menhaden, and various shrimp species - move among coastal habitats to complete parts of their life cycles. If the movement of these animals from the Gulf through tidal passes into estuarine nursery habitats is altered by shoreline changes, then populations of these species will be put at risk. Likewise, populations of keystone species, such as the common Rangia clam and the American oyster, will be affected if shoreline loss leads to changes in salinity conditions. Finally, most of Louisiana's threatened and endangered coastal species - such as sea turtles, brown pelicans, piping plovers, and Gulf sturgeon - rely on vulnerable barrier island habitats. Information on estuarine invertebrates, fishes, and other coastal animals is provided so that restoration of essential habitats can be incorporated into coastal management activities.

AB  - This study describes a novel system of compressed air generation using a pendulum wave energy converter installed in a coastal defense structure. The objective of this study is to understand how much energy from the incoming waves can be captured for use by the system. Laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of wave and system load conditions on energy conversion efficiency and wave reflection. The test results show that the system can operate with a high degree of efficiency under standing wave and high-load conditions. A reduction of wave reflection can be achieved by the system under a wide range of wave conditions.

AB  - Summary Located in the western half of New Guinea, Papua is facing rapid and poorly-planned social and economic development, increasing habitat degradation and threatening its high level of species richness and endemicity. Freshwater ecosystems, more than any other biotope in Papua, face the worst consequences from human development through sedimentation, habitat alteration, pollution, and the introduction of exotic species. However, little research has been conducted on the impact of human activities on aquatic species, and specifically fish in lentic and lotic ecosystems, in Papua. Lake Sentani is located in northern Papua, near Jayapura, the capital of Papua Province. It is the largest lowland lake in Papua, and plays a critical role in the survival of the humans and organisms living in and around it. Human activities are negatively affecting its local flora and fauna, especially those with very narrow distributions, such as the rainbowfishes, Chilatherina sentaniensis and Glossolepis incisus, and the Sentani Goby (Glossogobius sp.). The lake is located close to an urban center and heavy development occurs in the north, east, and northeast, while other threats include non-point pollution of human activities, habitat alteration along the shoreline, and introduced species. Despite these concerns, and its proximity to the local government, the lake has received no attention in terms conserving its ecosystem. Moreover, although there is some research on the mollusks, phytoplankton, limnological aspects, and water quality of the lake, none exists specifically on the correlation between human activities and the lake’s inhabitants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document the ecology of the Red Rainbowfish (Glossolepis incisus), one of the threatened endemic fishes in Lake Sentani, and the impact of human activities on its habitats. Specifically, this study was designed to focus on the impact of human activities on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish, its body length, and sex ratio, and the abundance of introduced fishes and correlation between their abundance and Red Rainbowfish abundance. Assessing the impact of human activities was done by measuring eight water physicochemical parameters that were reported to have the most potential influence on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish, in nine locations from three zones. The zones were predetermined based on visual assessments of the level of human activities, where higher numbers of people were assumed to have higher impacts on the environment. Zone I’s locations had heavy human activity, Zone II’s locations had medium human activity, and Zone III’s locations had the lowest human activity and was considered a “control area”. These zones’ locations were later regrouped following analyses of the water physicochemical parameters. Fish and water samples were collected along the shoreline, at depths of up to two meters. Fish were sampled in the morning at each sampling site of a single location, and replicated three times on alternate days, yielding 27 data sets for each zone, or 81 data sets for all three zones within a year, and a total 243 data sets in three years. Collected rainbowfish were differentiated by sex, counted, measured, and released. Water parameters were measured in the same sites in which fish sampling was conducted, three times a day—morning (06.00–09.00 am), midday (11.00 am–13.00 pm), and afternoon (16.00–18.00 pm)—and repeated three times in each sampling site on three alternate days. Thus, a total of 81 water parameter data sets were collected. Water parameters, including nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand were analyzed in a laboratory, while water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were directly measured in the field. Then, the ecology of the rainbowfish was descriptively analyzed to assess the preferred habitat of the fish, including substrate type, water depth, turbidity, and vegetation. The R statistical analysis program was used to analyze the water physicochemica parameters in order to determine the level of pollution in the water, abundance of Red Rainbowfish in each sampling group, and correlation between water physicochemical parameters and Red Rainbowfish abundance and body size. After the level of water pollution was determined, fish samples were arranged into three groups based on the level of pollution in their location. The Analysis Toolpak in Microsoft Excel 2007, and SPSS version 17.0 were used to calculate Red Rainbowfish body length for each group, as well as the difference between groups, correlation between Red Rainbowfish abundance and introduced fish abundance, and Red Rainbowfish abundance and nitrate concentration. Based on the aforementioned water physicochemical parameters, the sampling sites were distinguished into three groups: Groups 1 and 2 indicated heavy pollution (human impact) and Group 3 indicated low pollution (human impact) with fairly good water quality. There were significant differences in certain physicochemical parameters between groups, specifically in nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, BOD, and COD. Group 1 had the highest concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, while Group 2 had the highest concentrations of phosphate, BOD and COD. Group 3 had the best water quality of the three groups, with low to medium concentrations of each parameter. Phosphate levels in all three groups exceeded the Indonesian government’s phosphate limit in drinking water and fisheries, with BOD and COD. Nitrate and nitrite were both still within the limit. No area with zero human impact was found, even in sites with a population as low as two people. These results indicate that Lake Sentani already suffers from a high level of organic matter, which enters the lake as the result of human activities around it. Red Rainbowfish abundance was not different between groups, except when fish were counted based on their sex. Male abundance remained similar across groups, whereas female abundance was similar in Groups 1 and 2, but much lower in Group 3. Nitrate was the only water parameter significantly correlating negatively with Red Rainbowfish abundance, suggesting that increased nitrate levels had an effect in decreasing fish abundance in Lake Sentani, although the impact was still low. Red Rainbowfish body length was significantly different between groups, with Group 3 having the longest mean body length. Phosphate was the only parameter found to contribute to Red Rainbowfish body length, albeit non-significantly. Introduced fish abundance correlated weakly with Red Rainbowfish abundance. While Group 2 showed a weak negative correlation, Group 1 and Group 3 revealed a weak positive correlation, suggesting that, whether positive or negative, introduced fish species had a very low influence on the abundance of the Red Rainbowfish. Male Red Rainbowfish were more abundant than females in the shallow waters along the shoreline, the latter being found more commonly in deeper waters. This ratio was similar in Groups 1 and 2, whereas Group 3, whose habitats were the least polluted, had a higher ratio of males. The disparity in sex ratio was possibly caused by their different habitat preferences, as well as light and temperature preferences. The overall habitat preference of the Red Rainbowfish was clear, shallow water, sand, gravel, and cobble substrate, and shoaling amidst Hydrilla verticillata, Valisneria americana, Eichhornia crassipes, Metroxylon sagu, and grasses. The availability of food also attracted fish to certain areas, such as under traditional stilt houses, roots of some plants, litter, and wood debris. The pollen of terrestrial plants, as well as terrestrial insects, also served as a food source for the fish, along with the larvae of aquatic insects and algae. Roots of plants were also important for refuge, and as nursery and playing grounds. Moreover, the fish avoided high light intensities by moving to shaded areas or deeper water. These factors influenced the Red Rainbowfish’s distribution and habitat selection, and consequently, its abundance. Human activities in a around Lake Sentani have impacted the quality of its habitats and water. Although water quality did not have a significant influence on the Red Rainbowfish, owing to its ability to adapt to changes in water quality, changes to its habitat will have a significant impact on its ability to survive in Lake Sentani. The outcome of the present rate of pollution of its water will be further and more serious deterioration of its ecosystem, force its inhabitants to compete for increasingly fewer resources, and ultimately result in the extinction of its endemic species, of which the Red Rainbowfish is just one example. Therefore, Lake Sentani should be made a priority in Papuan conservation and management efforts, especially for native and endemic species. The results of this study provide baseline data for Red Rainbowfish conservation in Lake Sentani, and will allow policy-makers to pursue the protection of its habitats, create a strategy to control pollutants, and encourage community-based environmental management. Further research is needed on the correlation between the Red Rainbowfish and its preferences, and its susceptibility to certain types and concentrations of pollutants. Different strategies of pollution control should also be investigated. Other parts of Lake Sentani that were beyond the scope of this research should also be surveyed, along with a lake-wide program examining the exact condition of Lake Sentani’s ecosystem, whether it be the quality of its water or the response of its flora and fauna to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance, after which a more comprehensive rehabilitation program may follow.

AB  - The history of the coastal engineering activity in Portugal since 1964, the date of the last ICCE to be held in Lisbon, is briefly summarized. A difficult task indeed due to the time span of 40 years to be dealt with. The characterization of the country economical evolution, concerning coastal activities, is first tried by means of a set of growth indicators. The advances in the knowledge of some basic aspects, such as wave climate and littoral sediment transport in Portuguese coasts, are highlighted. The developments on coastal erosion, coastal protection and on the construction of coastal structures (breakwaters) are exemplified by means of some relevant case studies. The development of the scientific infrastructure is also very briefly presented.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2015 - Genova Conference Start Date: 2015, May 18 Conference End Date: 2015, May 21 Conference Location: Genova, Italy The objective of the present work is to evaluate the down wave conditions and the coastal impact induced by a hybrid wave-wind farm that would operate close to the Sardinia Island in the Mediterranean Sea. The target area was selected in the vicinity of Porto Ferro, which is located in the northern part of the island. Considering the most relevant environmental patterns, SWAN model simulations have been performed in order to assess the possible impact of the marine power plant. As regards the hybrid farm considered, it can be mentioned that this is located in the center of the target area and it is developed around some WindFloat offshore wind turbines. Such kind of floating wind turbines are already operational, both in the North Sea and in the Iberian nearshore. For the present study, a number of 11 floating platforms were considered, the spatial configuration of the farm being designed according to the standard prescriptions of the wind turbine manufacturer. Furthermore, a generic wave farm was considered to be implemented over a distance of 3.5 km at about 500 m up wave the wind farm. The most important conclusion coming from the present work is that the future marine power plants, besides extracting renewable energy, can play also an active role in coastal protection.

AB  - Excavation of sulfidic materials during construction has resulted in acid rock drainage (ARD) problems on disturbed lands throughout much of Virginia. In particular, exposure of sulfide-bearing Tertiary marine sediments in the Coastal Plain has become increasingly prevalent. Once exposed, these sediments rapidly produce acid sulfate soils which do not readily support vegetation. To date, the most extensive case of acid sulfate weathering problems in the Coastal Plain occurs at Stafford Regional Airport (SRAP) in Stafford, Virginia. Field plots were established at SRAP in 2002 to evaluate a variety of amendments for remediation and revegetation of acid sulfate soils. The plots were constructed in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 4 replications per treatment. Prior to treatment, surface (0-15cm) soil samples were collected from all plots to determine pH and peroxide potential acidity (PPA). Treatments included two rates of lime-stabilized biosolids (184 and 92 Mg ha -1) with small amounts of additional lime to achieve calcium carbonate equivalences (CCE) of 53 and 27 Mg ha -1, two rates of lime (47 and 23 Mg ha -1 CCE) with N, P, and K fertilizers, yardwaste compost (101 Mg ha -1) with lime (24 Mg ha -1CCE) and P and K fertilizers, and a control. The plots were seeded with a mix of acid- and salt-tolerant grasses. Soil and vegetation samples were collected in duplicate from each plot after 1 and 2 years. No significant differences were observed among the amended treatments for surface soil pH, surface soil EC, or vegetation production for either of the sampling dates, indicating that all of the tested amendment combinations were effective in stabilizing these materials.

AB  - Recently reported increased water depths and greater wave heights, perhaps associated with increased storminess, are likely to lead to more active changes, such as increased beach erosion, faster shoreline migration and sediment redistribution. A coastal environment particularly sensitive to the impact of sea-level rise is that of highly erodible cliffs and scarps. As structures are often built close to such formations, it is important to determine the retreat rate of cliffs and scarps. Among other things, knowing the retreat rate can help regulators plan coastal protection measures and can help property owners decide where to place their structures to avoid damage. The principal objective of the current study is to find and analyze the retreat rate of cliffs and scarps in several locations along the Estonian coast. Variable geological conditions, exposure to the sea and human influence are considered. The study was carried out in five different locations along the Estonian coast representing different geological properties, variable human influence and hydrodynamic conditions. Aerial photographs, orthophotos, RTK-GPS, leveling survey and archive data was used to measure the changes on the edges of the scarps and cliffs. It was found that the fastest rate of retreat appears on the location where the softest sediments are exposed to the roughest wave conditions - in Cape Kiipsaare. Here the yearly scarp-line retreat reached over 7 m/y (17 m3/y per meter of shoreline) which is faster than the fastest retreat rate of soft cliffs recorded anywhere else, but still two times lower in terms of the eroded volume of sediments. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges in current environmental policy. Appropriate policies intended to stimulate efficient adaptation and mitigation should not exclusively rely on the assumption of the homo oeconomicus, but take advantage of well-researched alternative behavioural patterns. Prospect theory provides a number of climate-relevant insights, such as the notion that evaluations of outcomes are reference dependent, and the relevance of perceived certainty of outcomes. This paper systematically reviews what prospect theory can offer to analyse mitigation and adaptation. It is shown that accounting for reference dependence and certainty effects contributes to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including (but not limited to) the different uptake of mitigation and adaptation amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation. Finally, concrete possibilities for empirical research on these effects are proposed.

AB  - Even though bioengineering technique has been regarded as one way to alleviate landslide and erosion problems, this process of revegetation is severely time consuming as the process of plant succession of the slopes may take decades or even hundreds of years. Approach: However, the process can be tremendously hastened by planting the right suitable pioneer species on the slopes. In this project, a natural succession experiment was conducted to determine the role of a potential slope colonizer, L. leucocephala, as a good pioneer in two years of observation. Results: In terms of the plant community, L. leucocephala had tremendously accelerated the plant succession of the slope. Within two years, 46 species comprising various species of grasses, shrubs and small trees colonized in the mixed culture treatment. The plant diversity increased drastically, about five (12 months) and eight fold (24 months) of its initial (0 month) diversity against 2.5 (12 months) and three fold (24 months) in the monoculture treatment. Related to this species-richness, LAI and biomass of the plant community was also enhanced in the mix-culture system. Conclusion: The results indicate that the species studied exhibits an outstanding pioneering characteristic by enhancing natural succession and the revegetation process which will be in turn, resulting in a more stable ecosystem. © 2009 Science Publications.

AB  - Section coastal hydrosedimentary dynamics and human impacts. The lagoon of Ghar El Melh and its annex, the lagoon of Sidi Ali El Mekki, belong to the coast of the Gulf of Tunis and are the remains of the old bay of Utica which represented an open Coastal Bay in the Mediterranean Sea in the 2nd century A.D (JAUZEIN, 1971; SLIM et al., 2004). Their barrier beach, or lido, is today facing major problems. The starting point was the creation in 1974 of a small fishing harbor which has deregulated the sediment dynamics along the shore. The morphology of the lido has been heavily modified and disturbances took place in the hydrological dynamics. The effects were also felt in the agricultural activity conducted on the banks of the lagoon system, including Ramli terroir resulting from an original soil use and which is of great importance to the agricultural heritage and the local patrimony. This technique consists to create farmland by a form of polders gained at the expanse of the lagoon and its wetlands. Plants are irrigated from their roots thanks to the movements, following tides, of a freshwater lens that forms in the artificial soil. The question is all the more important as the lagoon system is threatened by maritimisation and the changes in the lido morphology are accompanied by social problems and also by the lack of clear efforts that can save this land and ensure its sustainability.Alternate abstract:Section Fonctionnement hydrosédimentaire et impacts anthropiques. La lagune de Ghar El Melh et son annexe, la lagune de Sidi Ali El Mekki, appartiennent au littoral du golfe de Tunis et constituent les vestiges de l'ancienne baie d'Utique encore ouverte sur la mer au IIe siècle après J.-C. (JAUZEIN, 1971 ; SLIM et al., 2004). Le cordon littoral, ou lido, qui les isole aujourd'hui est confronté à d'importants problèmes. Le point de départ a été la création, en 1974, d'un petit port de pêche qui a déréglé la dynamique sédimentaire le long du rivage. La morphologie du lido a été fortement modifiée et des perturbations ont eu lieu au niveau de la dynamique hydrologique. Les conséquences ont été ressenties également dans l’activité agricole menée sur les berges du système lagunaire, notamment la culture dite Ramli à l'origine d'un terroir unique et d'un grand intérêt patrimonial. Il s'agit d’un terroir basé sur une technique qui consiste à gagner des terres agricoles par une forme de poldérisation et où les plantes sont irriguées, depuis leurs racines, suite au mouvement, en rapport avec la marée, d'une lentille d’eau douce qui se forme dans le sol artificiel. La question est d'autant plus importante que le système lagunaire est menacé de maritimisation, que les modifications dans la morphologie du lido s'accompagnent de problèmes d'ordre social et que les efforts pouvant sauver ce terroir et garantir sa pérennité ne sont pas visibles.

AB  - This study was a collaborating project between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, and the Prince George's County, Maryland. The project was performed under a contract with Advanced Technology Systems, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as part of the environmental restoration to the Patuxent watershed. The primary objective of this project was to create wetland features in the Willow Hills Storm Water Management pond without adversely impacting its flood control capability. Specifically, the study was to incorporate a sedimentation forebay and through flow shallow marsh wetland in the pond. The study approach was to provide the surface area required for the modifications and still preserve the total available storage. The proposed retrofit has five zones: a sedimentation zone, reed bed zone, littoral zone, open water zone, and riparian zone. The designed modifications include regrading the sides from about 2.5:1 to 2:1 slopes, excavating a portion of the base and filling other parts of the base to accommodate the different zones. The total excavation and filling were designed to be equal to maintain the total capacity of the pond. A TR-20 modeling was conducted to check the project performance, as related to the peak flows for 2-, 5-, and 100-year floods. The modified pond would cause the peak flow for the 2-year storm to be reduced by 8.4%, and the reduction becomes smaller for the higher flood events. A detailed cost estimate, using MCACES, was developed for the proposed modifications.

AB  - <jats:p>Mangroves have a lot of economic and ecological advantages which include coastal protection, habitat for wildlife, fisheries and forestry products. Determination of the extent of mangrove patches in the coastal areas of the Philippines is therefore important especially in resource conservation, protection and management. This starts with a well-defined and accurate map. LiDARwas used in the mangrove extraction in the different coastal areas of Negros Occidental in Western Visayas, Philippines. Total coastal study area is 1,082.55 km² for the 14 municipalities/ cities processed. Derivatives that were used in the extraction include, DSM, DTM, Hillshade, Intensity, Number of Returns and PCA. The RGB bands of the Orthographic photographs taken at the same time with the LiDAR data were also used as one of the layers during the processing. NDVI, GRVI and Hillshade using Canny Edge Layer were derived as well to produce an enhanced segmentation. Training and Validation points were collected through field validation and visual inspection using Stratified Random Sampling. The points were then used to feed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on tall structures. Only four classes were used, namely, Built-up, Mangroves, Other Trees and Sugarcane. Buffering and contextual editing were incorporated to reclassify the extracted mangroves. Overall accuracy assessment is at 98.73% (KIA of 98.24%) while overall accuracy assessment for Mangroves only is at 98.00%. Using this workflow, mangroves can already be extracted in a large-scale level with acceptable overall accuracy assessments.</jats:p>

AB  - Depositional units preserved on coastal plains worldwide are an important repository of information about large-scale climate change that has occurred during more than 20 Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. In general, the lateral and vertical complexity of these depositional units and their response to climatic and sea-level change are poorly understood, making it difficult to place historical and anticipated future climate and sea-level change in a natural geologic context. Mapping Quaternary siliciclastic depositional units on low-relief coastal plains historically has been based on aerial photographs. Accuracy and detail have been hindered, however, by lack of exposure and low relief. High-resolution airborne lidar surveys, along with surface and borehole geophysical measurements, are being used to identify lateral and vertical boundaries of stratigraphic units on the Texas Coastal Plain within upper Quaternary strata. Ground and borehole conductivity measurements discriminate sandy barrier island and fluvial and deltaic channel deposits from muddy floodplain, delta-plain, and estuarine deposits. Borehole conductivity and natural gamma logs similarly distinguish distinct depositional units in the subsurface and identify erosional unconformities and soil horizons that likely separate units deposited during different glacialinterglacial cycles. High-resolution digital elevation models obtained from airborne lidar surveys reveal previously unrecognized topographic detail that greatly aids mapping of subtle surface features such as sandy channels, interchannel deposits, and accretionary features on barrier islands that formed during the last interglacial period. An optimal mapping approach for coastal-plain environments employs (1) an initial lidar survey to produce a detailed elevation model; (2) selective surface sampling and geophysical measurements based on preliminary mapping derived from lidar data and aerial imagery; and (3) borehole sampling, logging, and analysis at key sites selected after lidar and surface measurements are complete.

AB  - Metal contamination of estuaries is a severe environmental problem, for which phytoremediation is gaining momentum. In particular, the associations between halophytes-autochthonous rhizobacteria have proven useful for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes. In this work, three bacterial strains (gram-negative and gram-positive) were used for Spartina densiflora inoculation. All three bacteria, particularly Pantoea strains, promoted plant growth and mitigated metal stress on polluted sediments, as revealed from functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus (PSII) and maintenance of nutrient balance. Pantoea strains did not significantly affect metal accumulation in plant roots, whereas the Bacillus strain enhanced it. Metal loading to shoots depended on particular elements, although in all cases it fell below the threshold for animal consumption. Our results confirm the possibility of modulating plant growth and metal accumulation upon selective inoculation, and the suitability of halophyte-rhizobacteria interactions as biotechnological tools for metal phytostabilization in salt marshes, preventing metal transfer to the food chain.

AB  - Nearly half a million miles of pipeline transporting natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids crisscross the United States. While an efficient and fundamentally safe means of transport, many pipelines carry materials with the potential to cause public injury and environmental damage. The nation's pipeline networks are also widespread and vulnerable to accidents and terrorist attack. Recent pipeline accidents in Marshall, MI, San Bruno, CA, Allentown, PA, and Laurel, MT, have heightened congressional concern about pipeline risks and drawn criticism from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Both government and industry have taken numerous steps to improve pipeline safety and security over the last 10 years. Nonetheless, while many stakeholders agree that federal pipeline safety programs have been on the right track, the spate of recent pipeline incidents suggest there continues to be significant room for improvement. Likewise, the threat of terrorist attacks, especially cyberattacks on pipeline control systems, remains a concern. The federal pipeline safety program is authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112- 90), which was signed by President Obama on January 3, 2012. The act contains a broad range of provisions addressing pipeline safety and security. Among the most significant are provisions that could increase the number of federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves for transmission pipelines, mandate verification of maximum allowable operating pressure for gas transmission pipelines, increase civil penalties for pipeline safety violations, and mandate reviews of diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. Both government and industry have taken numerous steps to improve pipeline safety and security over the last 10 years. Nonetheless, the NTSB has identified improvement of federal pipeline safety oversight as a top ten priority for 2013. The leading pipeline industry associations have concurred. Whether renewed efforts by industry, combined with additional oversight by federal agencies, will further enhance the safety and security of U.S. pipelines remains to be seen. As Congress oversees the federal pipeline safety program and the federal role in pipeline security, key issues of focus may be pipeline agency staff resources, automatic pipeline shutoff valves, penalties for safety violations, safety regulations for oil sands crudes, and the possible need for pipeline security regulations, among other concerns. In addition to these specific issues, Congress may assess how the various elements of U.S. pipeline safety and security activity fit together in the nation's overall strategy to protect transportation infrastructure. Pipeline safety and security necessarily involve many groups: federal agencies, oil and gas pipeline associations, large and small pipeline operators, and local communities. Reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Florida has an intense climate with periods of frequent and heavy rainfall and highly permeable sand soils which have little ability to retain nutrients or water. These factors provide cultural and environmental management challenges for landscape management. Urbanization and land use changes near coastal areas have been shown to degrade water quality. In an effort to reduce fertilizer-based nutrient pollution from urban areas, various programs are promoting alternative landscape materials, which require less input than traditional turfgrass vegetation. Although landscapes that utilize various plant materials that require traditional inputs may conceivably reduce nutrient pollution from urban landscapes, this idea remains unresolved. Here we use a replicated field experiment to show that P and K pollution via leaching was greater on a mixed-species ornamental landscape than a turfgrass monoculture during establishment and routine plant maintenance. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The delta of the Mississippi River is in jeopardy. It is rapidly subsiding into the Gulf of Mexico. Delta marshland is being drowned and the shoreline is moving northward toward New Orleans. The cause of these problems is the levee system along the Mississippi River, which prevents the replenishment of sediment to the delta. One way to restore the delta is through the use of one or more controlled partial avulsions of the Mississippi River. The design of such diversions represents a monumental task. A natural example of an avulsion in the Mississippi Delta, however, offers an excellent opportunity to test the concept of land building via river diversions. The Atchafalaya River is a distributary of the Mississippi River. During the flood of 1973, part of the Atchafalaya River avulsed into a man-made channel. The Wax Lake Delta at the mouth of the channel has been building seaward since then. Here a morphodynamic model of the Wax Lake Delta is presented and tested against field data. While the model is preliminary, the fact that it captures the process of land building at the Wax Lake Delta suggests that it can be adapted to the design of a major controlled partial avulsion of the Mississippi River into, for example, Barataria Bay. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Accurate and reliable benthic quality indicators are in great demand following the recent developments and the strict time schedule for implementing the European Water Framework Directive. The Mondego estuary has experienced a progressive deterioration during the 1990s, followed by a partial ecological recovery due to restoration measures in 1997/1998. The authors have used the estuary as a model system to test the performance and robustness of a set of ecological indicators in highlighting the changes in the ecological state of intertidal areas. Over a period of 17 years (1985-2002), they calculated Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, Taxonomic Distinctness measures, AZTI's Marine Biotic Index, Infaunal Trophic Index, and Eco-Exergy based indices and tested differences across periods characterised by different anthropogenic disturbance. Temporal data were combined within three periods: before, during and after disturbance, based on progressive information on the changes in the extended type of anthropogenic disturbance. Indices were then compared with biological and abiotic descriptors (macroalgae, macrophytes, benthic macrofauna, nutrients concentration, sediment grain size and total organic carbon). The authors found great disparity in the indicators ability to capture temporal changes, showing distinct performances at each site. At the Zostera noltii site, only Margalef, Total Taxonomic Distinctness and the thermodynamically based indices captured temporal changes, despite giving higher values during the disturbance period. At the bare sediment site, Taxonomic Distinctness, ITI, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, AMBI and the TBI were able to distinguish between periods, in agreement with the differences observed analysing the macrobenthic assemblages. Furthermore, Taxonomic Distinctness was not robust enough to detect any temporal or spatial change. The authors thus suggest further research to understand the behaviour of ecological indicators, in view of their crucial importance for the management and protection of marine coastal areas.

Relative contribution of wave setup to the storm surge: observations and modeling based analysis in open and protected environments (Truc Vert beach and Tubuai island). In: Shim, J.-S.; Chun, I., and Lim, H.S. (eds.), Proceedings from the International Coastal Symposium (ICS) 2018 (Busan, Republic of Korea). Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 85, pp. 1046–1050. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Recent events like the Xynthia (2010, France) storm illustrate the potentially devastating effect that storm surges can have on the coasts. Nearshore storm surges at the result mainly from two processes: atmospheric surges and wave setup. This paper investigate the relative wave setup contribution in the storm surge signal for energetic events and focusing on two cases: an open beach (Truc Vert beach, France) and a high island protected by a reef lagoon (Tubuai, French Polynesia). The two selected events are the Johanna storm (March'08), for the Truc Vert site, and the Oli cyclone (February'10), for Tubuai. The data analysis shows that the maximum total storm surge reaches 1.2 m on the Truc Vert site and 1.1 m in the Tubuai lagoon. On the Truc Vert beach, the ECORS'08 in-situ measurements allow estimating a wave setup contribution of 80% of the total storm surge, at the time of maximum storm surge. The relative contribution of the wave setup is investigated a bit further, using the modeling approach. The modeling relies on the joint use of a shallow-water (MARS 2DH) and wave (SWAN) models. It shows an heterogeneous distribution of the wave setup in the Tubuai lagoon and a longshore variability close to the waterline for Truc Vert (~ 30%). In both cases, the wave setup contribution to the whole storm surge is predominant, with relative values ranging from 71 to 120% of the total maximal storm surge. Values larger than 100% occur on the Tubuai site when the atmospheric storm surge is negative.

AB  - Eight strains of obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, chitinolytic bacteria were isolated from the sediment of an estuarine environment. The isolates were rod-shaped, Gram-negative, and formed terminal spherical spores that swelled the sporangium. The major products from the fermentation of chitin were: acetate, ethanol, formate, CO2, H2 and ammonia. Growth of the isolates was possible at pH values ranging from 5.0-9.0. During the fermentation of chitin, N-acetylglucosamine accumulated in the culture fluids and was not metabolized. No organic compounds other than chitin and its oligomers could be demonstrated to support growth of the isolates. Hydrolysis of chitin proceeded at a relatively low rate and was incomplete. Approximately 65% of the initial amount of chitin was hydrolyzed during a period of 5-10 days. Supplementation of the medium with yeast extract, casamino acids or peptone did not enhance the rate of chitin hydrolysis, but reducing agents such as Na2S2O4 and Ti (III)-NTA markedly stimulated the rate of chitin fermentation. The ecological implications of the high degree of substrate specialization are discussed. © 1986.

AB  - Conference Title: 2014 3rd International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA) Conference Start Date: 2014, June 11 Conference End Date: 2014, June 14 Conference Location: Changsha, China Forests play an important role in protecting the coastal environment by slowing down the wind speed and fixing the soil. With the aid of Remote Sensing technology, the monitoring and analysis of the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the coastal protection forests can provide useful and near real-time information for better forest construction and management in such areas. One major issue in previous studies was the somewhat subjective selection of the indicators when establishing the models for evaluating the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the protection forests, which made the research results less convincing and less reliable. Moreover, the analysis of the relationships between the indicators and effects of the evaluation models was also seldom reported. To overcome the aforementioned weakness of previous research, this present paper, taking Haitan Island, China, as study area, presented a new and detailed procedure for indicator selection for coastal protection forests' wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects evaluation and monitoring. Data used for the present study included: one Landsat 7 ETM+ image and one Landsat 8 OLI image, a DEM image with a spatial resolution of 5 meters and the meteorological data of the study area. According to a comprehensive literature survey, six most applicable indicators for the study area, namely, Climate Erosion Force (CE), Bare Sand Area Ratio (BS), Soil Adjust Vegetation Index (SAVI), Surface Roughness (SR), Soil Moisture (SM), and Soil Erodibility (SE) were selected. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Stepwise Regression Analysis (SRA) were applied to determine the weights for the six different indicators and to construct the evaluation model. By using the established evaluation model, the wind-preventing and sand-fixing effects of the coastal protection forests of the study area in 2002 and 2013 were computed, compared and analyzed.

AB  - The short-term effect of elevated water temperatures ( Delta t = 5-10 degree C after passing through the cooling circuit of an electricity generating plant) on plankton in a warm temperate estuary, South Africa, was investigated. Phytoplankton entrained on the flood tide was more severely affected than that entrained on the ebb, but chlorination of cooling water was probably a major factor affecting phytoplankton assemblages. Abundance of zooplankton of marine origin was significantly reduced after passing through the cooling circuit. The effect of thermal stress on the euryhaline zooplankton was not clear.

AB  - The York River has nine tidal wetland community types that are distributed along gradients of salinity and tidal inundation . These range from the Saltmarsh Cordgrass community dominated by Sparlina alterniflora to the Tidal Freshwater Mixed community that can have over 50 species in one marsh. These tidal marshes provide a number of important functions and values to the estuarine systems including: high primary productivity, important habitat value, erosion buffering and filtering capacity useful for trapping sediments, pollutants and nutrients. The tidal marsh communities within the four Chesapeake Bay Virginia National Estuarine Research Reserve sites are situated along the York system in polyhaline, mesohaline, oligohaline and freshwater salinity regimes. They are largely pristine vegetation communities and have been documented to have abundant fauna characteristic of their individual community types. Changes in the vegetation communities of each site have been documented over time; however more research is needed on the potential effects of projected sea level rise on these habitats and the roles of watershed sedimentation and nutrient enrichment, vegetation succession, and invasive species on the persistence and value of these tidal marsh areas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Extensive greenhouse studies using intact cores of marsh vegetation including Spartina alterniflora demonstrated the potential of a shoreline cleaner (Corexit 9580) to remove oil from plant canopy. Because of these positive results, a permit to conduct a full-scale field test was obtained by Louisiana State from regulatory agencies in June 1995. Field tests were conducted in a Louisiana marsh at a wildlife refuge in August 1995. The test site contained replicated 8 ft X 8 ft test plots that included the following treatments: oiled with South Louisiana crude oil, oiled and chemically cleaned after 2 days using Corexit 9580, and control. Significant initial reductions in plant stomatal conductance, transpiration, and CO2 fixation rates in response to the “oil” and “oil + Corexit 9580” treatments were noted, which were followed by substantial recovery in the “oil + Corexit 9580” treatment. Use of the cleaner improved the survival and regeneration capability of treated plots because of the low initia...

AB  - Natural resources along the shoreline of a tidal estuary were injured by oiling and physical disturbance following the accidental release of No. 6 fuel oil from a power plant in New Jersey, USA. Operation of heavy equipment on the shoreline during the emergency response entrained oil into sediments and physically damaged shoreline vegetation dominated by the low-value specie Phragmites australis. In response to this incident, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and the responsible party (RP) conducted a cooperative natural resource damage assessment (NRDA). During NRDA discussions, the NJDEP proposed that compensatory restoration for injured natural resources be provided at a ratio of 3:1 (restored-to-injured) based on the acreage of physically impacted vegetation. Since in-kind restoration of Phragmites was undesirable, native salt marsh vegetation was planted instead, resulting in enhancement of the injured habitat. Since the primary restoration actions yielded improvements beyond the baseline condition, the RP successfully negotiated a 1:1 replacement, ratio for components involving habitat enhancement. By incorporating habitat enhancement into the design of primary restoration, the amount of the compensatory restoration was reduced. By expanding the primary restoration to include enhancement of adjoining degraded habitat that was not impacted by the incident, the RP was able to satisfy both primary and compensatory restoration obligations simultaneously by integrating these components into a single restoration project. The combined primary and compensatory restoration project was then implemented as emergency restoration 4-5 months after the incident. This integrated restoration approach enabled the RP to: (1) decrease compensatory restoration requirements by incorporating habitat enhancement into primary restoration; (2) reduce restoration costs by avoiding separate primary and compensatory restoration projects; and (3) expedite restoration by performing actions under the scope of emergency restoration. This strategy benefited the trustees by simplifying, the assessment and reducing oversight burdens. The public and the environment benefited by receiving restoration on an accelerated timeframe.

AB  - Waychinicup Estuary (south-western Australia) is dominated by tidal and swell exchange with the ocean and receives seasonal, but low, freshwater inflows. The estuary was surveyed in September 1995 to determine the significance of freshwater inflows to its ecology and to provide a detailed inventory of benthic flora and fauna because, like other estuaries, Waychinicup may come under pressure for diversion of inflows to meet demand for potable water. Gradients detected in benthic flora and fauna, sediment grain size and organic content, and water quality, were related to distance from the river mouth. Sediments closest to the river mouth had a higher organic content and a higher percentage of 7 m). We hypothesise that biotic gradients in the estuary are determined by freshwater inflow, principally through its contribution of fine and organic sediments, and less so through its effect on salinity. These sediments are prone to resuspension, reducing water clarity, limiting plant growth and providing a niche for euryhaline, low light-adapted macroalgae and a polychaete-dominated infauna in the upper estuary. Change in sediment type, increase in water clarity and increasing salinity produces a shift to a diverse macroalgal and seagrass community, and an amphipod-dominated benthic fauna in the lower estuary. Despite the dominance of oceanic exchange in the estuary, freshwater inflow is a key determinant of the composition and distribution of biota. Any significant reduction in freshwater inflow is likely to cause a change in water quality and biota; the system would have lower organic inputs, become clearer, and the plant and animal assemblages currently found in the upper reaches of the estuary may well be lost.

AB  - Following industrial decline, much of the South Wales coastline is undergoing regeneration and water frontage is the development focus. The construction of the Millennium Park, Millennium Coastal Path and Earth Structure at Llanelli, South Wales, UK stimulated a commercial and domestic property redevelopment strategy. However, this took place without due consideration of coastal processes and location. Existing seawalls were undermined and required rock armour protection and their ability to protect recent developments is now in question. Causes and effects included inappropriate siting of infrastructure, advancing the line without due consideration of coastal processes and relocation of nearshore river channels. Lessons had not been learned following similar construction patterns elsewhere. Existing coastal defences and annual maintenance spending are both shown to be inadequate and inappropriate dredging practices are removing sediment from the system. This has serious repercussions for the coastal protection authority, not least as a result of threats to further development phases and legal repercussions.

AB  - This investigation was undertaken to determine whether the mosquito larvicide temephos (applied as Abate 4-E[reg.]) created an environmental hazard for nontarget organisms in a southwest Florida salt marsh community. Field toxicity tests were performed during routine larvicide applications using larvae of salt marsh crabs (Aratus pesonii and Uca rapax) and adult Mysidopsis bahia. Laboratory toxicity tests were performed using survival through 48 and 96 h and through first molt as toxicity endpoints. Larvae of both species exhibited 96 h lowest observable effects concentration (LOEC) in the range of 15 to 20 mu g/L temephos. First-molt LOEC ranged from 7 to 12 mu g/L. No effect on M. bahia survival, growth, or fecundity was observed up to 40 mu g/L temephos. Field studies of routine temephos application rates produced an expected environmental concentration (EEC) of 12 +/- 10 mu g/L in marsh water, causing an environmental hazard to crab larvae. Reduction of the application rate effectively reduced the EEC to 4 +/- 3 mu g/L, indicating no hazard for 48 and 96 h toxicity; however, a hazard was observed for survival through the first molt. This information was used to modify larviciding applications to effect a reduction of the environmental hazard to nontarget organisms in the salt marsh.

AB  - In September 1983, an underground pipeline break resulted in a 31,000-barrel crude oil spill into Little Panoche Creek, Fresno County, and California. The crude oil spill saturated soil and vegetation for two miles along the creek, Although the creek in itself is not of significant economic or environmental importance, the collective protection of creeks in the area is important. Water is a limiting re-source and wildlife habitats have been minimized due to agricultural development. The goal of the cleanup was to completely remove contaminated soil and vegetation so as to minimize direct damage to wildlife including the San Joaquin Kit Fox, a state-listed rare species and federally listed endangered species. Mitigation measures included the construction of small water ponding areas to enhance the growth of existing marsh vegetation, and seeding to revegetate the creek banks with indigenous shrubs to provide cover for wildlife and minimize soil erosion. Although a large volume of oil was spilled, conditions such as slow water flow in the creek, easy equipment access to the creek, and a natural oil collection area provided for favorable cleanup conditions and resulted in 99 percent recovery of oil. Contaminated soil was stockpiled to allow it to biodegrade, rather than use the costly alternative of landfill disposal. The creek habitat was near recovery one year after the spill. Recovery was assessed by the regrowth of marsh and shrub vegetation in the creek and its adjacent banks.

AB  - This paper describes the performance of test panels of riprap on an offshore island in the Wash estuary, UK, for the first 212 years after their construction, by which time all but one had failed. It outlines the methods used in obtaining and analysing data on stone size, wind, tides and waves. The techniques used in surveying the test panels for damage and the reduction of the survey data to yield quantitative estimates of damage are described. Comparisons are made between the damage to the riprap panels and what might have been estimated using laboratory data. Results do not support any scale effect causing riprap sized on laboratory data to be larger than necessary, and this conclusion is supported by the outcome of model tests carried out retrospectively by the Hydraulics Research Station (now HRS Ltd) at Wallingford, UK. Slope protection is sensitive not only to wave height and stone size but also to construction methods and, bearing in mind possible departures from the desired specification, a cautious approach to the design of riprap protection is advisable.

AB  - The restoration of Lake Renwick Heron Rookery habitat was discussed. The restoration project focused on creation of nesting opportunities, stabilization of eroding nesting island shorelines, and maintaining and improving access to and from the water for young flightless birds. A biotechnical shore protection detail incorporating a rock toe and soil bioengineering techniques was developed to stabilize the nesting island shorelines and supplement ground level nesting opportunities. Habitat improvements such as planting 500 tree and shrub seedlings, and placement of course woody debris and snags were also incorporated into the final design.

AB  - Sedges and grasses have a competitive advantage over cattails at higher elevations in Great Lakes wetlands where periodic low lake levels result in soils too dry to support cattails. Regulation of Lake Ontario water levels eliminated low lake-level years, resulting in cattail invasion. At a wetland scale at two Lake Ontario sites, we tested restoration methods by dredging channels through cattails, using spoil materials to create mounds suitable for sedge/grass growth, seeding mounds, and controlling cattails (T. x glauca) using methods adapted from experimental studies. Soil moisture and subsidence of mound soils were monitored. Vegetation was sampled pre-restoration and in shoreline sedge/grass meadow, emergent, and mound zones for two years following implementation. Although spoil mounds decreased in elevation at both sites, soil moisture increased more at the site with greater subsidence. Mean percent cover and ramet counts of cattails were reduced in sedge/grass and emergent zones at both sites. Mounds with greater soil moisture held more cattails post-construction. Across years at both sites, Carex lacustris and Calamagrostis canadensis increased in the sedge/grass meadow zone with reduction in Typha; Calamagrostis increased on the mounds. Key factors affecting results were cattail litter and, on the mounds, a second year of seeding with in situ cold, moist stratification, as well as soil moisture related to subsidence. Recommendations for future restorations include conducting more detailed soil surveys to assess potential subsidence, dredging wider and deeper channels to provide spoil for higher mounds, actively controlling invasive species, and conducting additional years of post-restoration data collection.

AB  - The Erika oil spill and the attendant cleaning operations it required have impacted almost every type of Breton shoreline, habitats and plant communities on shingle and sandy beaches, rocky cliffs, marshlands and dunes. The French Ministry of the Environment (Ministère de l'écologie et du développement durable) launched an impact assessment in 2000 on oil spill clean-up operations and the recovery of impacted vegetation via the «Réseau de suivi des conséquences écologiques et écotoxicologiques de la marée noire résultant du naufrage de l'Erika» (Monitoring network of the ecological and ecotoxicological consequences of the Erika oil spill). The Cedre and the Conservatoire Botanique National de Brest are dealing with the terrestrial vegetation program. Vegetation was surveyed in sixty locations where one hundred quadrates were recorded covering all vegetation types including all the degrees of oiling and the varying amounts of damage resulting from the removal of the HFO. A few examples of the oiled areas are discussed. The three year monitoring program shows a high degree of persistence of the HFO in uncleaned quadrates of a number of habitats. The FO 6 did no really serious damage in terms of mortality, vegetation cover and species composition. The survey illustrates how gentle manual oil removal techniques can enhance vegetation recovery within the space of a few years. It also exemplifies how some techniques have a very negative impact such as HWHP washing which only serves to delay recovery.

AB  - The unique landscape of Baratti Bay, its clear and sheltered waters and the proximity of the archaeological site all make Baratti one of the most popular bathing beaches in Tuscany. A multi-buoy mooring area was created on the southern side, additionally protected by a botched low-crest jetty, but this structure traps sand from the central beach, increasing erosion and reducing efficiency in mooring area functions. Shoreline stabilisation is necessary for the protection of this archaeological site and also to maintain and support local tourism. Whereas hard shore protection structures contrast with landscape protection, soft defence strategies may also be difficult to implement. Beach nourishment appears possibly as the best solution, but additional sediment fill without protection will increase siltation in the mooring area, and it is difficult to find sand of the same local petrographic composition. The project execution has recently been suspended and the ruins of the archaeological area are converting the beach into a narrow rubble strip.

AB  - The research on the effect of coastal facilities for protecting an estuary from channel blockage and a coast from beach erosion by waves demands to understand wave propagation, nearshore current and sediment transportation. The purpose of this research is to study theeffect of jetty and propose countermeasures to compensate insufficient safety in Chumphon estuary, Chumpon province. The field survey is executed, topographic maps, bathymetric data, wave data for storm surges, tidal data were collected and inputted in Ca's numerical model(Ca et. al., 2000). This model consists of the near shore fluid dynamicmodel based on the Boussinesq equation and the topographical change model which the bed load and the suspended load were considered. Although the jetties are very effective for channel maintenance, since diffraction waves by the jetties has drawn sand in the north-side beachof the jetties toward the jetties, serious coastal erosion has occurred in the center of this north-side beach. Moreover, according to thesimulation results by using Ca's model, in the south-side beach of thejetties, if a typhoon of Linda classes hits this area, since heavy overtopping occurs, wave dissipation facilities are necessary.

AB  - The research on the effect of coastal facilities for protecting an estuary from channel blockage and a coast from beach erosion by waves demands to understand wave propagation, a nearshore current and sediment transportation. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of jetties to the Chumphon estuary coast in Chumphon province, Thailand, and propose measures for erosion protecting in this coast. The long term prediction by a one-line model indicates the heavy erosion of around 1000 m northward from the jetties, the erosion around 250 m and 650 m southward from the jetties. As for the erosion of around 250 m southward, measures were examined in the last inter-national conference of ISOPE. As for the erosion of around 650 m southward, since there is no property which should be protected, it is ignored here. Therefore, about the heavy erosion of around 1000 m northward, measures are examined. In this study, since almost of all sand must be transported to jetties, sand nourishment is not a good measure. Detached breakwaters, artificial reefs, and non-measures are examined with the costs on the construction or the compensation, and the prevention effect of wave overtopping, short term erosion, and deterioration of a view. It makes clear that the most effective measure is non-measures (in other words, it is “set back”). Copyright © 2018 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE)

AB  - The project described in this paper includes development of surge ensemble modelling for the UK, and demonstration of probabilistic coastal flood forecasting for an area in the Irish Sea. Its purpose is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate probabilistic methods for surge, nearshore wave, and coastal flood forecasting in England and Wales, but the concepts and models would be equally applicable elsewhere. The main features that distinguish these methods from existing practice are in the use of hydraulic models extending through to action at coastal defences, and the use of ensemble and other probabilistic approaches throughout. Use of offshore forecasts to estimate the likelihood of high overtopping involves transformation of wave forecasts through the nearshore and surf zones, and the combined effects of wind, waves and sea level in causing overtopping. The model is outlined and site-specific measurements of waves and overtopping discharges are described and compared to the probabilistic predictions of the model.

AB  - Coastal dunes fringe the coast between Southport and Liverpool in northwest England, forming a natural barrier which prevents marine flooding of low-lying agricultural land in West Lancashire and north Merseyside. The dunes are best developed at Formby Point, where they reach 25 m above sea-level and blown sand extends some 4 km inland. This paper presents the results of an initial programme of field drilling, sediment analysis and radiocarbon dating which suggest that the dune complex developed from a large offshore sandbank, which was in existence by 6800 years ago. Behind the bank lay a large area of intertidal mudflats and sandflats with fringing saltmarsh. Dunes may have first become established on the emergent sand bank around 6000 years ago, but the oldest dunes for which there is direct dating evidence formed between 5700 and 5800 years ago. A period of dune stability, possibly associated with seaward progradation of beach and foredune ridges, appears to have occurred between 2500 years ago and the early Middle Ages. During the earlier part of this period oak and alder woodland covered the dunes and the sands were deeply podsolized. Historical and documentary evidence indicates that extensive sandblowing occurred all along the coast during the early Middle Ages, which was a period of exceptional storminess and rapid coastal erosion. Several settlements and farms were lost to the sea or were overwhelmed by blown sand as the coast eroded. Active sand tongues extended across the full width of the barrier and buried the backbarrier peats and silts along the western margin of Downholland Moss. Dune instability has continued intermittently until the present, although on a smaller scale, and consequently most of the present dune forms are relatively recent. Sand stabilization and foreshore reclamation measures undertaken in the second half of the nineteenth century were highly effective and contributed to a net seaward progradation of the entire Formby coastline between 1850 and 1900. Abandonment of these measures around the time of the First World War contributed to, but did not ultimately cause, a return to shoreline erosion and a new phase of frontal dune instability which is still in progress.

AB  - The coastal region of Bangladesh contributes to about one fifth of the country's landmass and one seventh of the total population. Once the region was diverse and rich in natural resources with huge forest vegetation, fishes, crops, poultry, livestock and wildlife, but at present, the whole region is at the verge of serious degradation due to human interventions and climate change. The study was carried out in Batiaghata upazila under Khulna district. Long term climatic data showed that there is an increasing trend of both maximum and minimum temperatures. On the other hand, although the annual rainfall has been increased in recent years but monthly distribution of rainfall is not even and it showed that the monsoon rainfall was increased by 56%, while dry season rainfall decreased by 60%. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns are accelerating flood, salinity and drought hazards, which are depleting both resources and environments. Increasing trend of cyclonic storms as well as tidal surges would be more and more vulnerable to climatic extremities in the coastal region. Due to intrusion of saline water for brackish water shrimp farming and increasing prolong drought, soil and water salinity have been increased remarkably, which adversely affecting both floral and faunal resources in the region. Increased soil and water salinity hampered soil fertility status and it was observed that around 27.36% soils organic matter has been depleted compared to base value of 1999. Suitable coping and adaptation measures should be taken immediately to restore the coastal ecosystem for sustaining agricultural production and development.

AB  - Brownlowia tersa is a low-ground semi-evergreen shrub species. The phenological events occur sequentially-leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering and fruiting from April to November. It is hermaphroditic, protandrous, self-compatible, facultative xenogamous, and melittophilous involving worker honey bees, small male and female carpenter bees and male and female cuckoo bees. Of these, worker honey bees and female carpenter bees forage for both pollen and nectar while male carpenter bees and both sexes of cuckoo bees forage exclusively for nectar. Cuckoo bees are very important for cross-pollination because they are swift fliers and visit many flowers from different plants in the shortest time. Carpenter bees and honey bees are largely important for self-pollination as they are not fast fliers and tend to spend more time at each flower for forage collection. The flowers have a specialized pollination mechanism to resort to autonomous autogamy if not pollinated but this mode of pollination is subject to the availability of pollen in its own anthers. Fruit is a 1-seeded follicle produced from a single carpel of the flower. It is indehiscent and floats in tidal water when detached from the plant. When settled in muddy substratum, it breaks open to expose the seed which germinates and produces a new plant in quick succession. The study reports that the plant is highly threatened due to different human economic activities taking place in the area and hence immediate in situ conservation measures are required for its protection and propagation. © Raju 2019.

AB  - This study is based on the data obtained from tests carried out in the Large Wave Flume (Grosser Wellenkanal (GWK)) in Hannover in the frame of a joint research project of Ghent University (Belgium) and Forschungszentrum Küste (FZK, Germany). The goal of the research project is to determine the wave induced loads on vertical storm walls located at the end of overtopped dike, which are designed to protect coastal cities from overtopping and floods. The loads resulting from waves overtopping the dike and impacting the vertical wall as a bore are measured by means of both force and pressure sensors. This paper describes the results of pressure and force records at the vertical wall, including a comparative analysis of the overall forces obtained by pressure integration and force sensors for two different wall setups: Fully blocked wall and partially blocked wall.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1896 - 1900. Szczecin, Poland, ISBN 0749-0208 This work illustrates the methodology developed to evaluate the risk of coastal flooding and its application to Vale do Lobo beach, located in the Loule Municipality, a Portuguese coastal area under significant touristic pressure. The methodology is based on six main steps: 1) division of the study area into sub-areas with similar characteristics in terms of coastal defense; 2) determining the probability of exceeding the pre-set thresholds of flood levels for each study area; 3) establishment of qualitative factors related to the consequences of such excess of the flood levels; 4) the combination of the above steps for expeditious assessment of flood risks; 5) identification of the risk areas; 6) proposal for risk adaptation. The determination of the flood levels is based on the local wave regime at the Faro wave-buoy over 9 years, on its propagation to the study area using the SWAN model integrated in the geographic information system (GIS), GUIOMAR, together with the calculation of run-up and flooding levels based on empirical formulae. Special emphasis is placed on the automation of this process in GUIOMAR to make it an efficient tool for risk assessment. To determine the risk of coastal flooding, a methodology has been developed using the geographic information system and a multi-criteria analysis to assess the vulnerability of the territory in several episodes of flooding and to determine the different risk areas.

AB  - The aeolian landscape comprising sandy beach and dunes is a highly dynamic and fragile system in the coastal area. Land uplift at Estonian coasts has created a series of different landforms. In this paper the researchers' attention is focused mainly on changes of Estonian coastal ecosystems in protected areas. The research is based on compiling landscape profiles, land cover maps and geobotanical studies. The aeolian coastal landscapes are diverse and the majority of their ecosystems are quite close to the specific natural habitat. Coastal ecosystems are strongly affected by their geomorphology, based on the character of deposits and moisture conditions. The coastal ecosystems are rapidly changed by waves, winds and human impact. The greatest decrease in the sandy beach vegetation is due to the heavy storms accompanied by high sea level conditions. Farther from the shore the landscape is older and natural processes have stabilised. Most of the area is covered by forests, the open communities occur occasionally in a narrow seaside belt.

AB  - A large earthquake shook the offshore region of Portugal in November 1 st 1755 with an estimated magnitude of 8.5±0.3 in the Richter scale. It lead to the massive destruction of the city of Lisbon, which was followed by intense fires. Although most of the detailed consequences of the earthquake and tsunami focused in Lisbon, the effect of tsunami destruction was also reported in other locations along the Peninsula coasts and Morocco. At Setúbal, located 30 km to the south of Lisbon in the Sado estuary, evidences of inundation were also documented, reporting wave heights that reached a first floor height. Despite the magnitude of the inundation in the interior of the estuary, there has not been reported any evidence of the impact of this event on the estuarine shorelines. In order to understand the consequences of such a wave on the sandy shores of the region, we explore the inlet shoreline and seaward exposed region of the estuary, the Tróia peninsula. To do so, we integrate multiple types of data and information: dune ridge position were extracted from aerial photographs, shorelines from the historical maps, shoreline progradation rates, Ground Penetrating Radar profiles and optically stimulated dating of barrier sediments. This information allows us to reconstruct the shoreline following the tsunami, documenting a greater impact towards the inlet where the water flow concentrate as it entered the estuary. The impact of the tsunami in Tróia peninsula translates on the erosion of about 1000 years of barrier deposits within the spit end. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Contaminants are present as mixtures in sediments within nearshore environments but are particularly associated with dredged material from historically industrialised areas. Ports, marinas and docks are continuously dredged for navigational purposes and material is usually disposed to sea. Recently, low contaminated dredged material is being considered for beneficial use to restore saltmarsh, recharge rivers and enhance estuarine areas impacted by natural or human activities. Where contaminants occur as mixtures, low levels of contaminants may act in an additive, synergistic or antagonist manner. Investigations of a range of mixture of metals using acute whole sediment bioassays have shown that metal mixtures appear to be less than additive. Nine metal mixtures were tested based on (1) a predicted model, (2) sediment quality guidelines (ERLJERM) and (3) Action Levels for assessing dredged material. Acute sediment bioassays using the polychaete, Arenicola marina, were conducted and results show that only one mixture was acutely toxic whilst casting rates of the other mixtures were reduced over a 10 day period, but these were not significantly different (p=<0.05) from the controls. Results show Arenicola marina to be more tolerant of high concentrations of metal mixtures than previously expected. Current risk assessment procedures and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) appear to be sufficiently precautionary at the lower 'uncontaminated' range which may lead to the increased beneficial use of dredged sediments; material that was once considered to be a waste product. © 2003 WIT Press.

AB  - The estuarine environment often hosts a salt wedge-a layer of denser seawater advected by the rising tide under fresh water discharged by the river. The nature of the stratification is a function of the tide's range and speed of advance, river discharge volumetric flow rate and river mouth morphology. The competing effects of temperature and salinity on sound speed present the question: Is the salt wedge acoustically observable? Using temperature and salinity profiles collected in situ, numerical results show that the salt wedge can impact acoustic propagation. Acoustically, this environment can be approximated by two isospeed layers separated by a thin gradient. While this three-layer very shallow water acoustic waveguide is typically dominated by high angle multipath propagation, refraction occurring in the gradient layer allows low-angle energy from near-surface sources to be trapped above the gradient and creates a shadow zone below the gradient. Energy from near-bottom sources is refracted to higher angles and attenuated more quickly. Acoustic fluctuations observed at an upstream/downstream receiver depend upon the presence/absence of bedforms and the interaction between the advancing/receding tide and the river discharge, which can include the presence of internal waves propagating along the top of the salt wedge.

AB  - <jats:p><p>The conventional view that marine populations are demographically ‘open’ and exchange migrants (juveniles or adults, but mostly larvae) has been challenged by recent genetic studies and the discovery of significant genetic subdivision among populations on small geographic scales. Despite the numerous publications on the matter, the extent to which some/all marine populations rely on self-recruitment and whether this reliance is stable in time and space currently remains unanswered. This is particularly true for populations from isolated oceanic archipelagos, such as the New Zealand (NZ) subantarctic islands and the Kermadec Islands. The specific objectives of this thesis were to: 1) assess the genetic diversity, phylogeography and contemporary levels of dispersal and self-recruitment in populations of the Cellana strigilis limpet complex, endemic to the NZ subantarctic islands; 2) conduct a morphometric analysis of the C. strigilis complex to complement its molecular investigation; 3) develop and optimize specific microsatellite markers for Nerita melanotragus, a marine gastropod of the Kermadec Islands and New Zealand North Island rocky shores; 4) assess the genetic structuring and levels of connectivity of N. melanotragus populations within the Kermadec Islands, within NZ North Island, and between the Kermadec Islands and NZ; and 5) compare the genetic structuring of N. melanotragus at the Kermadec Islands to that of NZ North Island populations, to test for any “island effect” on connectivity levels, and test for possible gene flow between the two groups. Genetic investigation of the C. strigilis complex confirmed the presence of two distinct lineages, separated by their sister species Cellana denticulata. Morphometric analyses were congruent with molecular analyses, and were used to provide a new taxonomic description of the C. strigilis limpet complex: two species were recognized, Cellana strigilis and Cellana oliveri. The role of the subantarctic islands during the last glacial maximum was highlighted, and the colonisation history of the islands by the two Cellana species was explained. Contemporary levels of connectivity (gene flow) among the different populations of the two lineages were low, or non-existant, revealing their high reliability on self-recruitment. However, the analysis detected a recent migration event in one of the two lineages. Considering the geographical distance of the islands and the life history of the Cellana species, the use of mediated dispersal means (e.g., rafting on a natural substrate such as kelp) seems very likely. Ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for N. melanotragus, and seven of those were used to investigate the levels of connectivity and self-recruitment in six populations from the Kermadec Islands, and nine populations from the east coast of NZ North Island. According to what can be expected for a species with a long pelagic larval duration (PLD), genetic homogeneity was recorded for the Kermadec Islands populations. A lack of genetic structuring was also found for the nine populations on the NZ North Island, which is congruent with the literature in this geographic area. However, what was surprising was the high level of genetic homogeneity found between the Kermadec Islands and the NZ North Island, meaning that the two groups are effectively exchanging individuals. Hence, the Kermadec archipelago can be considered “open” at the scale of the South Pacific, for N. melanotragus populations. This Ph.D. highlights the importance of having the correct taxonomy for conservation and connectivity studies, and gives a better understanding of the historical and contemporary patterns of genetic connectivity in the NZ offshore islands. It illustrated how historical events, such as the last glacial maximum, can shape local genetic diversity, and how this historical pattern can be maintained because of limited contemporary gene exchange. Also, this thesis demonstrated that remote pop lations could be strongly connected to mainland populations, contributing to the resilience of both systems and confirming the necessity of integrating remote oceanic habitats in the creation of effective Marine Protected Areas (MPA) networks to protect the marine environment.</p></jats:p>

AB  - A simulation model examined the influence of barrier islands on the estuarine ecosystems of Louisiana. Coastal barrier islands can act as a first line of protection for inland wetlands and human communities against storm waves and wind. These geomorphologic features provide wave reduction, flooding attenuation, and preservation of salinity gradients. Therefore, the model assessed the importance of the islands' relative location within the estuary. A hydrodynamic model computed wave height and circulation patterns for a test case. The results of this numerical experiment were then used to compute habitat composition and faunal response under holistic methodologies (e.g., regional Habitat Suitability Index [HSI] for a particular species). This analysis and simulation is presented as a first step in the development of a comprehensive model of estuary management with emphasis on barrier island restoration and preservation.

AB  - Eel grass beds in San Diego Bay are a protected habitat and artificial planting of beds is often accepted as mitigation for environmental disruption. The beds reduce sediment erosion, serve as a nursery for young fish and benthic organisms, and hence attract larger foragers. Though submarine light levels are felt to be the dominant control, individuals of a given species may have different light requirements when growing in different habitats of the same estuary and may require more light as variability in the available light increases. This paper looks at the areas where eel grass is growing and then to use depth, average water concentrations of chlorophyll and total suspended solids as a guide to understand what conditions make for suitable eel grass habitat in Diego Bay.

AB  - This paper deals with process-based simulations of distributed flood-control measures such as changes of land-use or soil-tillage practices, small retention ponds, and the rehabilitation of rivers aiming to quantify the flood-reducing effects. In this context several challenges have to be met, because these measures have different impacts on the whole rainfall-runoff process including runoff generation, runoff concentration, and flood routing. This study chooses a combined modelling approach that comprises the physically based rainfall-runoff model WaSiM-ETH (Version 8.4.2, SCHULLA 1997) and the 2D hydrodynamic numerical model HYDRO-AS-2D (NUJIC 1998) that is parameterized also by means of measurements in the field. On the one hand, these field data prove the influences of the different types of land uses (grassland, forest, ploughland) on soil hydraulic properties and provide the basis for the land-use-dependent parameterization of the soil model in WaSiM-ETH.The measurements show that the soil matrix under grassland has the best infiltration and water storage properties among the types of land use considered. On the other hand, in combination with laboratory studies, the collected data are used to identify the best fitting pedotransfer function for the study area, which is important to minimize uncertainties regarding the use of different types of pedotransfer functions in a physically based rainfall-runoff-model. After being constructed, parameterized, and calibrated, the models are coupled with an offline-connection by adding the runoff of each sub-basin in WaSiM-ETH to HYDRO-AS-2D as boundary conditions. The high fitting quality of calibration results demonstrates that the chosen coupled modelling approach can be applied in further research. The distributed flood control measures are parameterized by using field and laboratory data, literature sources, and historical marshland and drainage maps. Subsequently their flood-reducing effectiveness is quantified in the rural, mesoscale study area of the Windach catchment (AEZG 65 km2) for different flood events. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of flood-reducing measures is influenced on a case-by-case basis by different parameters, e.g. the course of the hydrograph, the peak flow or the runoff volume. The highest effect is achieved by an integrated concept including retention ponds, rehabilitation of rivers and marshlands as well as afforestation. In this case, peak flow can be reduced by 11 % (HQ100 advective event) to 26 % (HQ60, convective event). The small retention ponds (max. 50,000 m3) turned out to be the most effective single measures of distributed flood control as they can reduce the flood peak even of an advective HQ100 by roughly 10 %. Generally, decentralized flood control has the highest potential in the case of convective heavy rainfall events.

AB  - Coral reefs are iconic, threatened ecosystems that have been in existence for 6500 million years, yet their continued ecological persistence seems doubtful at present. Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamics that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent diseases due to increased heat and irradiation, as well as decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO2, are the most important large-scale threats. On more local scales, overfishing and destructive fisheries, coastal construction, nutrient enrichment, increased runoff and sedimentation, and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species have caused phase shifts away from corals. Already 620% of the world's reefs are lost and 626% are under imminent threat. Conservation science of coral reefs is well advanced, but its practical application has often been lagging. Societal priorites, economic pressures, and legal-administrative systems of many countries are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystems. Nevertheless, many examples of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action. When effectively managed, protected areas have contributed to regeneration of coral reefs and stocks of associated marine resources. Local communities often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism and-or improved resource levels. Coral reefs create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over $4 billion. Thus, no conflict between development, societal welfare, and coral-reef conservation needs to exist. Despite growing threats, it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystems. Conservation science plays a critical role in designing effective strategies.

AB  - 1. The spatial distribution of the most important subtidal habitats (coral reefs, coral carpets, seagrass meadows, sand with corals, macroids, mud, hardgrounds) and mangroves was mapped in northern Safaga Bay, Red Sea, Egypt. Coral communities were analysed separately for their ecological and spatial patterns. This, coupled with information about major current patterns in the bay, provides a framework on which to base impact predictions for planned developments or for those already underway. 2. Because the entire shoreline of northern Safaga Bay is earmarked for tourism development, the following impacts have already been observed and can be expected to worsen: dredging, coastal infilling, marina construction, alteration of inshore current patterns as a result of breakwater construction and eutrophication. 3. The maps of habitats could be used by management authorities to either license or forbid these activities in specific areas, thus avoiding damage to sensitive environments. Properly used, resource mapping is a powerful proactive management tool that allows resource managers to anticipate and avoid impacts at an early stage in the process.

AB  - Shoreline stability is an important issue along much of the Mediterranean's Coasts. European project MEDDOOC INTERREG BEACHMED-e focused on the strategic management of beach protection for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean coastal zone. In the framework of this project, a video system has been installed in Valras (Gulf of Lions/France) to monitor coastal evolutions and recent protection works. Over the past 20 years, coastal video remote sensing techniques represent an efficient alternative tool to classical in situ surveying techniques. Coastal video monitoring is based on Time exposure images (Timex) acquisition and photogrammetry technique which allows transforming 2D image coordinates into the corresponding 2D real world coordinates. This article presents the use of video monitoring technique to estimate the impact of engineering works. The results show: the natural erosion/accretion phases of the already protected shoreline, the impact of beach nourishment and the trend toward the equilibrium position of the restored shoreline, the efficiency of video monitoring for shoreline management.

AB  - <jats:title /> <jats:p>Our respect and understanding of the local environment is increasing with the recognition of its importance in our daily life. This is reflected in the Eco-Engineering Approach developed and used in dredging- and marine infrastructure projects. The approach starts with a thorough understanding of the local environment, and aims to increase overall value of the project both for nature, society and of course the project itself (economics and profitability). By focusing on synergies and development opportunities that strengthen both the environment and the project, construction and operational costs are reduced as well as lead times during permit process.</jats:p> <jats:p>We believe that this approach offers similar benefits to selected Offshore projects. It is based on the lessons learned and knowledge development gathered in the past years through the Building with Nature innovation programme, and experience gained from projects in daily practice. This allows for a head start on offshore projects.</jats:p> <jats:p>Eco-engineering starts from dedicated pre-project environmental monitoring to gain insight in the underlying physical and ecological processes. This provides the basis for project design and, later on, the construction and operation works. For nature, it is about recognizing key environmental values and the presence and resilience of sensitive receivers at an early stage. This enables optimization of project design and implementation of adaptive work methods with the objective to enhance habitat (soft and hard substrate), and to ensure minimal impact. For the physical environment, designs and work methods can be adapted to allow for beneficial use of natural forces such as sediment transport, currents and waves. Examples for offshore projects include landfalls in sensitive near shore/intertidal and wetland areas, landscaping of seabeds, scour protection and rock coverings to decrease volumes and increase ecological habitats and use of ecologically designed Gravity Based Structures acting as reefs.</jats:p> <jats:p>Joint development and implementation of the approach, and creation of support within the project stakeholder community are some of the major lessons learned and success factors of the Building with Nature innovation programme. By bringing together a broad range of stakeholders at start of the programme consisting of research institutes, universities, NGO’s and local stakeholders, industry, consultants and governments, ensures mutual understanding and respect for each other’s goals and approaches. Instead of being restrictive towards each other with continuous scrutiny during every step in the process, the network interacts and develops innovative knowledge, thereby strengthening each other’s ideas.</jats:p> <jats:p>Contractors played a key role in this development by initiating the Building with Nature programme, subsequently taking responsibility in contracts and developing and implementing the Eco-Engineering approach in daily practice. This approach contributes importantly to a sustainable future for both the sector/industry as well as the environment in which they operate.</jats:p>

AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) is increasing the risk of flooding in marginal low-lying estuarine areas. High water levels in estuaries are associated with the simultaneous occurrence of various phenomena ranging from high tidal levels to large fresh-water discharges. The present study aims to assess the vulnerability to floods of a specific area in Tagus estuary, by integrating hydrodynamic modelling results with land use cartography. Results suggest that about 16.1% of the estuarine marginal fringe could be flooded for the 2050 scenario, rising up to 23.7% for the 2100 scenario. Moreover, industrial and urban areas will be the most affected sites. Considering future development scenarios planned for that site, the results point to an increasing vulnerability of urban areas and therefore to the relevance of this knowledge in future planning and management guidelines as well as measures to adapt to SLR. The uncertainties and implications of the study are also discussed, and future research topics are indicated.

In: Conley, D.C., Masselink, G., Russell, P.E. and O’Hare, T.J. (eds.), Proceedings 12 th International Coastal Symposium (Plymouth, England), Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 65, pp. 820-825, ISSN 0749-0208. Sea level rise (SLR) is increasing the risk of flooding in marginal low-lying estuarine areas. High water levels in estuaries are associated with the simultaneous occurrence of various phenomena ranging from high tidal levels to large fresh-water discharges. The intense and diverse human occupation of some of these marginal areas increases the flood vulnerability, endangering human lives and causing heavy economic and environmental losses. This issue becomes even more relevant since the European Floods Directive establishes mandatory guidelines to all member states regarding flood risk assessment, integrating flood maps with territorial characteristics. The present study aims to assess the vulnerability to floods of a specific area in Tagus estuary, by integrating hydrodynamic modelling results with land use cartography. Results suggest that about 16.1% of the estuarine marginal fringe could be flooded for the 2050 scenario, rising up to 23.7% for the 2100 scenario. Moreover, industrial and urban areas will be the most affected sites. Considering future development scenarios planned for that site, the results point to an increasing vulnerability of urban areas and therefore to the relevance of this knowledge in future planning and management guidelines as well as measures to adapt to SLR.

AB  - The role of the US Army Corps of Engineers in coastal related Civil Works matters is described. The US Army Corps of Engineers has been very successful in national economic development through implementing projects along the National coastlines that optimized cargo throughput at the Ports and Harbors. The Corps of Engineers emphasizes both the importance of the whole watershed and the interdependence of its complex parts. The US Army Corps of Engineers is regionally addressing within the California's coastal zones the multiple objectives of coastal process analyses; navigation maintenance and improvements; shoreline protection; and restoration and enhancement of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Conference Title: 2015 IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics) Conference Start Date: 2015, July 29 Conference End Date: 2015, July 31 Conference Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Research on the history and archaeology of the Caribbean has demonstrated the overwhelming importance of commerce and long distance trading and social networks for the peopling and the social development of the lands circling the Caribbean Sea. Navigation -- riparian or maritime -- is paramount in this consideration because water is ubiquitous in the 'water world' of the Caribbean Lowlands. The area includes the basins and deltas of two of the world's largest rivers, the Amazon and the Orinoco systems, and widely complex coastal plains stretching from northern Brazil and Surinam to Mexico, south Florida and the Caribbean Archipelago. The coastal dry land masses (continent or islands) are joined by water: rivers, swamps, marshes or the sea: a continent divided by water'. When the chronology of the social dynamics surrounding the Caribbean Sea are scrutinized, the pattern that emerges is of land -- based economies and dispersed hunter -- gatherer sites starting around 14kBP, but there is no evidence of settlement along the coasts or exploitation of marine resources until around 8kBP on the continents, or 7-5kBP on the islands. These dates coincide with a general sea level stabilization at 3-5 m below msl around 7kya. As sea level rose, shallow coastal areas flooded, transforming the hydrology, oceanography and morphology of the coastlines. Given the rate of eustatic sea-level rise during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, much of the early coastal landscapes around the American continents and the Caribbean Islands should be currently submerged, along with the evidence of human use of ancient coasts. The dry sites we today assume as early reflect settlement patterns that correspond to a relatively late configuration of the coastal morphology. However, underwater archaeology in the Caribbean has mostly focused on wrecks, if on anything at all, with practically no attention being paid to drowned landscapes. No marine geophysics analysis has been applied to underwater archaeology in the Caribbean so far. Given that early evidence of human activity should be submerged and possibly buried, the application of acoustic remote sensing techniques is the most time and cost effective survey method. Among these, high-resolution multi-channel and 3D seismic reflection surveying, in particular 3D Chirp systems, have proven to be very useful for the investigation of drowned landscapes as they can provide detailed stratigraphic information and visualization of buried archaeological objects. Even though no local studies have been conducted yet, this presentation focuses on the northeastern corner of the Caribbean Archipelago, at the contact between the Greater and the Lesser Antilles (Mona Passage, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and the Anegada Passage), identifying areas with the highest potential for preservation of submerged landscapes and associated sites, from a geoarchaeological perspective. While side-scan sonars are useful to observe the sea floor and to identify shipwrecks or fishing technology, I emphasize on the potential of seismic surveys with sub-bottom profilers for the identification of buried ancient landscapes and associated sites, particularly in shallow, low-energy environments. This type of study and preliminary evaluation will serve as a basis to establish a solid collaborative research program that will permit a more complete understanding of the socio-natural dynamics of the peopling of the Caribbean region.

AB  - Phoslock™ is a specially modified clay designed to permanently bind phosphorus in those situations where phosphorus (P) release from sediments is a main driver of algal bloom formation. Extensive laboratory and mesocosm trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of Phoslock™ in binding sediment released P using less than a millimetre thickness of clay. Two full-scale applications were undertaken in the summer of 2001/2002 in the impounded riverine section of two estuaries along the coastal plain of south west Western Australia. Both rivers are subject to blue-green algal blooms in the summer months. Phoslock™ applied in a slurry from a small boat reduced dissolved P in the water column to below detection limit in the few hours it took for the clay to settle and substantially reduced P efflux from the sediments during the course of the trial. The effect of P reduction on phytoplankton growth was clearly evident in the phytoplankton dominated Vasse River but was less clear in the alternating phytoplankton to aquatic plant dominated Canning River which is also subject to surface nutrient inputs.

AB  - Aquaculture is perceived by governments and international agencies as an economic alternative for poor communities in developing countries. Nevertheless, aquaculture must address environmental issues as well as economic and social aspects to achieve a sustainable development. Aquaculture with native species under semi-intensive conditions is a sustainable production alternative that minimizes the impact on aquatic ecosystems. An aquaculture pilot project with pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) was tested in a protected lagoon in Uruguay (Laguna de Rocha). Shrimp were reared in pen enclosures within their native habitat, where natural currents drive water renewal, and the natural food supply was supplemented with commercial food. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of F. paulensis aquaculture on the water and sediment quality and the benthic community, and to estimate the maximum number of pen enclosures that Laguna de Rocha can sustain while maintaining the minimal environmental impact. A Before, After, Control Impact (BACI) sampling design was followed and the results of abiotic and biological variables were compared between treatment site (control, pens, and two areas at 15 and 50 m from the pens) and timing (before shrimp addition, during culture and after harvest), through ANOVA. The most significant impact was found inside the pens, where ammonium levels increased and benthos species richness and abundance decreased. A nitrogen-based-model was used to estimate the maximum number of pens in relation to the minimal impact on the ecosystem. Simulation indicated that up to 13 pens could be installed in the southern area of Laguna de Rocha without increasing the usual concentration of total nitrogen in other areas of the lagoon. The BACI design, the statistical analysis and the modeling tools proved to be effective, simple and low cost instruments to assess the environmental impact in a protected area. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - One of the aims of the UK Government's Making Space for Water programme is to provide greater clarity for both the public at risk of flooding or erosion and professional bodies involved in flood and coastal erosion risk management. At present, flood risk from rivers and the sea is mapped to inform the public and authorities. However, limited information is available on the risk from coastal erosion. In 2006, Halcrow were commissioned by the Environment Agency to undertake the National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping project. This project aims to map coastal erosion risk, whilst taking account of the influence of current coastal protection and management activities. The project is due to be completed in 2009. This paper presents the results of the First National Run, which has utilised national datasets, and the means by which the input data can be validated by employing innovative web-based mapping techniques to enable local expert verification. This will ultimately result in the first nationally consistent coastal erosion hazard maps for England and Wales.

AB  - On the Pará River (estuary) there are approximately one hundred tidal channels. These channels are important systems in both ecological and socio-economic systems. This paper aims to determine the tidal propagation pattern in the tidal channels in the dry and rainy seasons. Three tidal channels were selected on the left margin (Marajó Island). In a first experiment, two pressure sensors were installed in each channel for 13 hours during a spring tide, one in the mouth and the other approximately 3 km upstream. In a second experiment, 3 pressure sensors were installed in one of the channels (36 days): one outside the channel (Pará river), one in the mouth and another one upstream in the channel. The first experiment revealed that the channels have similar pattern and asymmetric tidal regime, whose flood takes approximately 4 h and the ebb, 8 hours. The absence of an effective river discharge may favour the flood. The presence of sandy banks in the mouth of these channels trap the water inside, which makes the ebb last longer. In the second experiment, harmonic tidal constituents were obtained at the outside point. In the channel and channel mouth there was no variation in the low tidal level during the dry season, possibly due to morphology effects. In the rainy season there was slight variation in low tide level and this was more evident on the spring tide. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Seagrasses are flowering plants that inhabit coastal and transitional waters. They colonize sedimentary seabeds (and to a lesser extent rocky substrates) and present unique adaptations to the marine environment. Seagrasses are especially sensitive to environmental deterioration and live in a world that is particularly threatened by human activity. The response of the plants and their associated communities to disturbances is relatively well known. This has facilitated the development of a large number of seagrass bioindicators based on biochemical, physiological, morphological, structural, demographic, and community measures, especially after the deployment of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to a lesser extent the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Bioindicators are at the interface between science and policy. In order for their use by managers for different purposes (monitoring, water quality assessment, long-term changes, etc.) to be robust and consistent, a clear definition of management goals is needed. The development of bioindicators must also be based on careful evaluation together with rigorous and transparent selection processes to ensure their scientific credibility. Here, we present bioindicator indices based on seagrasses that were developed with the context of the implementation of the WFD in Catalonia, NE Spain, to assess the ecological status of coastal and transitional water bodies. Ecological status includes aspects concerning both the quality of the biological community and the hydrological and chemical characteristics of the environment. For this reason, and to develop a WFD-compliant system for ecological status assessment based on Mediterranean seagrasses, we used multivariate techniques to combine different bioindicators, gathered from different levels within the biological organization, into single biotic indices (POMI and CYMOX, based on the species Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, respectively). We report how this was achieved and how the robustness and reliability of those indices were assessed through correlation with human pressures, uncertainty analysis, and intercalibration. Finally, besides their applicability, we discuss their shortcomings and what we, as seagrass biologists, have learned overall from responding to the challenges posed by the WFD and specifically by the part dealing with seagrasses. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - In August 2011 the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) was realized at the entrance of the tidal dock 'Deurganckdok' in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Equipped with container terminals, Deurganckdok can receive vessels with a draught of 13,10m independent of the tide. Due to its position in a stretch of the Schelde estuary with salinity gradients near the estuarine turbidity maximum, Deurganckdok is subject to siltation. Accumulation of fine-grained cohesive sediments in the dock runs up to 1 million m3 annually and requires regular maintenance dredging. During the early stages of preliminary investigations for Deurganckdok (1997-1999), the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW) was selected as a measure to reduce sedimentation. The design was adapted to function in an environment with salinity gradients during the feasibility research (2001-2004), which included physical and numerical modelling, supported by field measurements. Initial calculations predicted a reduction of 10-20% in sediment accumulation. In the final phase of investigations (2005-2007), state-of-the-art numerical models were calibrated with field measurements to enhance sediment accumulation predictions under a range of boundary conditions. In this paper the results are summarized of the preliminary investigations that have led to the design of the Current Deflecting Wall (CDW).

AB  - There is a high variability of the coastal environments in the Virginia Chesapeake Bay area influenced by: (1) the relict Pleistocene high-order dendritic drainage system; (2) the highly variable wave energy in the Bay system and highly variable submergence rates; (3) exposures of coastal plain sediments of widely varying composition and volume; and (4) diverse salt marsh development. Eighty percent of the shore is composed of 3 morphologically distinct beach environments: (1) Permeable beaches, comprise 59% of the beaches (mean erosion = 0.85 m/yr) and have the largest vertical and horizontal dimensions. This provides the largest vertical buffer to the effects of storm surge and waves. (2) Impermeable beaches, comprise 24% of the beaches. The combined influence of low swash infiltration, low beach elevation and groundwater effects result in the highest mean erosion (1.14 m/yr). (3) Marsh barrier beaches (17%), contains a resistant rhizome framework, resulting in the least erodable beach environment (0.66 m /yr). Marsh margins, the remaining 20% of the shoreline, are the least erodable shore environment (0.54 m/yr). There is a large variability in the local subsidence rates along the shoreline. The subsidence highs correspond to the areas with largest nearshore terraces and the main concentrations of salt marsh development. A balance in the shore stability exists as a result of salt marsh development: The marsh retards shore erosion, yet it occurs at the areas of highest local submergence where the highest shoreline retreat is expected.

AB  - The requirement for using a participatory approach to consider options for adapting to climate change is well documented, but there are some key challenges of engaging with communities, especially over the complexities of projected climate change impacts and possible adaptation options. Here we describe the development of a two-stage method aimed to overcome these challenges, and the testing of this method in a coastal community in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island of New Zealand. First, at an Open Day we used projections of sea-level rise driven changes to coastal inundation, erosion and habitat change and mapped them on large aerial-photo maps to use as the basis for a participatory mapping exercise. The purpose of the Open Day was to elicit input on valued aspects of the Whitianga community that might be at threat from climate change. Second, at a follow-up Workshop we worked with the community to explore the potential for adaptation options to provide 'solutions' to these issues, exploring who the winners and losers would be for each option, and what would be required to enable the options to be actioned. The maps were a key tool in this engagement case-study, and we reflect on them in our discussion of their development and usefulness. Finally we summarise the lessons learned in this case study and describe four key inputs to successful community engagement: the right team, the right data, the right support, and the right resources. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - The requirement for using a participatory approach to consider options for adapting to climate change is well documented, but there are some key challenges of engaging with communities. In this article, the authors have describe the development of a two-stage method aimed to overcome these challenges, and the testing of this method in a coastal community in Whitianga on the Coromandel Peninsula, North Island of New Zealand. First, at an Open Day, they used projections of sea-level rise driven changes to coastal inundation, erosion and habitat change and mapped them on large aerial-photo maps to use as the basis for a participatory mapping exercise. The purpose of the Open Day was to elicit input on valued aspects of the Whitianga community that might be at threat from climate change. Finally, they summarise the lessons learned in this case study and describe four key inputs to successful community engagement: the right team, the right data, the right support, and the right resources.

AB  - In the context of a major Florida wetlands restoration project, it was necessary to distribute flows over a land area on a continuing basis in a way that promoted recovery of overland flows and recharge to a more natural condition. Complicating this requirement was the limited available head to drive hydraulic processes, because of the very flat coastal Florida landscape, and the need to deal with all levels of flow from major flood events down to gentle summer storms, all in the complete absence of defined downstream drainage works. A substantial literature review was conducted to evaluate prior approaches to this problem. Parallels were discovered, principally in the agricultural literature, but closely similar projects were not encountered. Solutions considered ranged from concrete hydraulic structures with energy dissipation and overflow weir systems, to simple trenches orthogonal to the landform gradients. It was concluded that although they might be effective, concrete structural options were costly, were prone to excessive head losses, and did not lend themselves to integration into the natural landscape. Overflow trenches were attractive in their simplicity, but raised the specter of eventual cut-down and development of preferential flow paths rather than development of broad wetland areas. The preferred solution consisted of long spreader berms with numerous controlled overflow points. This option not only integrates nicely with the prevailing landscape, but can be adapted in the long term as management of the system is adjusted to meet the needs of the evolving ecosystem during its recovery period. © 2007 ASCE.

AB  - The arrival of the Chinese mitten crab to the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin Delta (Bay-Delta) ecosystem has been a source of widespread concern. This crab has spread from its native range, in China, to coastal ecosystems throughout Europe and, most recently, into North America. The Chinese mitten crab population in California has exploded within the last decade to cover hundreds of miles of the Bay-Delta and its tributaries. The Chinese mitten crab is a large, catadromous crab, moving from freshwater habitats where it spends its juvenile years to saltwater habitats in order to reproduce. In other countries into which this species has been introduced, the abundance and behavior of the crab has caused detrimental impacts to fisheries and loss of bank stability in areas where it burrows. Through a grant from the Water Resources Center, we set out to examine the ecology, distribution, and economic and ecological impacts of the Chinese mitten crab in the fresh and saline waters of San Francisco's South Bay. The Chinese mitten crab offers excellent opportunities to: 1) study the population dynamics of an invasive species; 2) examine differences and similarities for this organism between its native and new environments; and 3) use research findings to make recommendations for understanding and control of this organism. We surveyed the tributaries and main body of South San Francisco Bay in order to examine the ecology and impacts of the Chinese mitten crab. We studied distribution and abundance of juvenile crabs by establishing 72 monitoring sites throughout the salinity gradient of several major South Bay tributaries. These sites were used in 1995, 1996 and 1999 to collect population and habitat data. Adult crabs in the South Bay were monitored using otter trawls over the same three-year period. Population parameters of mitten crabs, including size and sex ratios, were examined. We quantified habitat preferences of the mitten crab by examining stream characteristics including substrate type, vegetation type, and salinity. Gut contents were analyzed in order to examine dietary habits and dietary shifts with age, and frequent behavioral observations of crabs were made to confirm dietary and habitat preference data. In order to examine impacts to banks and levees, we examined burrowing by juvenile crabs and quantified sediment removal from burrowing by estimating burrow density and sediment removed per burrow. The potential impacts of Chinese mitten crab on two species of freshwater crayfish were studied using a combination of behavioral observations, laboratory experiments and surveys of the commercial crayfish industry. We found mitten crabs to be broadly distributed throughout the freshwater tributaries of the South Bay, with the distribution spreading over the three years we monitored these sites. Adult mitten crabs were also found in the main body of the bay, with gravid (egg-carrying) females appearing between November and May of each year. Juvenile mitten crabs preferred intertidal sections of streams that had banks with high clay content and abundant vegetation overhanging or growing on the banks. Gut content analysis of mitten crabs revealed a high proportion of vegetative matter, with low amounts of invertebrates, regardless of the size of the crab or the habitat from which it was collected. Abundance of Chinese mitten crab also increased over time, as seen by a continuous increase in burrow densities: densities reached a high of 18/ m2 at one site in 1995 and 1996, and densities exceeded 30 burrows/ m2 at two sites in 1999. Densities exceeding 30 burrows/ m2 are considered to be damage-causing levels in other areas into which the crab has been introduced. Research into the impacts of Chinese mitten crabs on crayfish populations produced mixed results: based on behavioral observations, crabs and crayfish in the South Bay were found to co-occur; crayfish industry surveys revealed concern regarding potential competition of crayfish and mitten crabs; and experimental interactions suggested possible habitat competitio between adults of crayfish and mitten crabs. We present these findings in coordination with studies occurring in the North Bay, the Delta and throughout California which show that the Chinese mitten crab is quickly spreading throughout all of northern California, and has recently reached southern California through the state's aqueduct system. In addition, the sheer abundance of the crab has created significant impacts on the state's water projects. In particular, efforts to minimize impacts to fish from water project turbines and pumps have been seriously impeded by the crabs clogging these systems during their fall migration. The results of our research include important findings for the spread of the organism, similarities and differences between its ecology here and in its native range, and impacts on physical and biological characteristics of San Francisco Bay. We have shown that the mitten crab population has exploded in the South Bay as well as throughout the Bay-Delta region. The highest densities of mitten crab burrows are currently restricted to intertidal segments of the banks and levees; however, at some locations within these areas, bank slumping and erosion already are significant. We believe that there is cause for concern for impacts on freshwater crayfish, although more research needs to be done to quantify these impacts. Given the widespread distribution, abundance, and lack of specialized predators for the Chinese mitten crab, we believe complete control of this species would be extremely difficult and costly. A more effective strategy will be to focus control in specific regions where the crab is producing costly and damaging effects, such as the fish protection programs at state water projects. State and private parties have discussed commercialization of the mitten crab for consumption here or in Asia, and this option could provide an effective, though controversial, method of control. Our findings suggest that the mitten crab is here to stay as yet another member of San Francisco's evolving non-indigenous communities.

AB  - Coastal erosion is common along the unconsolidated shoreline of northern France where coastal dunes frequently form a natural barrier protecting the reclaimed lands of the coastal plain from marine flooding. A study was conducted on the Sangatte coastal dunes, west of the town of Calais in the Dover Strait, in order to assess the vulnerability of the coastal zone to extreme flooding events. The study combines geomorphology-based and statistical methodologies by using terrain elevation and extreme water level data derived from telemetric and tide-gauge measurements. Tide-gauge data from 1965 to 2001 were used to estimate the heights of extreme water levels with return periods of 10, 50 and 100 years by the year 2050, including projected mean sea level rise. Airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data were collected over an area of approximately 14 km2 and were used to produce potential flood maps for extreme water levels based on high-resolution Digital Elevation Models. The results show that a low area to the east could be overtopped by high water levels if a significant storm surge occurs at high tide. In the western part of the dune system, crest elevations are significantly higher, preventing marine water incursions, but the foredune being much narrower in that area, marine erosion may lead to breaching and eventually flooding in the near future. This study demonstrates the interest of airborne LiDAR for coastal management issues by providing accurate topographic mapping over extensive areas and identifying the zones that are the most sensitive to coastal hazards. © 2008 Gebrüder Borntraeger.

Dies ist unter anderem auf die potentiell negativen Auswirkungen des beschleunigten Meeresspiegelanstiegs auf die ohnehin gefahrdeten tidebeeinflusten Lebensraume zuruckzufuhren. Eine vergleichende Studie der Einstellung zu managed realignment in England und Deutschland hatte zum Ziel, sowohl Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede festzustellen, als auch die zukunftige Nutzung dieser Kustenmanagementmasnahme einzuschatzen. Wahrend die Erwagung von managed realignment generell als eine positive Entwicklung empfunden wird, wurden bedeutende und manchmal uberraschende Unterschiede in der Anwendung gefunden—abhangig von verschiedenen Faktoren wie z.B.

AB  - The Delta Project is in its final stage. In 1974 it was subjected to political reconsideration, but it is scheduled now for completion in 1987. The final touches are being put to the storm-surge barrier and two compartment dams that divide the Oosterschelde into three areas: one tidal, one with reduced tide, and one a freshwater lake. This article focusses on the area with reduced tide and compares present day and expected characteristics. In this reduced tidal part salt marshes will extend by 30-70%; intertidal flats will erode to a lower level and at their edges, and the area of shallow water will increase by 47%. Biomass production on the intertidal flats will decrease, with consequences for crustaceans, fishes and birds. The maximum number of waders counted on one day and the number of 'bird-days' will decrease drastically, with negative effects for the wader populations of western Europe. The net area with a hard substratum in the reduced tidal part has more than doubled. Channels will become shallower. Stratification and oxygen depletion will be rare and local. The operation of the storm-surge barrier and the closure strategy chosen are very important for the ecosystem. It was essential to determine a clearly defined plan of action for the whole area, and to make land-use choices from the outset. How this was done is briefly described.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. The Kapuas River delta is a unique estuary system on the western coast of the island of Borneo, Indonesia. Its hydrodynamics are driven by an interplay between storm surges, tides, and river discharges. These interactions are likely to be exacerbated by global warming, leading to more frequent compound flooding in the area. The mechanisms driving compound flooding events in the Kapuas River delta remain, however, poorly known. Here we attempt to fill this gap by assessing the interactions between river discharges, tides, and storm surges and how they can drive a compound inundation over the riverbanks, particularly within Pontianak, the main city along the Kapuas River. We simulated these interactions using the multi-scale hydrodynamic model SLIM (Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model). Our model correctly reproduces the Kapuas River's hydrodynamics and its interactions with tides and storm surge from the Karimata Strait. We considered several extreme-scenario test cases to evaluate the impact of tide–storm–discharge interactions on the maximum water level profile from the river mouth to the upstream part of the river. Based on the maximum water level profiles, we divide the Kapuas River's stream into three zones, i.e., the tidally dominated region (from the river mouth to about 30 km upstream), the transition region (from about 30 km to about 150 km upstream), and the river-dominated region (beyond 150 km upstream). Thus, the local water management can define proper mitigation for handling compound flooding hazards along the riverbanks by using this zoning category. The model also successfully reproduced a compound flooding event in Pontianak, which occurred on 29 December 2018. For this event, the wind-generated surge appeared to be the dominant trigger. </jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>An intensive shrimp culture in Thailand has rapidly expanded especially along the coast during the last decade. Excessive feed basically given during the culture causes water and sediment in the pond to contain organic matter and nutrients in high concentration. After harvesting, discharging sediment is prohibited; however, pond water is mostly discharged directly to natural water resources without any effective treatment. The nutrient load discharged from shrimp ponds can form significant source of nutrients causing pollution and eutrophication in littoral areas of Thailand. The possibility of a subsurface-flow constructed wetlands application for treating shrimp pond effluent containing high salinity was studied. An experimental-scaled model planted with Acrostchum aureum (mangrove fern) in gravel was studied by comparison with one containing only gravel. The results showed that models can reduce suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demands, total organic carbon, totel nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorous (T-P) up to 84%, 91%, 46%, 48% and 31%, respectively. Higher removal efficiencies for TOC, T-N and T-P of the planted model compared with the gravel model were clearly found.</jats:p>

The possibility of essential decreasing not only wave height, but the mean period of waves was testified. It was revealed that a system of two reefs better reduces the mean wave period. The decreasing of the mean wave period depends on the distance between the reefs. It was shown that submerged structures can influence on transport of sediments due to change of asymmetry of waves passing above them.

AB  - A multidisciplinary project on an archaeological site on the Mitchell River, which feeds into Choctawhatchee Bay on the Florida panhandle, was designed to understand human adaptations to a dynamic hydrological environment during the Middle and Late Archaic period (ca. 80003000 B.P.). Now in a freshwater environment, on a sandy terrace above the Mitchell River floodplain, the Mitchell River 1 archaeological site contains an oyster-shell midden and other features indicating human exploitation of an estuarine environment. Estuarine exploitation at the site occurred over a long span of time, from around 7300 to 3400 2cal B.P., although the site was abandoned two or three times over the millennia. The site was more permanently abandoned after 3400 B.P. Because estuarine shellfish, such as oysters, are low trophic level species, they have been considered marginal resources, and archaeologists modeling collector strategies assume that people will not travel far to obtain them. Under an optimal foraging model, estuarine resources should have been closer to the site than at present. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to address whether a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand had produced estuarine conditions in the Mitchell River floodplain during the Archaic. Using microfossils and stratigraphy from a dated core taken in the floodplain due south of the site, the project members attempted to correlate the changing paleoenvironment with human occupation and abandonment of the area. Results indicate that, at ca. 7300 cal B.P., when the Mitchell River 1 site was first inhabited, the floodplain was a shallow, open, sedge marsh. The site inhabitants must have traveled some distance to gather the oysters and other estuarine species that were discarded on the site. The earliest occupation was brief, but the site was reoccupied between 5900 and 5300 cal B.P., when the floodplain had become a Taxodium/Nyssa swamp. Site deposits indicate intensive exploitation of oyster and to a lesser extent Rangia, which may have been closer to the site than at 7300 B.P. but still would have required some travel. At some point, the mouth of the Mitchell River was forced eastward, and the bayhead delta, recognized as a 2-meter-deep wedge of sand in the core, was located adjacent to the site. By 4700 cal B.P., brackish water conditions prevailed, although direct evidence of oyster beds in the immediate area is lacking. Unfortunately, scouring of the core sediments sometime after 4700 cal B.P. destroyed the paleoenvironmental record for the last part of the Archaic occupation of the site. However, some evidence in Core 1, along with research elsewhere on the Florida panhandle, suggests that catastrophic storms may have played a part in the more permanent abandonment of the site after 3400 B.P.

AB  - Discusses observations of the effects of Hurricane Alicia (August 1983) on the Texas coastal area. Describes the estimation of maximum water levels and assessment of shore changes. Maximum water elevations ranged from 6 feet to about 10 feet, and dunes were extensively overtopped. Tabulates the change in water line, change in vegetation line, erosion of vegetation line and overwash for several locations, noting the respective distance from the centre of the storm. Recession prevailed to the right of the storm, while accretion prevailed on the left side. Large erosive waves, generated by the onshore wind during the nearshore storm surge were closely confined to the area of the strong onshore winds. Discussed the changes, noting scour cut variations.

AB  - Deltas are a special type of alluvial estuaries, which are complex systems. They form the interface between the terrestrial drainage system and the sea. Deltas have multiple functions: morphologic, hydraulic, hydrologic, ecologic and socio-economic. They are also the areas where different sources of energy converge: tidal energy, wind energy, potential energy from freshwater and sediments, and solar energy to feed the biotic system. The dissipation of all this energy has created a unique environment, with very special tidal and morphologic characteristics. One would expect that such a complex system is difficult to describe in simple mathematical terms, but the opposite is true. If considered at the right scale, deltas and estuaries appear to obey surprisingly simple "laws". For instance: the shape of an alluvial estuary obeys a simple exponential law; the amplitude of the tidal velocity is 1 m/s at spring tide throughout the tidal region; and more surprisingly, this amplitude is the same throughout the world. If left undisturbed, estuaries tend to become "ideal" estuaries, where the tidal wave is undamped, propagating as a simple shallow water wave. As a result, there is also simplicity in the process of salt intrusion and the mixing of substances in estuaries. There are two important research questions related to this surprising simplicity. The first is of course the understanding of the more fundamental physical laws behind this surprising simplicity and uniformity; the second is how to predict the behaviour of estuaries in poorly-gauged regions, because this simplicity may help us to predict how estuaries behave when we have very limited knowledge on the ground. In this presentation, examples are given of two major deltas where predictive equations appear to work remarkably well.

AB  - The Russian tanker NAKHODKA spilled approximately 86,600 kiloliters of heavy C oil in the Sea of Japan on January 2, 1997. By this accident, more than 2,000 kilometers of coastline along the Sea of Japan has been affected. Spilt oil was stranded on a 4-kilometer sand beach from Katano to Shioya on January 7. Soon after the oil beached, recovery works were done by heavy machinery without taking account of plant vegetation. These recovery works were completed with a large amount of oil mixed in with the sand. Plant vegetation on this beach was seriously damaged. One year after the oil spill, many parts of the plant vegetation disappeared here and there on this beach. It has become clear that plant vegetation plays a great role in protecting sand beach from erosion. Observing this case, environmental sensitivity of sand beaches should be classified into two groups: one is sand beach with plant vegetation, the other is without plant vegetation. The former is more sensitive.

AB  - Geomorphologic and chronostratigraphic investigations in various coastal localities along the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast, from Bahia Vera (44...) in the north to San Julian (49...) in the south, confirm a rich sequence of Holocene beach ridge systems and littoral and valley-mouth terraces. Beach ridges are present up to 10 m above current highest tide level (hTw) and date to the early mid-Holocene transgression maximum. Beach-ridge deposits represent high-energy, wave dominated coastal environments, whereas valley-mouth terraces and littoral terraces (elevations of 5.5-6.5 m above hTw) developed in wave-protected coastal environments. The surface elevation of these littoral forms suggest that the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast is likely undergoing a slow glacio-isostatic uplift on the order of 0.3- 0.4 mm/a since the mid-Holocene. The early Holocene sea-level rise reached the modern coastline by 8100 ...C years ago (c. 8600 cal BP) at the latest. Sea level at that time was most likely near its present position. The Holocene transgression maximum lasted from 6900 to at least 6200 ...C BP (c. 7400 to 6600 cal BP), raising relative sea level to about 2 m to a maximum of 3 m above the present level, after which sea level declined to the present level. Two significant sea-level falls of at most 1 m occurred: a) between 6200 and 6000 ...C BP (c. 6600 to 6400 cal BP), and b) between 2600 and 2400 ...C BP (c. 2300 to 2050 cal BP). We assume, that both significant sea-level falls were predominantly driven by eustatic changes of ocean volume, whereas both thermo-steric changes and changes of tides may also have contributed to these relatively strong sea-level drops. Gravitational changes driven by Greenland ice growth (sensu Mitrovica et al., 2001) may also have amplified any eustatic portion of sea-level fall. The trend of a general sea-level decline since the mid-Holocene transgression maximum seems to be predominantly glacio-isostatically driven. (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae/symbols omitted.)

AB  - Near-field tsunami propagation both in shallow water environments and bore-like wave propagation on land are conducted in this study to obtain fundamental knowledge on the tsunami hazard potential in the city of Padang, Western Sumatra, Republic of Indonesia. As the region proves a huge seismic moment deficit which has progressively accumulated since the last recorded major earthquakes in 1797 and 1833, this investigation focuses on most reasonable seismic sources and possibly triggered nearshore tsunamis in order to develop upgraded disaster mitigations programs in this densely-populated urban agglomeration located on the western shore of Sumatra Island. Observations from continuous Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) systems and supplementary coral growth studies confirm a much greater probability of occurrence that a major earthquake and subsequent tsunami are likely to strike the region in the near future. Newly surveyed and processed sets of geodata have been collected and used to progress most plausible rupture scenarios to approximate the extent and magnitudes of a further earthquake. Based upon this novel understanding, the present analysis applies two hydronumerical codes to simulate most probable tsunami run-up and subsequent inundations in the city of Padang in very fine resolution. Run-up heights and flow-depths are determined stemming from these most plausible rupture scenarios. Evaluation of outcome and performance of both numerical tools regarding impacts of surge flow and bore-like wave fronts encountering the coast and inundating the city are thoroughly carried out. Results are discussed not only for further scientific purposes, i.e. benchmark tests, but also to disseminate main findings to responsible authorities in Padang with the objective to distribute the most probable dataset of plausible tsunami inundations as well as to address valuable insights and knowledge for effective counter measures, i.e. evacuation routes and shelter building. Following evacuation simulations based on rational assumptions and simplifications reveal a most alerting result as about 260.000 people are living in the highly exposed potential tsunami inundation area in the city of Padang of which more than 90.000 people will need more than 30 min. to evacuate to safe areas.

AB  - Borrow pits, dug by industry to provide substrate for infrastructure such as roads and well sites, are prevalent throughout the boreal forest of western Canada yet little is known about their use by wildlife. During field surveys in Rainbow Lake, Alberta, we found that beavers (Castor canadensis) used inundated borrow pits extensively for foraging and over wintering, suggesting that borrow pits increase beaver populations above their natural carrying capacity in industrial landscapes. We visited a random sample of 90 borrow pits in the field and categorized them as having active beaver lodges with caches (n =16), inactive lodges (n = 13), cutting (n = 29), no activity (n = 13), or as not inundated or not a borrow pit (n = 19). We then used this sample to model where beavers established lodges versus where they were inactive or were only cutting. We found that borrow pits with active lodges had unique characteristics from other pits in our sample and were closer to streams, marshes, and swamps and had greater vegetation concealment from roads. These models can be used by managers to develop methods for increasing or decreasing the abundance of beavers living at borrow pits. Wildlife managers might want to use borrow pits to increase beaver abundance because of the positive effects beavers can have on ecosystems and because beavers are an important source of food for boreal carnivores. For example, we found that wolverines (Gulo gulo) used borrow pits as hunting grounds for beavers and one wolverine denned within a beaver lodge at a borrow pit. Conversely, managers might want to reduce beaver populations living at borrow pits because of the damage that beavers can cause to infrastructure and because subsidized beaver populations might alter predator-prey dynamics. To accomplish this, we suggest reducing available vegetation around borrow pits, isolating new borrow pits from natural beaver habitats, digging borrow pits where there is less chance of having surface water, filling in borrow pits with substrate, or not creating borrow pits and using a centralized gravel pit or mine for substrate.

AB  - Abstract. River valley bottoms have hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological importance and are buffers for protecting the river from upland nutrient loading coming from agriculture and other sources. They are relatively flat, low-lying areas of the terrain that are adjacent to the river and bound by increasing slopes at the transition to the uplands. These areas have under natural conditions, a groundwater table close to the soil surface. The objective of this paper is to present a stepwise GIS approach for the delineation of river valley bottom within drainage basins and use it to perform a national delineation. We developed a tool that applies a concept called cost distance accumulation with spatial data inputs consisting a river network and slope derived from a digital elevation model. We then used wetlands adjacent to rivers as a guide finding the river valley bottom boundary from the cost distance accumulation. We present results from our tool for the whole country of Denmark carrying out a validation within three selected areas. The results reveal that the tool visually performs well and delineates both confined and unconfined river valleys within the same drainage basin. We use the most common forms of wetlands (meadow and marsh) in Denmark's river valleys known as Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDE) to validate our river valley bottom delineated areas. Our delineation picks about half to two-thirds of these GDE. However, we expected this since farmers have reclaimed Denmark's low-lying areas during the last 200 years before the first map of GDE was created. Our tool can be used as a management tool, since it can delineate an area that has been the focus of management actions to protect waterways from upland nutrient pollution.

AB  - Natural morphologies, such as sand dunes, river mouth bars and wetlands around a river mouth, are formed by dynamic processes of waves, river currents and wind, and are dynamically stable unless a large-scale anthropogenic effect is induced. Their coastal protection and ecosystem functions for maintaining habitats of many organisms were re-evaluated. The sand dune and wetland in front of an earth dike were maintained as they were, and the overall morphology was regarded as a shore protection facility against storm surges. The setting back of the protection line for maintaining a sand bar and a salt marsh was planned for the first time in Japan with the participation of local citizens and stakeholders, and the construction was completed in 2005. These conservation activities are effective not only for enhancing the safety of the area but also for keeping the sustainability of fishery. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Coastal regions have progressively become more vulnerable to intense hydrodynamic and atmospheric events, thus raising important questions about their fate in the century of global warming. A variety of natural and anthropogenic factors have contributed to this fragility: eustacy, isostasy, soil compaction, reduced sediment supply and reduced extension of natural defenses (barrier islands and coastal wetlands). With the aim to emphasize the crucial role played by the intense human manipulation of the environment, we provide a brief overview of the state of knowledge on this extremely complex problem, moving from two cases of special importance: Venice and New Orleans. We discuss similarities (causes of wetland degradation and related restoration problems) as well as differences (different economical scales involved in the restoration projects, different risk reduction ensured by wetland and natural defense restoration and, fi nally, cultural relevance of the environment to be preserved) between these two regions.

AB  - A multitude of research has been conducted across the U.S. on hazard resilience and the need for coastal communities to be able to adapt to coastal storms. Two tools have been created to convey research findings to assist local decision makers as they make future preparations for storm events. The Coastal Resilience Index is a self-assessment tool communities can use to identify their vulnerabilities so they can address these weaknesses before the next storm. The StormSmart Coasts Network is a web-based tool that connects local officials to resilience-related resources, and allows communities to communicate and collaborate between local municipalities, states, and nationwide concerning issues such as coastal storms, sea level rise, and climate change. Both tools demonstrate how application of research findings makes a difference in coastal communities. ©2009 MTS.

AB  - Three options for dealing with oily debris from oil contaminated shorelines are studied. It is shown that bunker oil does not affect plant life but does kill the invertebrates in the contaminated supralittoral zone. A non-sticky soil surface can be established if treated with a sorbent. Oily debris picked up by hand, composted with sorbents, and conditioned with fertilizers showed a decrease in total oil content of approximately 60 percent after 400 days. The addition of sorbents gave approximately the same rate of biodegradation, whereas the addition of fertilizer alone had a less beneficial effect on oil biodegradation. The use of sorbents did not affect the generation of leachate water from the compost piles. The oil content in the leachate was between 20 and 40 milligrams per liter. Seaweed in the oily debris decomposed rapidly. The volume of the piles was reduced by about 50 percent. Total oil content was approximately constant in the compost piles. The rapidly decomposing seaweed made it difficult to keep the compost piles in an aerobic state. Oily debris mixed with lime (CaO) produced a dry material. The lime volume required was approximately equal to the oil volume in the debris. Even after this treatment, some oil and other organic components were released with the leachate. The process of mixing lime into the oily debris was very unpleasant for the workers and posed a severe working-environment problem.

AB  - Conference Title: 2015 IEEE/OES Eleventh Current, Waves and Turbulence Measurement (CWTM) Conference Start Date: 2015, March 2 Conference End Date: 2015, March 6 Conference Location: St. Petersburg, FL, USA In situ sea state measurements are essential for offshore activities, coastal protection and science (here in example for the validation of numerical models and of earthor satellite-based remote sensing instruments). Therefore, well quality checked data is a must. Up to now it is difficult to discriminate between outliers and extreme waves in raw surface wave displacement time series. A consequence of this fact is the uncertainty of the correctness of the maximum wave height in a time period and of extreme waves at all. A first approach method has been developed considering some physically motivated singlewave features. Aim of the development in progress is a fully automated procedure to ensure the sea state time series quality in regard of the discrimination of outliers and extreme waves; in consequence this could also increase the reliability of in situ extreme wave statistics.

AB  - One quarter of the European Union's coast is currently eroding despite the development of a wide range of measures to protect shorelines from eroding and flooding. The prospect of further sea level rise and the heritage of mismanagement in the past imply that coastal erosion will be a growing concern in the future. The European Commission, DG Environment, has recently initiated a project focusing on policy advice for proper management of the phenomenon "coastal erosion". This policy advice will be addressing policy makers at the European, national, provincial and local level and will build on national legislation and practical experiences in policy execution to ensure harmonisation and feasibility. A consortium led by the Dutch Institute for Coastal and Marine Management (RIKZ) has been mandated to implement this project. One of the aims of this research is to facilitate embedding of lessons learned from existing local shoreline management practices into decision-making processes and make this knowledge easily accessible to a wide range of local stakeholders by producing a Shoreline Management Guide (SMG). The objective of this study is to identify successful and unsuccessful strategies, measures and experiments to prevent or manage coastal erosion at a local and national level for different types of coast, doing a review of the practical experience of erosion management and control in Europe. The information will be placed in the context of the entire spectrum of coastal defence measures and highlight the relationship with integrated coastal management (ICZM). The SMG does not aim at providing predefined management strategies, but rather at providing in depth background information on comparable situations and the strategies that were adopted in these cases. Thus, giving a solid basis for tailoring the management strategy to the situation at hand while avoiding measures that have proven to be ineffective or counterproductive.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2016 - Shanghai Conference Start Date: 2016, April 10 Conference End Date: 2016, April 13 Conference Location: Shanghai, China Storm surge is one of the predominant natural threats to coastal communities. It occurs frequently and usually results in the most serious economic loss among all the natural hazards in China. The disaster induced by storm surge depends on various influencing factors such as the intensity, duration, and route of the passing typhoon, and thus a comprehensive understanding of natural coastal hazards is essential for the safe and sustainable development of the coastal area. Seawalls are the primary coastal protection facilities, and their protection standard can be established using return periods of the design tidal level (or water level) and design wave. But in China, the correlation between tidal level and wave, which is the parameter may enhance the interpretation of the actual storm process, isn't described in the existing design criterion. This paper proposes a new method to classify storm surge intensity based on PBGLD and PBLD. We illustrate this new method using observed tidal level and corresponding wave height series sampled from typhoon processes in the coastal area of Qingdao and Shenzhen, including the occurrence frequency of typhoon, and to make up the defects of the warning water level. A novel criterion is put forward to grade the intensity of typhoon-induced storm surge, and it forms the foundation to evaluate the storm surge intensity for seawall design. Study indicates that the new criterion gives an explicit notion in terms of joint probability that is easy to operate and fits well to the classification of the surge intensity. The proposed method of storm surge classification using new statistical model can be adopted as a reference approach in many coastal areas affected by typhoon. The data used here is limited, it is recommended that the calculation should only be used for reference, and more verification and improvement may be needed for broader application.

AB  - The INSPECT (Integrated Numerical research System for Prevention and Estimation of Coastal disasTer) system was developed for numerical analysis of oceanographical disaster phenomena in coastal and estuarine areas. The INSPECT consists of three numerical simulation models (Wave, Storm Surge and Tsunami models), their supporting sub-systems and supporting databases. With this system, various coastal protection works can be more reliable designed. The paper presents an outline of the design, basic theory of numerical research and applications of the system. The analysis of tide, Wave, Tsunami and storm surge on the coasts of Shikoku Island in Japan is performed by using INSPECT.

AB  - A new scheme of numerical simulation of storm surge has been developed recently. With this simulation model, abnormal high storm surges generated by large typhoons around the coasts of Japan were well reproduced. Furthermore, numerical simulation model for storm surge inundation is developed to study and prevent storm surge disasters on Japanese coasts. Inundation simulation method induced by overflow, overtopping and dike breach is incorporated into this model. According to the results of this inundation simulation, coastal protection works consisted of hard and soft countermeasures can be designed. This paper presents the application to the Nagoya Port in the Ise Bay.

AB  - Over the centuries, London has progressively encroached into the tidal Thames River as it has developed into a “World City”. This encroachment has exacerbated the flood risk to new and adjacent land, despite continual upgrading of flood defences. The pressure for further encroachment remains, despite the new threat of human-induced climate change—that is, the combined effect of (1) increased peak river flow in the winter, (2) more intense precipitation events, (3) accelerated sea-level rise, and possibly (4) more severe storms and resulting storm surges. Costly upgrade of defences is inevitable to manage the increased flood risk, and this has caused a re-evaluation of the Thames Estuary's flood defence program. For the first time, managed realignment in urban areas is being considered as a flood management tool. This offers a range of potential benefits including (1) increasing storage for floodwater, (2) improving ecological functioning, (3) improving riverside access for people, and (4) reversi...

AB  - On April 22 and 23, 1988, Shell Oil Company spilled more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil into northern San Francisco Bay from its refinery in Martinez, California. The resulting contamination of more than 11 miles of shoreline, marshes, beaches, and marinas attracted widespread public interest and extended investigation by governmental agencies and elected officials, as the cleanup extended for many weeks. The regional response team (RRT) was asked to host two public forums to present a unified governmental perspective on the incident and to give the public a chance to comment and express ideas for restoration and mitigation measures. This paper describes how this process was carried out and makes observations on the importance of the SPCC program. Reviewing a regional response to a discharge is a possible RRT activity described in the National Contingency Plan. This effort presents an opportunity for the RRT to solicit public views for use in its evaluation process.

AB  - Tsunami-tide interactions in the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) were investigated by taking into account the effects of tidal currents on the tsunami propagation in terms of the arrival time and the run-up heights along the coast of SIS. The initial tsunami wave profile was introduced by the possible Tokai-Tonankai-Nankai Earthquake of the magnitude Mw9.0, which is equivalent to that of 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. Numerical experiments with four different tidal phases, flood, ebb, high, and low, reveal that the water depth changes due to tides affect the tsunami propagation in terms of heights and arrival time. During high tides, the tsunami propagates faster and reaches higher than during the low tides. In addition, during the flood tides with rising water level, tsunami propagates faster than during the ebb tides. Further investigation also shows that the tsunami-tide interaction changes the tsunami signal such that the tsunami-only spectra shifts the spectral peaks after considering the tsunami-tide interactions. Local oscillation modes characterized by local bathymetry and topography shift to higher frequency modes due to the non-linear tsunami-tide interaction. To reduce the uncertainties involved in tsunami predictions and coastal defenses and management, it is strongly recommended to simulate tsunamis together with tides in shallow water environments.

AB  - Atoll islands' alongshore sediment transport gradients depend on how island and reef morphology affect incident wave energy. It is unclear, though, how potential atoll morphologic configurations influence shoreline erosion and/or accretion patterns, and how these relationships will respond to future sea-level rise (SLR). Schematic atoll models with varying morphologies were used to evaluate the relative control of individual morphological parameters on alongshore transport gradients. Incident wave transformations were simulated using a physics-based numerical model and alongshore erosion and accretion was calculated using empirical formulae. The magnitude of the transport gradients increased with SLR: initial erosion or accretion patterns intensified. Modeled morphologic parameters that significantly influenced alongshore transport were the atoll diameter, reef flat width, reef flat depth, and island width. Modeled atolls with comparably small diameters, narrow and deep reef flats with narrow islands displayed greater magnitudes of erosion and/or accretion, especially with SLR. Windward island shorelines are projected to accrete toward the island's longitudinal ends and lagoon due to SLR, whereas leeward islands erode along lagoon shorelines and extend toward the island ends. Oblique island, oriented parallel to the incident deepwater wave direction, shorelines are forecast to build out leeward along the reef rim and toward the lagoon while eroding along regions exposed to direct wave attack. These findings make it possible to evaluate the relative risk of alongshore erosion/accretion on atolls due to SLR in a rapid, first-order analysis. © 2019 Shope and Storlazzi.

AB  - The German North Sea Coast is relatively short (370 km); its shape is extremely irregular with estuaries, extended tidal flats, partly protected by sandy islands with deep tidal gullies between them. It is of high interest whether the mean height of the tidal flats will rise, if the green house effect results in an acceleration of the mean sea level rise. In that case coastal protection in areas behind tidal flats will have to be changed completely, as then wave energy will no longer be dissipated in front of the coastline and will attack the dikes heavily. So an analysis of the data of the tidal flat heights over more than 100 years and a comparison with the sea level rise as conducted. This may give first indications to the future behaviour of the protective foreshore in times of faster rising water level. In addition, the tidal flats regions provide fisheries, as well as a nature preserve and a health resort. This paper discusses the studies conducted, method of analysis, and analytical results.

AB  - Kakanj is located in the center of Sarajevo-Zenica basin in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Coal mining began in the mid 19th century. Several underground mines in the area of Trstionica started operating after the end of World War II. Subsidence caused by underground mining are almost always localized on the surface above the underground area with a zone of influence within the area of the mine. Vertical subsidence could cause significant problems and economic losses, but also the positive effects on the environment, as in the case of forming swamp Bistrik, occurred over the mining area of the pit named Haljinići. There are three water bodies formed in this area. The largest onecovers an area of 200x50 m, while the other two ones are smaller and waterless during summer time. Marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions. Swamp Bistrik is on the Adriatic Flyway and it is an important place as Stop Over Site in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 250 million European and Asian migratory birds. Swamp Bistrik is under the process of declaration as Category IV (Habitat/Species Management Area) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

AB  - This research aims to investigate the effect which big coastal facilities exert on coastal erosion due to waves in Khlong Wan Coast and examine some measures. Field surveys and a long-term simulation with the one-line numerical model indicated that the blockage of silt-and-sand supply from the northeast side of the coast by a big groin and the blockage of the supply from the southwest side by a huge detached breakwater has caused coastal erosion. Moreover, because the prediction using the one-line model showed that the beach in the southwest side of an old fishing port will become the most dangerous area, some measures for the coastal protection were proposed. Then, examinations on topographical changes of the beach, wave overtopping rates, etc. elucidate that sand nourishment is the most effective measure.

AB  - The reed "Phragmites australis" Cav. is aggressively invading salt marshes along the Atlantic Coast of North America. The authors examined the interactive role of habitat alteration (i.e., shoreline development) in driving this invasion and its consequences for plant richness in New England salt marshes. They surveyed 22 salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and quantified shoreline development, Phragmites cover, soil salinity, and nitrogen availability. Shoreline development, operationally defined as removal of the woody vegetation bordering marshes, explained >90% of intermarsh variation in Phragmites cover. Shoreline development was also significantly correlated with reduced soil salinities and increased nitrogen availability, suggesting that removing woody vegetation bordering marshes increases nitrogen availability and decreases soil salinities, thus facilitating Phragmites invasion. Soil salinity (64%) and nitrogen availability (56%) alone explained a large proportion of variation in Phragmites cover, but together they explained 80% of the variation in Phragmites invasion success. Both univariate and aggregate (multidimensional scaling) analyses of plant community composition revealed that Phragmites dominance in developed salt marshes resulted in an almost three-fold decrease in plant species richness. The authors findings illustrate the importance of maintaining integrity of habitat borders in conserving natural communities and provide an example of the critical role that local conservation can play in preserving these systems. In addition, their findings provide ecologists and natural resource managers with a mechanistic understanding of how human habitat alteration in one vegetation community can interact with species introductions in adjacent communities (i.e., flow-on or adjacency effects) to hasten ecosystem degradation.

AB  - Douro River reaches the coast in northern Portugal, south of the city of Oporto. Although its estuary has been used for centuries as the main thoroughfare for the commerce of port wine, ship access through its entrance has always suffered from safety problems. In the past decades, important morphological modifications have occurred, worsening these safety conditions, and forcing the closure of the estuary entrance to navigation for a significant part of the year. Due to a reduction of the wave shelter, earlier provided by the existence of a robust sand spit across the river mouth, the estuary banks have been exposed to direct wave action, giving rise to flooding and important damages during storm events.

AB  - In a context of continued erosion, as is the case for the northwest Portuguese coastal zones over the last two decades, it is common to find urban settlements at risk along shorelines. To protect economical, social and environmental assets it has become increasingly important to effectively plan coastal defense interventions (beach-fill designs, coastal structures functioning and placement studies, and sediment budgets formulations). The sediment grain size is an important parameter involved in these studies and it should be adequately characterized, however it is common to see it categorized by its median diameter, through a reference value. Beach morphologic features frequently change in form and sediment distribution but these changes in sediment dimensions are not as significant as the differences found for different geographical locations. Alongshore and cross-shore trends of sediment grain size in a given location reflect its cumulative energy (wave climate) and stability (cross-shore profile evolution). In the paper, seeking for a relation between beach profile and sediment distribution, a contribution is given to the characterization of the sediment grain size at some locations along a stretch of the Portuguese northwest coast, between port of Aveiro and Mira beach. Data from three campaigns conducted between 2006 and 2007 was used in the analysis. The observed values of mean median grain size are within the range 0.39 and 0.57 mm in the study site. The mean beach face slope values are between 0.07 and 0.09.

AB  - Troia peninsula, located on the western coast of Portugal, is undergoing tourism development, including construction of a marina. The marina basin was created by dredging a coastal stretch on the northern terminus of the peninsula on the estuarine side, making available beach-quality sediment for nourishment. A study was carried out to identify potential applications and opportunities to place the dredged sand in a beneficial manner. Many variables were considered in the study design in incorporating pre-project beach profile surveys and sediment sampling. Beach-fill design and placement procedures were proposed according to the purpose and constraints of the particular site, while recognizing the implications of the nourishment in a regional sediment management context. Between October 2006 and March 2007, 286,000 m3 of sand was placed along four beach sectors with a total alongshore extent of 1,700 m in the vicinity of the new marina and the TrA3A3ia Roman Ruins archeological site. The emplacements included dune, beach berm, and beach face nourishment, providing restoration of beaches and dunes and also increased buffering capacity in an area of damage to cultural resources of the peninsula. A monitoring program was deployed to assess performance and impacts of the nourishment on adjacent areas, and to identify problems and their causes. The surveys of August 2007 indicate that a significant part of the emplaced sand had been mobilized alongshore promoting the spreading of the fill material to down-drift areas while inducing a general reduction in the beach face slope, and attaining a more natural beach profile.

AB  - Conference Title: OCEANS 2015 - Genova Conference Start Date: 2015, May 18 Conference End Date: 2015, May 21 Conference Location: Genova, Italy The paper gives a brief account of the essential steps integrated and relevant to ocean observation systems, namely: a). development of a series of new sensors and measurement techniques, b). commercialization of the technology, c). implementation of the technology in more than 100 institutions, d). training to the end users and finally e). raising the technology as important part to the syllabus of a few related post graduate courses in university education with the objectives of developing competence among the young generation to undertake related activities confidently. Different types of sensors and observational are available and often times the end users fail to evaluate the suitability of the products matching to the location specific needs at the site. Under such circumstances, many projects requiring measurements in open marine environment are found to fail. In most cases, the details of the failures do not come to surface and hence such failures are repeated. Even though much developments do occur in the basic field of electronics & instrumentation, they do not reflect proportionally in their applied fields, because of the poor interaction and communication with the applied fields. The author describes how he tackled the issue through an integrated approach combining the essential steps harmoniously. The technical contributions are grouped as: a). Development of a series of sensors-many of which with new design concepts, b). A series of data integrators for energy related parameters for better analysis of the environment, c). A series of complex multidisciplinary type data acquisition systems implemented through the commercial firm at many of the prestigious institutions throughout the country, d). A series of national training courses exposing the theoretical and practical aspects of the technology and finally, e). Introduction of academic courses comprising the technical matters in university education at PG levels. The technology developed and implemented in different areas of ocean technology consists of more than 50 different types of sensors and their associated observation systems formulated into numerous projects handled by user agencies. These belonged to different applied areas, namely: Underwater observation of otter trawl systems, Performance evaluation of different underwater dynamic systems, Coastal engg. processes & coastal protection, Marine meteorological & environmental observations, Underwater dynamics around oil prospecting ocean platforms, Propagation of tide and its influence on water mobility and water quality in the associated estuaries, Ship-Borne data acquisition systems, EIA related investigations in port & harbor area, Siltation & sediment transportation in river mouths and Model studies of different coastal engg. processes. Attention has been given to keep uniform signal outputs to the different types of sensors, in order to make easy integration for accommodating different types of sensors into complex multi-signal data acquisition systems. The long practical working experience resulted in the identification of two important aspects to be considered during development and implementation, namely: A. Sensors and observation techniques with location specific features matching to particular environment, and B. Resort to custom designed observational techniques, as far as possible, matching to the objectives of the particular projects. The new sensors and large applications have been elevated to academic levels with new courses as: M. Tech. on Ocean Technology in School of Marine Sciences of CUSAT-Cochin, M. Phil. in SNOM -- School of Naval Oceanography and Meteorology-Cochin, M. Sc. in Climate Change Studies in KAU-Thrissur, and M.F. Sc. in Post Harvest Technology in Fisheries University-Mumbai and in many other professional training courses, in order to build up capability among the concerned to take up the related problems systematicall .

AB  - <jats:p><p>Wetlands are one of New Zealand’s most important freshwater ecosystems. They are low-lying waterlogged areas bordering rivers and streams and forming quiet edges of lakes, rivers, low- lying floodplains estuaries and harbours. In the last 150 years more than 90% of New Zealand’s wetlands have been destroyed or severely impacted by agricultural developments.  The South Wairarapa region, in the lower part of the North Island, covers 2,485 km2 and is characterised by its expanses of lowland plains and lakes, surrounded by mountainous ranges. Once its wetlands provided important ecosystem services filtering nutrients and controlling floodwaters but they are now under pressure from agricultural land use, including drainage, grazing, nutrient runoff and the impacts of pest animals and plants.  For the indigenous Māori culture of New Zealand, wetlands are often regarded as equivalent to organs that cleanse the body (tinana) such as the kidneys (nga whatumanawa) and the liver (te ate), and therefore represent important sites for purifying and cleaning, by filtering or reducing nutrients, chemicals and suspended sediment before it reaches the Lake Wairarapa. Many wetlands have historical and cultural importance as well as are regarded as source of food (mahinga kai) for the Māori tribes, providing important habitats for a range of culturally important food sources such as eel or important flora for carving such as flax, bulrush, tall grasses and bamboo spike sedges. Māori people perceive their own health as directly linked to the condition of their environments.  This study examines how we can re-purpose / re-configure land use within the region to a more ecologically conscious industry, finding a balance between the existing farming and agricultural practices that the region relies on and a recognition to the cultural practices of the Māori people and its importance to healthy communities and resourceful environments.</p></jats:p>

AB  - This paper describes the damages sustained by a small section of the Vancouver, British Columbia coastline during the passage of a storm in December, 1982. This stretch of protected coastline is characterized by varying types of foreshore treatment. In response to points of concern raised by the Landowners in that area, a detailed wave run-up analysis was undertaken. The analysis involved the use of both a parametric wave hindcast model and a numerical refraction technique to arrive at the wave climate at the site.

AB  - Waste oil from an oil recycling facility in Portland, Oregon, was discharged accidentally into nearby Smith Lake. The cleanup effort was hampered by a number of factors, including vegetation in the lake and subfreezing temperatures. The recovery method that proved most successful consisted of washing the oil toward the shore, where it was picked up by rope mop and belt mop skimmers. Approximately 10,000 gal of emulsified oil were eventually recovered. Topsoil was removed along the shoreline to a depth of 2 in. The property owner (the Port of Portland) also required that 18 in. of soil be removed in the area where the oil had entered the lake. New topsoil was installed and seeded.

AB  - The Mississippi River Delta (MRD) has undergone tremendous land loss over the past century due to natural and anthropogenic influences, a fate shared by many river deltas globally. A globally unprecedented effort to restore and sustain the remaining subaerial portions of the delta is now underway, an endeavor that is expected to cost $50–100B over the next 50 yr. Success of this effort requires a thorough understanding of natural and anthropogenic controls on sediment supply and delta geomorphology. In the MRD, hurricanes have been paradoxically identified as both substantial agents of widespread land loss, and vertical marsh sediment accretion. We present the first multi-decadal chronostratigraphic assessment of sediment supply for a major coastal basin of the MRD that assesses both fluvial and hurricane-induced contributions to sediment accumulation in deltaic wetlands. Our findings indicate that over multidecadal timescales, hurricane-induced sediment delivery may be an important contributor for deltaic wetland vertical accretion, but the contribution from hurricanes to long-term sediment accumulation is substantially less than sediment delivery supplied by existing and planned river-sediment diversions at present-day river-sediment loads.

AB  - Meiofauna composition, abundance, biomass, distribution and diversity were investigated for 31 stations in summer. The sampling covered the whole Oosterschelde and comparisons between the subtidal - intertidal and between the western-central - eastern compartment were made. Meiofauna had a community density ranging between 200 and 17 500 ind 10 CM-2, corresponding to a dry weight of 0.2 and 8.4 gm-2 . Abundance ranged between 130 and 17 200 ind 10 CM-2 for nematodes and between 10 and 1600 ind 10 cm-2 for copepods. Dry weight biomass of these taxa was between 0.5-7.0 gm-2 and 0.008-0.3 gm-2 for nematodes and copepods respectively. The meiofauna was strongly dominated by the nematodes (36-99%), who's abundance, biomass and diversity were significantly higher intertidally than subtidally and significantly higher in the eastern part than in the western part. High numbers were positively correlated with the percentage silt and negatively with the median grain size of the sand fraction. The abundance and diversity of the copepods were highest in the subtidal, but their biomass showed an inverse trend being highest on the tidal flats. The taxa diversity of the meiofauna community and species diversity of both the nematodes and the copepods were higher in subtidal stations than on tidal flats. In the subtidal, the meiofauna and copepod diversity decreased from west to east, whereas nematode diversity increased. The vertical profile clearly reflected the sediment characteristics and could be explained by local hydrodynamic conditions. Seasonal variation was pronounced for the different taxa with peak abundance in spring, summer or autumn and minimum abundance in winter. Changes in tidal amplitude and current velocity enhanced by the storm-surge barrier will alter the meiofauna community structure. As a result meiofauna will become more important in terms of density and biomass, mainly due to increasing numbers of nematodes, increasing bioturbation, nutrient mineralisation and sustaining bacterial growth. A general decrease in meiofauna diversity is predicted. The number of copepods is expected to decrease and interstitial species will be replaced by epibenthic species, the latter being more important in terms of biomass and as food for the epibenthic macrofauna and fishes.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Coastal lowlands and estuaries are subjected to increasing flood risks during storm surges due to global and regional changes. Tidal wetlands are increasingly valued as effective natural buffers for storm surges by dissipating wave energy and providing flood water storage. While previous studies focused on flood wave attenuation within and behind wetlands, this study focuses on the effects of estuarine wetland properties on the attenuation of a storm tide that propagates along the length of an estuary. Wetland properties including elevation, surface area, and location within the estuary were investigated using a numerical model of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, SW Netherlands). For a spring tide lower wetland elevations result in more attenuation of high water levels along the estuary, while for a higher storm tide higher elevations provide more attenuation compared to lower wetland elevations. For spring and storm tide a arger wetland surface area results in a better attenuation along the estuary up to a threshold wetland size for which larger wetlands do not further contribute to more attenuation. Finally a wetland of the same size and elevation, but located more upstream in the estuary, can store a larger proportion of the local flood volume and therefore has a larger attenuating effect on upstream high water levels. With this paper we aim to contribute towards a better understanding and wider implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation to increasing estuarine flood risks associated with storms. </jats:p>

The model, known as SURGE, solves the two-dimensional depth-integrated form of the Long Wave Equations using an explicit finite difference procedure, with tropical cyclone surface wind and pressure forcing estimated from an adaption of available models based on U.S. hurricanes. Variations in tropical cyclone parameters as well as the physical characteristics of a coastal location such as bathymetry and details of capes, bays, reefs and islands are accommodated by the model. The accuracy and stability of the numerical solution have been confirmed by a comprehensive wave deformation analysis including quasi-non-linear effects and the open boundary problem has been overcome by the use of a Bathystrophic Storm Tide approximation to boundary water levels. A detailed sensitivity analysis has identified the principal surge generating parameters and the model has been checked against an historical tropical cyclone storm surge. SURGE has been used extensively in the northern Australian region and examples are presented.

AB  - The city of Alexandria is located at the southern Mediterranean coast with a population of about 4 million inhabitants. It occupies an area of about 300 square kilometers, with an increasing demand for development of new land. Alexandria coastal zone suffers from erosion and flooding problems, it also tolerates degradation of water quality due to land-based pollution. The Strategic Action Plan for the Mediterranean countries has identified two hot spots (El-Mex Bay and Abu-Qir Bay) on Alexandria coastal zone. These hot spots have been experiencing a continuous increase in population, development, and environmental degradation. Obtaining a sustainable shore protection and stabilization method which provides environment-friendly coastal solution with less execution cost and duration is an important issue for governors and design makers. One of these methods is the Artificial Submerged Reefs, ASR, which has minimum influence on the environment and sea traffic, in addition to being a suitable environment for the growth of useful fauna and flora. A new numerical tool has been used to predict the sedimentation at the lee of the Artificial Submerged Reefs (Geo-textile Mega-containers sand filling) and its stability. The environmental impacts of Alexandria conventional submerged breakwater, constructed four years ago to protect Alexandria coastline from erosion, is discussed. A comparative analysis between Alexandria conventional submerged breakwater and proposed Mega geo-containers artificial submerged reef is presented. The artificial submerged reef saves fifty percent of the cost and seventy percent of construction time compared to conventional shore protection structure. The artificial submerged reef has also positive impacts on the marine environment. These sustainable environmental techniques will help in touristic development and protection of Egypt coastal zone and will also be applied in light of the objectives set by Alexandria Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (AICZM), Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, Arab Republic of Egypt, 2009).

AB  - We examined assemblage patterns of early life stages of fishes for two major tributaries of the upper San Francisco Estuary: (1) Sacramento River channel, and (2) Yolo Bypass, the river's seasonal floodplain. Over four hydrologically diverse years (1999-2002), we collected 15 species in Yolo Bypass egg and larval samples, 18 species in Yolo Bypass rotary screw trap samples, and 10 species in Sacramento River egg and larval samples. Fishes captured included federally listed species (delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) and several game species (American shad Alosa sapidissima, striped bass Morone saxatilis, crappie Pomoxis spp., and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). As in other regions of the estuary, alien fish comprised a large portion of the individuals collected in Yolo Bypass (40-93% for egg and larval net samples; 84-98% for rotary screw trap samples) and Sacramento River (80-99% for egg and larval net samples). Overall ranks of species abundances were significantly correlated for Yolo Bypass and Sacramento River, suggesting that each assemblage was controlled by similar major environmental factors. However, species diversity and richness were higher in Yolo Bypass, likely because of a wider variety of habitat types and greater hydrologic variation in the floodplain. In both landscapes, we found evidence that timing of occurrence of native fishes was earlier than aliens, consistent with their life history and our data on adult migration patterns. We hypothesize that Yolo Bypass favors native fishes because the inundation of seasonal floodplain typically occurs early in the calendar year, providing access to vast areas of spawning and rearing habitat with an enhanced food web. Conclusions from this analysis have implications for the management of aquatic biodiversity of tributaries to the San Francisco Estuary and perhaps to other lowland rivers.

AB  - An assessment of land use practices affecting wetland functioning in the Kongahu Swamp, Buller District, West Coast, has been made, based on historical and recent maps and information, discussions with local conservancy staff and landowners, and a site visit to the wetland in March 1998. Although quantitative sampling of vegetation and other biota was beyond the scope of this study, a general map of vegetation types in the wetland was prepared from aerial photographs and ground-truth correlation during the site visit. Current vegetation in the wetland differs considerably from that in pre- European time, and varies considerably between individual properties, reflecting different management practices such as drainage, burning, grazing, and humping and hollowing of pasture. Present vegetation within the wetland is a mixture of kahikatea swamp forest, flax-dominated shrubland and rushland, and oligotrophic bogs with a diverse array of dominant species. Vegetation of the Otumahana Estuary downstream of the wetland includes rushland (salt marsh and freshwater seeps) and highly diverse herbfields. Areas of high conservation value remain, including remnants of kahikatea forest swamp, oligotrophic bog systems, and the Otumahana Estuary, which is in almost pristine condition. Conservation issues in the wetland primarily reflect activities associated with drainage and other alterations of the water regime. There has been considerable shrinkage of the peat in the wetland due to drainage, together with increases in nutrient status due to run-off from grazing pasture, and invasion by weeds after burning. There is anecdotal evidence from landowners for increased siltation into main drains and Blackwater Creek, although water clarity and quality appear reasonable at present. There is no visible deposition of fine sediments in the Otumahana Estuary, although a layer of fresh marine sand suggests a recent intrusion near the mouth. Future management options presented stress the need for co-operation with landowners and the importance of determining the desired management outcomes for a large, diverse ecosystem of this type. Possible mechanisms for protecting areas of high conservation value include land management strategies, co-operative management schemes with adjacent landowners, and purchase of some areas of high value. The vegetation changes in the Kongahu system typify those seen in wetlands throughout New Zealand subject to drainage and other alterations to the hydrological regime. Restoration of such a degraded system may be difficult and require long-term planning, and depends on aspects of wetland functioning that remain poorly understood and require further research. These include the development of desirable hydrological regimes, the ways in which wetlands change over long time scales, and ecological processes such as trophic interactions and food web structure. © September 1999, Department of Conservation.

AB  - Coastal zones are different from other spaces and require special attention. Integrated coastal zone management is confirmed as the main needed approach to address the particular challenges of coastal zones. "The ICZM Protocol" mirrors the basic principles and objectives of the EU ICZM Recommendation and it fits in the regional sea based approach that the EU envisages. EU Special attention for coastal zones is focused both to positive and negative aspects, concerning population high density of (people), economic activities of strategic importance, biodiversity, climatic and human impacts, scarcity of space, coastal erosion. Tourism industry and unplanned urbanization induced) negative effects in the last years by depreciation of the natural landscape, water quality, sandy dunes, vegetation and marine ecosystem. In this respect coastal management is necessary based on last EU Regulations and Laws regarding ICZM, WFD and Maritime Policies. Strategic approaches of these are based on: ecosystem approach, sustainable resources use, climate change effects evaluation, sound coastal protection, sustainable economic /job opportunities identifying and creation, cultural heritage conservation and traditional activities development, functioning social and cultural system in the local communities access to the coast - for leisure / landscape, general cohesion (accessibility remote coastal settlements). As Pilot area proposed, "Sinoe -Razim lagoon" is the unique aquatic complex in Romania functioning since 1980 as a coastal lagoon with an unstable brackish water regime, connected seasonally with the sea, nominated in the present as "transition water body with shallow water and sandy substrate" as it is define under the EU nomination and classification. The graphical representations were realized in an application of the ArcGIS data assimilation system. The ArcGIS spatial analysis techniques were developed on representations of spatial data (GPS data / data obtained by digitization) in a plane model / referenced configuration, the results being represented / overlay.

AB  - This paper evaluates the results of two fundamentally different numerical models: DualSPHysics and SWASH, which can be used to assess the ability of coastal defense structures to offset or mitigate the water overtopping and subsequent implications for expected future sea level rise. The models are open source implementations of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and of a non-hydrostatic adaptation of the non-linear shallow water (NLSW) equations, respectively. The small-scale physical experiment of Stansby and Feng (2004) is used to validate and asses the performance of the two numerical models for the case of breaking monochromatic waves overtopping a coastal dike. Numerical and experimental time-histories of water surface elevation are quantitatively compared and numerical velocity fields during the processes of wave breaking and overtopping are analysed in detail. In addition, to further validate the DualSPHysics model, numerical experiments are performed considering the more realistic case of irregular waves using the SWASH model as benchmark. Overall, results provided by both numerical models are generally comparable, although some strengths and shortcomings of each are highlighted. These results can provide guidance in selecting the most appropriate model for a particular situation given specific accuracy requirements and availability of resources.

AB  - Coastal hazards result from erosion of the shore, or flooding of low-elevation land when storm surges combine with high tides and/or large waves. Future sea-level rise will greatly increase the frequency and depth of coastal flooding and will exacerbate erosion and raise groundwater levels, forcing vulnerable communities to adapt. Communities, local councils and infrastructure operators will need to decide when and how to adapt. The process of decision making using adaptive pathways approaches, is now being applied internationally to plan for adaptation over time by anticipating tipping points in the future when planning objectives are no longer being met. This process requires risk and uncertainty considerations to be transparent in the scenarios used in adaptive planning. We outline a framework for uncertainty identification and management within coastal hazard assessments. The framework provides a logical flow from the land use situation, to the related level of uncertainty as determined by the situation, to which hazard scenarios to model, to the complexity level of hazard modeling required, and to the possible decision type. Traditionally, coastal flood hazard maps show inundated areas only. We present enhanced maps of flooding depth and frequency which clearly show the degree of hazard exposure, where that exposure occurs, and how the exposure changes with sea-level rise, to better inform adaptive planning processes. The new uncertainty framework and mapping techniques can better inform identification of trigger points for adaptation pathways planning and their expected time range, compared to traditional coastal flooding hazard assessments.

AB  - A comparative study on climate change and its impacts on coastal aquifers is performed for three Mediterranean areas. Common climate scenarios are developed for these areas using the ENSEMBLES projections that consider the A1b scenario. Temperature and precipitation data of three climate models are bias corrected with two different methods for a historic reference period, after which scenarios are created for 2020–2050 and 2069–2099 and used to calculate aquifer recharge for these periods based on two soil water budget methods. These multiple combinations of models and methods allow incorporating a level of uncertainty into the results. Groundwater flow models are developed for the three sites and then used to integrate future scenarios for three different parameters: (1) recharge, (2) crop water demand, and (3) sea level rise. Short-term predictions are marked by large ranges of predicted changes in recharge, only showing a consistent decrease at the Spanish site (mean 23 %), particularly due to a reduction in autumn rainfall. The latter is also expected to occur at the Portuguese site, resulting in a longer dry period. More frequent droughts are predicted at the Portuguese and Moroccan sites, but cannot be proven for the Spanish site. Toward the end of the century, results indicate a significant decrease (mean >25 %) in recharge in all areas, though most pronounced at the Portuguese site in absolute terms (mean 134 mm/year) and the Moroccan site in relative terms (mean 47 %). The models further predict a steady increase in crop water demand, causing 15–20 % additional evapotranspiration until 2100. Scenario modeling of groundwater flow shows its response to the predicted decreases in recharge and increases in pumping rates, with strongly reduced outflow into the coastal wetlands, whereas changes due to sea level rise are negligible.

AB  - The Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies (NOFO) is responsible for oil spill response, planning, and preparedness on behalf of the companies that are operating on the Norwegian continental shelf. The responsibility includes initial response offshore, as well as coastal protection and shoreline cleanup. NOFO is developing a plan for regional oil spill preparedness to be implemented in 2001. The plan is based on risk assessment and covers planned oil production activities in the Norwegian offshore sector. Previously, NOFO's oil spill response plan was based on authority requirements and recognized standards. NOFO is now proposing a risk-based approach, aiming to identify the need for oil spill response in different areas of the Norwegian sector. The new approach is based on estimated probability of oil spill situations, dimensioning oil spill scenarios, and oil drift modeling to define arrival time to shore, coastal areas at risk, and amount of oil that may possibly reach the shore. The risk-based approach is an alternative to traditional "worst case" considerations and allows implementation of more cost-effective measures.

AB  - The Rafferty-Alameda Project is a water management project in Southeastern Saskatchewan consisting of two dams, a diversion canal, and various mitigation measures. The objectives of the project are to provide flood-control for downstream communities, principally Minot, North Dakota, cooling water for the Shand and Boundary power plants, municipal water supplies for downstream communities in Saskatchewan, recreation, and water for irrigation.The project will allow Saskatchewan to use 50 or 60% (depending on supply) of the water that originates in the basin; this means that there will be less flow available downstream in North Dakota and Manitoba. The need for stable water levels for recreation, an adequate supply of water in the summer months for irrigation, and water year round for the power plants means that the natural distribution of flow throughout the year will be changed to some degree. These changes in the hydrologic regime will cause impacts within the basin.This paper describes the project, outlines its major impacts, and relates these to the changes in the hydrologic regime. The reduction in flow availability during the high flow season will impact on the water quality within the Souris River. The channelization downstream of the Rafferty reservoir will affect the availability of wetlands which are important in waterfowl production; the changes in the flow variability with season will affect the water quality which will have impacts on waterfowl production, irrigation, fisheries, and municipal water supply in Saskatchewan. Because of fluctuation in reservoir levels, the quality of shoreline for waterfowl breeding purposes is not expected to be high. In North Dakota, the reduction in quantity of water available will have negative impacts on the waterfowl and fisheries production characteristics of the wildlife refuges along the main stem of the Souris there. Furthermore, North Dakota could have greater difficulty in maintaining water quality of flows into Manitoba, resulting in probable negative impacts on municipal water usage and fisheries in that province. Expected conflicts between various uses are outlined. The paper concludes that the project has the potential for negative impacts which require mitigation and monitoring, but that overall impacts will probably not be severe, assuming past hydrologic regimes will reoccur in the future. However, monitoring and careful water management will be required to minimize the negative impacts.

AB  - Rapid deterioration of the barrier coast in coastal Louisiana is resulting in a transformation of low-energy, semiprotected bays into high-energy, open marine environments. Numerical models (ADCIRC and SWAN) are used to hindcast, nowcast, and forecast wave conditions along south-central coastal Louisiana. Measurements from across the shelf, nearshore, and bays are also used to shed light on the mitigative ability of barriers on the wave and surge field during tropical cyclones. Along western Louisiana the coast is fronted by a muddy shelf, supplied by sediment from the Atchafalaya River. The cohesive nature of this material results in significant damping of waves, particularly during storm events. East of this area the coast is characterized by shell reefs that have historically been dredged for commercial use. Numerical modeling demonstrates that with the reduction in reefs over time, wave energy in the adjacent Acadiana Bays has increased considerably and is likely responsible in part for erosion along marshes fringing the bays.

AB  - Experiments have been performed in the Shallow Water Wave Basin of DHI (Horsholm, Denmark) within the EU FP7 Hydralab Programme, on large farms of up to 25 heaving point absorber type Wave Energy Converters (WECs). For a range of geometric lay-out configurations and wave conditions (regular, polychromatic, long- and short-crested irregular waves), WEC response and modification of the wave field have been measured to provide data for the understanding of WEC farm interactions and for the evaluation of farm interaction numerical models. A first extensive wave farm database is established. The experimental arrangement and the obtained database are presented, as well as results for wave height attenuation downwave of the farms. For long-crested irregular waves, up to 18.1 % and 20.8 % reduction in significant wave height is observed downwave of the 5x5-WEC rectilinear and staggered farm, respectively. Wave height attenuation is expected to be larger, since in practical wave farm applications WECs will be controlled to extract a large amount of power from the waves, and therefore the array will cause larger wave height dissipation. These findings present the ability to combine the harvesting of energy from sea waves with coastal defence systems, resulting in cost reduction for both applications when WECs operate as multi-purpose devices.

AB  - Hummock-hollow microtopography is characteristic of many freshwater wetland systems. It is comprised of elevated, vegetated hummocks and lower elevation hollows; the latter are usually unvegetated, with reducing conditions in sediments unfavorable for plant growth. This microtopography is also often found in interior regions of brackish marshes, where flood duration is high and salinity fluctuations are prominent. Previous investigation showed this spatial patterning to be relatively stable over time and suggested that these microenvironments are produced by the plants themselves. This study investigates the possible mechanisms and controlling factors of this microtopography and considers the effect of different salinity regimes. We examined microtopographic variability of vegetation and sediment biogeochemistry in two interior tidal marshes, a freshwater- oligohaline marsh and a mesohaline marsh, both of which exhibited fine-scale spatial variability. Within a 2-yr period, the freshwater-oligohaline site demonstrated a labile response of both vegetation and sediment chemistry to interannual variability in salinity and sulfide concentrations, whereas the microscale spatial variability of the mesohaline system persisted. Geochronological assessment of the mesohaline marsh, where microtopographic variability was relatively stable, supported the hypothesis that the formation of the hummock-hollow topography is driven by the plants, rather than developing as a result of underlying physical variability. We propose that brackish marsh vegetation alters the sedimentary environment in such a way as to maximize growth under high-stress, variable conditions. The adaptive advantage of this strategy was illustrated in the accretion rates measured at the higher salinity marsh, which were indistinguishable between the interior hummock sediments and those of an adjacent homogeneous bank marsh.

AB  - This paper will deal with the experiences and difficulties with the installation, the operation and the maintenance of the ultrasonic wave gauges in the Hamburg Harbour Area. Moreover numerical algorithms for the detection and separation of ship and wind induced waves will be given. Besides of wave information at certain points and their analysis, for the design of the coastal protection within the harbour also spatial information of the wave distributions are necessary. Therefore numerical simulations with the wave model SWAN of the TU Delft were carried out and compared with the nature measurements.

AB  - The systematic laboratory investigation on tsunami attenuation by flexible mangrove models was performed in order to improve the knowledge on tsunami-coastal forest interaction. A sophisticated parameterization method, based on structural and bio-mechanical properties of a mature mangrove (Rhizophora sp.), was developed for the construction of the mangrove models under assumption of stiff and flexible structure. The forest model examined in the laboratory experiments consisted of the selected flexible mangrove models, arranged in different configurations, which was impacted by a tsunami-like solitary wave of varying height, propagating in different water depths. Based on the envelopes of max. wave height and wave forces induced on single tree models, wave evolution modes were determined to identify the source of wave attenuation. The results indicate the dependence of wave transmission on the observed wave evolution modes and relative forest width: the highest transmission coefficient is attributed to nonbreaking waves (ca. 0.78 and 0.55 for forest width of 0.75 and 3.0 m, respectively), while the lowest transmission coefficient corresponds to wave breaking in front of/in the forest model (ca. 0.5 and 0.3 for forest width of 0.75 and 3.0 m, respectively).

AB  - Abstract.Disaster management action should be built up through developing metacognitive and action skills. The metacognitive strategy includes aspects of knowledge about when and how to use it by type, specific technique, and response that are assumed related to deal with disasters. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the metacognitive abilities of millennials who are affected by disasters and its relation to disaster management. This study used an observatory exploration and inventory (EOI) method involving 248 respondents in flood-prone areas in the city of Semarang. Data were obtained using a questionnaire-based Guttman model electronic survey as many as 52 statements to inventory metacognition abilities and 48 statements related to actions in flood disaster management. Data were analyzed using Pearsons linear and regression analysis. The non-parametric analysis: Kruskal-Wallis test was run to distinguish metacognitive scores in dealing with food-related problems among millennials groups. For metacognitive awareness, the cognition knowledge was higher than controlling knowledge (p < 0.05). The highest score of metacognitive variables was debugging strategy, which represents a corrective attitude. As described in the value of conditional knowledge, the ability to think fast shows that the millennials are quickly responding and understanding how to act. Most of the respondent actively involved in mitigation and rehabilitation as a volunteer in youth-events such us mangrove planting and cleaning plastic-trash in coastal areas. But, lack involvement of millennial in arranging flood-disaster management make less youths responsibility during the disaster. It should be overcome to create a comprehensive approach to community-based disaster resilience.

AB  - Conference Title: 2014 IEEE/OES Baltic International Symposium (BALTIC) Conference Start Date: 2014, May 27 Conference End Date: 2014, May 29 Conference Location: Tallinn, Estonia In the last decades in eastern part of Gulf of Finland has considerably increased frequency of dangerous sea levels rises. The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that over the past 30 years the number of floods in the Neva estuary increased by 1.6 times. Despite the startup in 2010 of the complex structures protecting St. Petersburg from flooding (CPS), dangerous sea level rises continue to cause damage to coastal areas located to the west of the dam. Increasing number of floods, existing gaps in our knowledge about their nature, force of researchers to continue explore this dangerous natural phenomena in order to develop it more accurate prediction.

AB  - Mongolian marmots (Marmota sibirica) live in colonies that consist of numerous burrows and are considered ecosystem engineers. Although once a common steppe species, marmots are now endangered due to overharvesting, which has led to concerns over the impacts of their loss on other species. The decline of marmots likely affected other species given their importance to the ecosystems they inhabit. To examine the role of marmots on small mammal, we established Sherman traps and drift fence arrays with associated pitfall and funnel traps on active marmot colonies, inactive colonies, and control sites in the forest-steppe and semi-desert zones of Mongolia. Overall, we identified 385 individuals representing 11 species of rodents and 1 species of bat in Ikh Nart and 149 individuals representing 2 species of rodents and 1 species of insectivore from Hustai. We found mixed results between diversity indices and abundance of small mammals on treatment and control sites, complicating the picture. During periods of greater precipitation and resulting higher vegetation cover, species abundance and the Shannon-Wiener, Simpson???s, and evenness indices all changed significantly, suggesting that the effect of marmots on other species varies based on environmental conditions. ?? 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

AB  - The managed realignment (MR) undertaken at Freiston Shore has led to scour around the 14 breaches in the embankment, as well as an unforeseen enhancement in the development of a creek system on the mid-intertidal zone. This was related to the MR being at a lower elevation than the adjacent saltmarsh, causing high flows (3 ms(-1)) into the MR site during high spring tides; this was followed by a gradual release of the water volume throughout low water (0.2-0.5 ms(-1)). The width of the channels in the breaches increased by 15 m over 2 months. The majority of the sediment made available was deposited inside the MR site, which acted as an importer of sediment. The creek system on the intertidal zone experienced an increase in annual headward retreat, from 16 myr(-1) in the 10 years before, to 450 myr-1 in the 16 months following the MR.

AB  - National Marine Sanctuaries preserve and protect unique national treasures in our coastal environments. They are not immune from threats posed by marine transportation accidents. NOAA has been working with the U.S. Coast Guard and state partners to ensure that emergencies in sanctuaries are met with the most effective and protective response possible. NOAA developed an emergency response exercise called Safe Sanctuaries 2005 (SS2005) to highlight NOAA's ability to deliver data, observations, forecasts, and expertise during emergencies threatening life, commerce, or the environment. SS2005 revolved around an 800-foot cargo vessel carrying 200,000 gallons of fuel grounding near Elbow Reef in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Such a grounding would injure coral habitat and historical artifacts and threaten other resources with spilled oil. This scenario provided a setting for integrating people and capabilities across NOAA. The exercise objectives stressed NOAA's internal and external communications, procedures for deploying technical capabilities during emergencies, and the health and safety of NOAA response personnel. The exercise included tabletop component in March 2005 and field operations in April 2005. The April field operations demonstrated observation, information processing, modeling and forecast capabilities from across NOAA. Real-time metrological and oceanographic observation capabilities were deployed at the grounding site and integrated with weatlier and pollution forecasts. A navigation response team surveyed the area in support of salvage operations, providing immediate navigation chart updates. NOAA also joined forces with the State of Florida to survey environmental impacts from the grounding and oil. The information from all of these activities was integrated by a NOAA scientific team supporting a unified command comprised of U.S. Coast Guard, State of Florida, and the private sector. A significant component of the exercise focused on providing training in emergency response management, including the use of the Sanctuaries Hazardous Incident Emergency Logistics Database System (SHIELDS) and the Incident Command System. Training included field staff from multiple agencies, providing an opportunity to build the personal relationships necessary for effective emergency response. A post exercise debriefing helped identify gaps in operational capabilities, areas requiring further research, and training that could enhance future operations. The training, tabletop, and field exercises provided an opportunity to both demonstrate NOAA's operational capabilities and to analyze future requirements.

AB  - The effects of the reed, Phragmites australis, growing in a brackish water lagoon, were studied in relation to the grain-size distribution of the substratum. At the salt marshes near the lagoon, the upper soils from the surface to a depth of 20 cm contained much silt-clay. These fine particles were found to be transferred from the river and fish ponds near the lagoon, and to be deposited when the tidal rhythm changed, that is, when the water current stopped. In addition, the fine particles, which were deposited on the bottom of the lagoon adjacent to the marshes, became resuspended as a result of wind-caused wave action, and then were transported and redeposited in the salt marshes at the flood tide. Since the reeds further reduced the water current caused by the waves and tide, the reeds were thought to promote redeposition of the resuspended matter. In other words, the reeds were considered to protect deposited and redeposited particles such as silt and clay from resuspension as a result of wave action by reducing the effects of waves and wind.

AB  - The systematic process by which an oil spill preparedness plan was developed for SSB/SSPC operations in the South China Sea used local wind, current, and weather data in a SLIKTRAK model adapted to estimate the spill costs and risks resulting from a well blow-out. The model shows that the Sabah and Philippines shores would be likely to be affected, while the Brunei and Sarawak shores have a low probability. The minimum period in which oil will arrive at any shore is three days after the spill, February to early August are likely months in which a spill will arrive at a shoreline. Spills from late August to January are expected to move away from the coast. Mechanical recovery of spilled oil and chemical dispersant spraying from boats is effective from March to September while natural dispersion is enhanced from September to February. The local environmental data and local availability of vessels and resources greatly influence the choice of mechanical cleanup equipment. An ecological marine macrobenthos survey has been carried out in the Sabah and Sarawak coastal waters. The fundamental aim of the program is to develop quantitative data on the current status of selected marine macrobenthic communities in these areas. This data could be used as a reference for comparison against any future surveys so that any environmental effects or modification resulting from oil spills may be assessed. A coastal resources study along the Sarawak coast also was being carried out to determine sensitive areas in order to prioritise the allocation of available oil spill control equipment and resources. Finally, the roles and development of Shell oil spill cooperatives in this region have been based on the tier concept. Under this concept, SSB/SSPC would be primarily responsible for its own spill as the first tier. It is complemented on a reciprocal basis by close cooperation with Brunei Shell as the second tier. The third tier involves the cooperation of the Shell Companies in Southeast Asia-the ROSE scheme.

AB  - Abstract. Climate change can strongly alter soil microbial functioning via plant–microbe interactions, often with important consequences for ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant–microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress – i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem–climate feedbacks in the coastal zone.

AB  - <jats:p><p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>Observation of coastal shoreline changes in the Subang District was conducted using Digital Shoreline Analysis System Program based on the satelite images of Landsat TM from 1996 to 2010. The purpose of this study was to determine the distance of shoreline change. Methods used in this study were field survey and regression analysis of shoreline data. The results of this study indicated the existence of a region experiencing accretion and abrasion. The maximum width of accretion of the coast was 1,051.55 meter while the maximum abration was 1,206.83 meter. Coastal shoreline change in Subang District occurred mainly due to the development activities such as residential construction, altering the coastal mangrove to ponds and rice paddies, and sediment transport from the river around Subang District.</p> <p>Keywords: shoreline, Subang District, satelite images, accretion, abration</p></jats:p>

AB  - Part of the answer is that we have taken preexisting ocean and coastal ecological infrastructure for granted. Because nature has been undervalued, ecosystems with ecological infrastructure values have been gradually eliminated. Sea level rise may also expose some coastal residents to "legacy" pollution from former contaminated industrial sites located in coastal regions that have yet to be adequately cleaned up under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). In the United States, coastal wetlands serve a number of key ecological infrastructure roles by filtering water, protecting against storm surge, managing for land erosion, and regulating climate through carbon sequestration. According to one report, coastal wetlands prevented more than $625 million dollars in property damage across twelve Northeastern states.

AB  - A water temperature study was carried out at eight stations along the Gironde estuary from 1974 to 1977. Results are discussed. The water temperature is constant during the late summer and the late winter, while it increases in spring and decreases in autumn; then the effect of seasonal changes is such that the water temperature variations reach 7 to 9 degree C a month. The tidal mixing effect of the fresh and salted water, which is mainly dependent on the tidal coefficient, causes an important daily water temperature variation (up to 2 or 3 degree C); the increase of tidal coefficients creates a small storage of downstream water below Pauillac, and of upstream water above Pauillac. Water temperature measurements reflect the coming and the propagation of the flood discharge in the estuary. Variations are easy to observe upstream but the widening of the estuary reduces them below Pauillac.

AB  - A current forecast system was set up as an aid to executional operations of the storm surge barrier in the mouth of the Oosterschelde Estuary, The Netherlands. The system makes use of deterministic models (hydraulic and mathematical) and/or time series analysis techniques. A short description of the system is given, as well as an account for its performance. The application of Frequency Response Functions to Forecast (tidal) current velocity is discussed in more detail, the method being applicable for harbours and the like. An average error of almost nil and a standard deviation of less than 10% could be achieved. (A)

AB  - The Severn Estuary in the south-western UK is one of the most tidally dynamic environments on the planet. However, despite this the sediments of the estuary remain relatively understudied with regards to their biogeochemical potential. The aim of this project was to investigate how the constantly changing sedimentary environment in the estuary, in which millions of tonnes of sediment are eroded and deposited over the tidal cycle, affects the prokaryotes within the sediments and the processes they control, and also to determine what effect environmental changes in the estuarine system might have on these processes. The study showed that the sediments of the Severn Estuary have high rates of sediment oxygen demand (SOD) indicating a high degree of organic matter (OM) degradation. However, the sediments have low rates of the anaerobic processes that are expected to dominate in shallow marine systems (e.g. sulphate reduction and methanogenesis), suggesting that most OM degradation must be linked to processes further up the redox cascade. The sediments also showed a lack of microbial guild depth zonation, with methanogenesis occurring above or alongside sulphate reduction. Both of these unusual factors can be linked to the regular re-suspension of the estuary’s sediments by tidal action, resulting in large-scale oxidation and mixing of the sediment column and the suppression of anaerobic processes while potentially stimulating aerobic and dysaerobic activity. This same mixing would also distribute guilds of organisms throughout the sediment, creating isolated pioneer populations with a general lack of competition. Re-suspension is also likely responsible for the high cell counts that persist to significant depth around the estuary, as the mixing of sediment and entrainment of OM would produce high and homogeneous cell profiles upon deposition, which in turn can be linked to the high SOD of the estuary’s sediments. Despite this dominance of aerobic and dysaerobic processes throughout most of the estuary some isolated sites do show increased rates of anaerobic processes, particularly at locations that have undergone significant environmental change. These include fluidised mud pools in the deeper areas of the estuary, salt marsh peat deposits at St Brides Wentlooge (especially within the “activated interface”) and Cardiff Bay, an anthropogenic lake and former mudflat environment which shows significant methanogenic potential. Overall this study has shown that the dynamic conditions in the Severn Estuary promote the activity of aerobic and dysaerobic prokaryotic groups over the anaerobic groups traditionally thought to dominate in shallow marine sediments. However, this promotion is not uniform across the estuary, instead varying with topography/bathymetry and the degree of sediment disturbance.

AB  - The sandy barrier island of Norderney located in the German federal state of Lower Saxony. The north-western part of the island is protected against storm surges and erosion by groins and a seawall which borders the city of Norderney. To determine the loading and functionality under design storm surge conditions, numerical modelling of sea state conditions and hydraulic model tests for the seawall were executed. Overtopping rates of up to 120 l/s-m and maximum loads of 200 kPa showed the necessity to strengthen and heighten the construction. Due to limited space resulting from adjacent buildings, innovative wave run-up reduction wall elements were designed. They limit wave overtopping efficiently and meet the technical demands of coastal defence as well as the touristical needs of an important recreation locality.

AB  - Background and aims-The Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the Indian Ocean coastline from Somalia to Mozambique, are considered by Conservation International to be a global biodiversity hotspot - an area of high diversity and endemism under increasing threat. Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term (coastal forest' has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods - The study area of 18,150 km2 lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 1999-2002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of (dense vegetation'. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results - Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of'dense vegetation cover', which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km2. Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km2, of which perhaps only 400 km2 is moderately-intact dry forest. In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation - Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread (sand forests' of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined. © 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium.

AB  - Precious corals have been commercially exploited for many centuries all over the world. Their skeletons have been used as amulets or jewellery since antiquity and are one of the most valuable living marine resources. Precious coral fisheries are generally characterized by the 'boom-and-bust' principle, quickly depleting a discovered stock and then moving on to the next one. Most known stocks are overexploited today, and populations are in decline. The unsustainable nature of most fisheries is clearly revealed by analyzing all available data. Precious corals belong to the functional group of deep corals and are important structure-forming organisms, so called ecosystem engineers, that provide shelter for other organisms, increasing biodiversity. Yet, their management is usually focused on single species rather than a holistic habitat management approach. This review compares the biology of precious corals as well as the historical ecology and the socioeconomy of their fisheries to improve precious coral management and conservation. The analysis demonstrates that a paradigm shift is necessary in precious coral exploitation, not only to conserve habitats of high biodiversity but also to achieve sustainable fisheries and stabilize a specialized jewellery industry.

AB  - Compared to typical Minas Basin mudflats, the Windsor flat has high water content, (50% vs. 30% wet wt, approximately) small grain sizes, and elevated organic carbon content (0.82% vs. 0.24% dry wt). The two principal infaunal species Corophium volutator and Macoma balthica , are less abundant than in nearby typical flats (840 vs. 13000/mSUP-2 and 640 vs 1500/mSUP-2 , respectively), while Heteromastus filiformis is particularly abundant at Windsor. M. balthica at Windsor grow faster and have a shorter lifespan (6 vs. 13 yr) than at other flats. Compared to other Minas Basin Macoma , the weight of Windsor Macoma increases more slowly with increasing shell size, possibly an adaptation to the more fluid Windsor sediments. These sedimentological and biological characteristics exist at Windsor nearly 10 yr after the start of flat development and show little tendency to approach typical mudflat characteristics. Results indicate that secondary productivity of Macoma and Corophium could be reduced by about two-thirds for at least a decade in existing Minas Basin mudflats that are covered by Windsor-type sediments as a result of the construction of a tidal power dam.

AB  - The objective of this research is to obtain generic relations between attenuated wave heights and various vegetation and topographical scenarios. Subsequently, it is aimed to find out what is the actual cost profit of a dike construction behind a mangrove zone comparing to the case when mangroves are absent. The graphs and formulas developed in this research may serve as a first approximation during feasibility studies or conceptual designs of a coastal dike incorporating mangrove vegetation. They allow calculating the design wave height attenuated by site specific or planned for restoration mangrove forests, for different design met-ocean conditions. Calculated wave reduction coefficients can be later on translated to the cost savings of a coastal dike raised behind the mangrove forests.

AB  - In the recent years, there is an increasing awareness on the important roles of mangrove forests in coastal protection and coastal ecosystems in Vietnam. The country has lost more than 60% of its mangrove area over the last 60 years, putting its mostly low and weak sea dikes into a more vulnerable situation, facing the ever-increasing severe natural disasters approaching from the South China Sea. This experimental study was carried out to highlight the role of mangrove forests in dissipating the wave energy in storm conditions, thus effectively reduce wave load on sea dikes. It showed that with a mangrove forest of average density and appropriate length (about one significant wave length and above) the wave reduction coefficient can be as high as 80% depending on the water level. Again this enhances the necessity of growing and maintaining mangroves in front of the sea-dike as an economical and environmental friendly protection for Vietnamese shoreline.

AB  - TWILLEY, R.R. and RIVERA-MONROY, V.H., 2005. Developing performance measures of mangrove wet lands using simulation models of hydrology, nutrient biogeochemistry, and community dynamics. Journal of Coastal Research, SI(40), 79-93. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The goal of mangrove restoration projects should be to improve community structure and ecosystem function of degraded coastal landscapes. This requires the ability to forecast how mangrove structure and function will respond to prescribed changes in site conditions including hydrology, topography, and geophysical energies. There are global, regional, and local factors that can explain gradients of regulators (e.g., salinity, sulfides), resources (nutrients, light, water), and hydroperiod (frequency, duration of flooding) that collec tively account for stressors that result in diverse patterns of mangrove properties across a variety of envi ronmental settings. Simulation models of hydrology, nutrient biogeochemistry, and vegetation dynamics have been developed to forecast patterns in mangroves in the Florida Coastal Everglades. These models provide insight to mangrove response to specific restoration alternatives, testing causal mechanisms of system degradation. We propose that these models can also assist in selecting performance measures for monitoring programs that evaluate project effectiveness. This selection process in turn improves model development and calibration for forecasting mangrove response to restoration alternatives. Hydrologic per formance measures include soil regulators, particularly soil salinity, surface topography of mangrove land scape, and hydroperiod, including both the frequency and duration of flooding. Estuarine performance mea sures should include salinity of the bay, tidal amplitude, and conditions of fresh water discharge (included in the salinity value). The most important performance measures from the mangrove biogeochemistry model should include soil resources (bulk density, total nitrogen, and phosphorus) and soil accretion. Mangrove ecology performance measures should include forest dimension analysis (transects and/or plots), sapling recruitment, leaf area index, and faunal relationships. Estuarine ecology performance measures should include the habitat function of mangroves, which can be evaluated with growth rate of key species, habitat suitability analysis, isotope abundance of indicator species, and bird census. The list of performance mea sures can be modified according to the model output that is used to define the scientific goals during the restoration planning process that reflect specific goals of the project.

AB  - Tidal wetlands can be important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems, such as the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary. As a result of the tendency of bacteria in wetland sediments to methylate mercury, the restoration of wetland habitat may cause an increase of MeHg concentrations. To balance the need for tidal wetland habitat with concerns over increased MeHg exposure, landscape-scale techniques for minimizing the production and export of MeHg from wetland sediments are needed. One potential approach is to use an iron sediment amendment to reduce net MeHg production. The addition of Fe[II] decreases MeHg production by lowering the concentration of the inorganic Hg[II] species that are methylated by bacteria. In this research, the potential for reducing MeHg production and export via an iron amendment was evaluated in laboratory microcosm experiments and a field study in a tidal salt marsh in the San Francisco Bay estuary. Additionally, sediment incubation experiments were conducted in anaerobic containers and in in situ cores to evaluate the effect of iron and sulfur redox cycling on MeHg production. Two laboratory microcosm experiments (Chapter 2) were conducted to test the iron amendment hypothesis under simulated tidal wetland conditions: one with devegetated sediments and one with live wetland vegetation. The microcosms consisted of intact sediment cores collected from Gambinini Marsh, a tidal salt marsh in the San Francisco Bay estuary dominated by pickleweed (Sarcocornia pacifica). The microcosms were maintained under simulated tidal conditions and amended at four iron doses (0, 180, 360, and 720 g-Fe/m2). Following iron addition to the devegetated sediments, porewater S[-II] concentrations decreased for each dose relative to the control. The average weekly export of MeHg in the surface water decreased by 82% and 89% for the two highest iron doses, respectively. Despite substantial variability within treatment groups, similar trends were observed in the vegetated microcosms. The results suggest that iron addition has the potential to provide a landscape-scale control on MeHg export from restored tidal wetlands under certain conditions. The cycling of iron, sulfur, and mercury in tidal wetlands is a complex process, with the combination of daily tides, changes in the growth state of wetland plants, and a highly productive microbial community resulting in temporal and spatial variations in MeHg production and export. Sediment incubation experiments (Chapter 3) were used to evaluate the effect of these processes on MeHg concentrations in the sediments of Gambinini Marsh. Sediments were incubated for 7-days in sealed jars under the following conditions: untreated sediments, addition of sodium molybdate to suppress sulfate reduction, and the addition of formaldehyde as an abiotic control. Similar rates of Fe[II] production were observed in both the untreated and Mo-amended incubations, suggesting that both iron-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria co-existed in the same sediment layers. Additionally, MeHg production was not observed when sulfate reduction was suppressed, suggesting that mercury methylation was mediated by sulfate- reducing bacteria. The in situ incubations, which were conducted with open and closed cores, demonstrated that during the summer months when plants were active, separation of sediments from live plant roots and gas exchange with the atmosphere resulted in more reduced sediment conditions. Additionally, sediments at the surficial layers (0-1 cm and 3-4 cm depths) exhibited more reducing conditions during the winter than in the summer, suggesting that the oxidation of reduced iron species occurs more rapidly during the summer. To better understand the effect of iron amendments on in situ tidal marsh biogeochemistry, a 17-month field study was conducted in the Gambinini Marsh (Chapter 4). Before and after amending the sediments with 77 g-Fe/m2, porewater from pickleweed-dominated sediments in the high marsh plain were analyzed for iron, sulfur, organic carbon, and methylmerc ry. Sulfide was not detected in the sediment porewater, and the iron amendment had no observable effect on net MeHg production. However, porewater iron concentrations were elevated for at least 6 weeks following the amendment. Porewater concentrations of MeHg and dissolved organic carbon were lower throughout 2010 than during the summer of 2009 when the experiment was initiated. However, these concentrations increased during the period of pickleweed flowering in 2010, further demonstrating the strong effect that wetland vegetation can have on sediment biogeochemical processes. This research demonstrated that an iron sediment amendment has the potential to be an effective control of MeHg production and export in tidal wetland sediments under certain conditions. While the in situ amendment showed no effect in the high marsh plain of Gambinini Marsh, the microcosm experiments demonstrated that a strong effect may be possible in sulfide- rich sediments. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the iron amendment in sulfide-rich field sediments, such as those found in low marsh environments.

AB  - In the California Coast Ranges east of San Francisco, post-3.5 Ma folding and erosion of the Mount Diablo anticline have created unusual three-dimensional exposures of late Mesozoic-Cenozoic stratigraphic and structural relations among rocks of the Franciscan subduction complex, Coast Range ophiolite, and Great Valley forearc basin. These relations offer new insights into the kinematics of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary synsubduction extension, attenuation, and blueschist exhumation within the ancestral California forearc region. Map relations and subsurface data reveal that marine strata of the Great Valley forearc basin northeast of Mount Diablo accumulated in an ... 100-km-long, north-south-trending, extensional graben system. Normal faults in the graben system cut steeply downsection through Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary growth strata and terminate against the Clayton-Marsh Creek fault, which is at a low angle to bedding and is interpreted to be the basal detachment for part of the graben system. The Clayton-Marsh Creek fault in turn is linked to a system of faults that juxtapose blueschist facies rocks of the underlying ancestral Franciscan accretionary prism against attenuated remnants of forearc crust that were never deeply buried, including the Coast Range ophiolite and basal Great Valley strata. These faults are the local expression of the Coast Range fault in this area. Franciscan rocks exposed beneath the faults were metamorphosed at ≥20 km depths after 108 Ma, based on jadeitic pyroxene and 108 Ma detrital zircons (U-Pb) in metagraywackes. Apatite fission-track data indicate that these blueschist facies rocks were subsequently uplifted and exhumed from ... 9 km to ... 3 km depths in latest Cretaceous-early Tertiary time, coeval with the subsidence and extension in the structurally overlying forearc graben system. Much of their earlier rise from ≥20 km to 9 km depth presumably also occurred coeval with graben development, although our data cannot determine this directly. These relations demonstrate that the California forearc around Mount Diablo was in an extensional regime undergoing active sedimentation during major Franciscan exhumation, and thus support models for exhumation of Franciscan blueschist facies rocks via synsubduction extensional processes, rather than via erosional processes.

AB  - In this paper the reliability analysis of sea flood defence systems and the probabilistic approach of the design of the sea flood defences are outlined. The application of probabilistic design methods offers the designer a way to unify the design of engineering structures. processes and management systems. For this reason there is a growing interest in the use of these methods in the design and safety analysis of civil engineering system including coastal flood defences. In this paper these methods are critical reviewed. The so-call probabilistic safety assessment and reliability based design models are developed and applied to a coastal flood defence system in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. An accurate safety assessment of the existing coastal defence system and a set of reliability based solution are, therefore, of large importance for rehabilitating coastal flood defences of the considered case study area. In accordance with present situation and analysis results, the coastal flood defences in Nam Dinh is not strong enough to withstand the actual sea boundary condition and ensure the safety for protected areas in views of present socio-economic development. As part of knowledge transfers, the analysis results could contribute to fundamental base For long-term planning rehabilitation of the sea defences in Vietnam.

AB  - Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated the flood risks faced by exposed coastal areas. These risks will increase due to climate change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of coastal disaster risk reduction DRR strategies and prevention, mitigation and preparedness PMP measures. To this end, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction formulated the Hyogo Framework for Action, and the EU has issued the Floods Directive. By their nature, neither is specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks, particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping, the non-stationarity of surge and flash flood events, and coastal morphodynamic response. This paper describes a set of open-source and open-access methods, tools and management approaches to fill this gap. A Coastal Risk Assessment Framework will assess coastal risk at a regional scale. Thus critical hotspots can be identified for which an impact-oriented Early Warning System/Decision Support System is developed. This can be applied in dual mode: as a forecast and warning system and as an ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the vulnerability. The tools are demonstrated on case study sites on a range of EU coasts with diverse geomorphic settings, land use, forcing, hazard types and socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. Specific DRR plans will be developed for all sites. A management guide of PMP measures and management approaches is to be developed. The toolkit will benefit forecasting and civil protection agencies, coastal managers, local government, community members, NGOs, the general public and scientists.

AB  - The total root strength of two plant species (Spartina anglica and Limonium vulgare) is related to salt marsh cliff erosion in the Krabbenkreek (Oosterschelde). A ranking order in cliff stability is predicted on the basis of these root strength calculations. It turns out that the S. anglica root system is more effective in reducing lateral cliff erosion than the root system of L. vulgare. Also the establishment of S. anglica by germination of seeds is studied in relation to the erosion/deposition rates at an accretion site in the Krabbenkreek. The percentage of seeds washed away depends on the mobility of the superficial sediment which increases with decreasing height above N.A.P. (Dutch Ordnance Level). Above 0.90 m + N.A.P. a germination of 20% is measured, but seedlings survive the winter period only in the zone where a patchy vegetation already exists. It is concluded that generative spread of S. anglica in the Krabbenkreek is not very likely under the present hydrodynamic conditions.

AB  - Seagrasses are declining all over the world, resulting in a substantial loss of biodiversity, coastal sediment stabilization and nursery areas of economically important fish. The seagrass decline has often been associated with increasing eutrophication of coastal areas. We tested possible toxic effects of high nitrogen concentrations in the water layer on the seagrass Zostera marina L., which is often the sole higher plant inhabiting coastal zones in the northern hemisphere. Plants grown in either mud or sand were subjected to various water ammonium and nitrate concentrations, whereby ammonium and nitrate supply were balanced (both 25 pM or 75 PM), or unbalanced (ammonium 125 pM and nitrate 25 pM, and vice versa). We used 2 temperatures, 15 and 20°C. Analyses were made after 2 and 5 wk of exposure. In an additional experiment, 9 pM ammonium and 3 yM nitrate were supplied. An ammonium concentration of 125 pM in the water layer was toxic for 2. marina: the plants became necrotic within 2 wk. After 5 wk, plants in all treatments except for the 9 pM treatment were either necrotic or had died. This suggests that toxicity occurs at ammonium concentrations as low as 25 pM. Nitrate treatment had no effect. Ammonium toxicity effects were more pronounced in plants grown on sand and at the higher temperature. It is argued that the ammonium toxicity effects on Z. marina are expected to be strongest in autumn when irradiance decreases, temperature is still high, and ambient ammonium concentrations rise.

AB  - River deltas are inhabited by over 60% of the world population, and are, consequently, of paramount agricultural and economical importance. They constitute unique wetland envi ronments which gives river deltas ecological importance as well. Additionally, many deltas contain large accumulations of oil, gas, and coal, which further increase their economical value. More than 50% of the world population lives in Asia, most of which on the large deltas of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Chao Praya, Mekong, Pearl, Yangtze, Yel low, and the Red River. The high population density that characterizes these deltas implies a large pressure on the natural resources, resulting in a decrease in sediment supply (dam construction, irrigation works), subsidence (lowering of the groundwater table), and loss of the natural sea defence (destruction of mangroves). Global climate change may provide additional threats through accelerated sea-level rise and changing weather patterns. In South-East Asia, river floods and typhoons are expected to occur more often and as a direct result, coastal erosion and flooding will become increasingly common. Like many other Asian deltas, the delta of the Red River, in the North of Vietnam, is char acterized by an alongshore alternation of irregular but rapid accretion and severe erosion. Locally, coastal erosion has been so severe (exceeding 2 km in the past decades) that entire villages have been lost to the sea; in contrast, the coastline experienced accretion up to 5 km elsewhere. The central objective of my research was to under stand the mechanisms that regulate the medium term (time scales of decades to centuries) patterns of erosion and accretion of the Red River Delta (RRD), and in particular that of the main branch of the Red River, the Ba Lat. The growth of the Ba Lat delta is cyclic, with a barrier that forms alongside the river mouth every 100 years. The present day barrier is about 30 km long. Alternating phases of seaward delta progradation and subsequent development of barrier-spit systems are commonly observed near many river mouths. However, the explanations offered in literature for this cyclic progradation vary considerably. The classical model for barrier development is that developed for the Mississippi delta. In their model, delta lobe switching results in a period of sediment starvation, during which former river mouth sediments are reworked into a barrier. This appears to be more or less the same for the Ebro and the Huanghe delta, but this type of barrier formation may not be very representative of other delta systems worldwide. For example, barriers on the Mississippi form on a retreating delta, while in many delta systems (including the Ba Lat) barriers are associated with actively growing delta systems. In the Ba Lat Delta, there are no indications that there was a change in sea level, wave activity, or sediment supply within the period of barrier formation. Additionally, the evolution of other branches of the Red River delta such as the Tra Ly and Day rivers is also cyclic: the Day River is just developing barriers while the Tra Ly is in-between the Ba Lat and the Day river. It seems that the cyclic growth pattern of the Ba Lat is regulated by internal dynamics of the system rather than to changing external forcing.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability in the intertidal morphodynamic response of two macro tidal estuaries to tidal barrier construction. Contemporary bathymetric surveys of the Petitcodiac River and the Avon River in Canada were compared with historical surveys (1960s and 1860s). Both rivers underwent very rapid sedimentation during construction and rapid infilling downstream of the causeway during the first year after causeway completion. At both sites, there was an unexpected decrease on the order of 90% in intertidal cross sectional area within the first 1-2 km downstream of the causeway as extensive mudflats rapidly developed. Once sufficiently consolidated, these were quickly colonized by Spartina alterniflora. The response of the remainder of the intertidal zone in the two systems has differed significantly downstream of the area of initial sedimentation. In the Avon, no significant decreases in cross sectional area were recorded and seasonal cycles of changes in bed elevation exceed differences recorded between years. In the Petitcodiac however channel infilling continues up to 2 1 kin downstream of the causeway. It is hypothesized that the response of the Avon system is mainly attributable to the connecting St. Croix River and associated hydrodynamics, as well as the position of the causeway within the broader estuary. A significant change in the calculated critical velocity in the Petitcodiac system before and after causeway construction implies that the actual physics of sediment erosion and deposition were altered. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the broader estuary when developing management guidelines.

AB  - Globally, dykelands (former marsh areas protected by dykes) are of strategic importance for climate change adaptation. Many were originally designed to protect agricultural land, yet now protect valuable infrastructure. The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive digital atlas incorporating historical plans, shore protection, coastal geomorphology and LiDAR to serve as a basis for climate change adaptation planning in the Bay of Fundy. 110 paper plans were scanned, geo-referenced and features such as current and historical dykes, aboiteaux (tide gates), armouring, ditches, creeks, property boundaries, foreshore marsh, and geodetic elevations were digitized using ArcGIS. Attributes included age of structure, material, dimensions, and ownership. Dyke elevations were surveyed using an RTK GPS, and individual sections were identified as being vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise. Erosion rates and width of foreshore marsh were calculated per dyke segment. At present, 55% of dykes within Nova Scotia are within 0.5 m of critical elevations established in the 1960s, 2% are more than 0.5 m below critical and all are below the predicted rates of SLR by 2055. There is also a strong relationship between the placement of armouring along the dyke toe and foreshore erosion. Conversely, timely placement of armouring along the foreshore marsh decreased rates of erosion. This was most effective in areas with the largest fetch; less effective where erosion was driven by tidal currents. All data were integrated into ArcReader for use by Agriculture personnel and have been essential for cost effective climate change adaptation planning including dyke topping, hazard mitigation and education. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive digital atlas incorporating historical plans, shore protection, coastal geomorphology and LiDAR to serve as a basis for climate change adaptation planning in the Bay of Fundy. Dyke elevations were surveyed using an RTK GPS, and individual sections were identified as being vulnerable to storm surge and sea level rise. Erosion rates and width of foreshore marsh were calculated per dyke segment. At present, 55% of dykes within Nova Scotia are within 0.5 m of critical elevations established in the 1960s, 2% are more than 0.5 m below critical and all are below the predicted rates of SLR by 2055. There is also a strong relationship between the placement of armouring along the dyke toe and foreshore erosion. Conversely, timely placement of armouring along the foreshore marsh decreased rates of erosion. This was most effective in areas with the largest fetch; less effective where erosion was driven by tidal currents.

AB  - Issue Title: RISK AND MANAGEMENT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE STORM SURGES Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas worldwide are under threat, requiring coastal managers to develop new strategies to cope with land subsidence, sea-level rise and the increasing risk of storm-surge-induced floods. Traditional engineering approaches optimizing for safety are often suboptimal with respect to other functions and are neither resilient nor sustainable. Densely populated deltas in particular need more resilient solutions that are robust, sustainable, adaptable, multifunctional and yet economically feasible. Innovative concepts such as â[euro] Building with Natureâ[euro](TM) provide a basis for coastal protection strategies that are able to follow gradual changes in climate and other environmental conditions, while maintaining flood safety, ecological values and socio-economic functions. This paper presents a conceptual framework for Building with Nature that is used to evaluate coastal protection strategies, based on a case study of the Holland coast in the Netherlands. The added value and the limitations of these strategies are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Since the introduction of the term ecosystem engineering by Jones et al. many studies have focused on positive, facilitative interactions caused by ecosystem engineering. Much less emphasis has been placed on the role of ecosystem engineering in causing negative interactions between species. Here, we report on negative interactions between two well known ecosystem engineers occurring at the interface of salt marsh and intertidal flat (i.e. common cordgrass Spartina anglica and lugworms Arenicola marina), via modification of their joint habitat. A field survey indicated that, although both species share a common habitat, they rarely co-occur on small spatial scales (<1 m). Experiments in the field and in mesocosms reveal that establishment of small Spartina plants is inhibited in Arenicola-dominated patches because of low sediment stability induced by the lugworms. In turn, Arenicola establishment in Spartina-dominated patches is limited by high silt content, compactness and dense rooting of the sediment caused by Spartina presence. Our results show that negative interactions by modification of the environment can result in rapid mutual exclusion, particularly if adverse effects of habitat modification are strong and if both species exhibit positive feedbacks. This illustrates the potential for negative interactions via the environment to affect community composition. © Oikos.

AB  - Historically, the Loxahatchee River watershed included an area of more than 560 km super(2). The drainage basin was comprised primarily of pine flatwoods interspersed with cypress sloughs, hardwood swamps, marshes, and wet prairies. Rain falling on the basin was directed through natural topography into wetlands, treated by natural biological and chemical action, and slowly released to the receiving water bodies, the Loxahatchee River and Estuary and the Indian River Lagoon. Today, approximately 434 km super(2) of the original watershed drain to the Atlantic Ocean through Jupiter Inlet. The watershed still includes substantial amounts of upland, freshwater wetland, riverine, and estuarine habitats, but large areas have been developed for urban and agricultural land uses. Development in the watershed, stabilization of the inlet, and dredging of the estuary and river have resulted in saltwater intrusion in the river, destruction of riverine cypress forest along the river, and upstream migration of seagrasses and mangroves. A conceptual ecological model, in the risk assessment framework, was developed for the Loxahatchee system to characterize the wetland, riverine, and estuarine components of this complex and diverse system. This model was developed as a means to build understanding and consensus among scientists and managers regarding the linkages between ecological stressors and attributes in the Loxahatchee river system. These relationships lead to development of a set of working hypotheses that explain how observed shifts in the distribution of riverine floodplain plant communities, oysters, seagrasses and other key species are related to increases in salinity in the river and estuary that have occurred during the past century in response to changing land use, climate change and water management practices. Basic and applied research is needed to address questions related to ecosystem structure and mechanisms that control the abundance and distribution of plants and animals in this system.

AB  - The Ningaloo coast of north-western Australia (eastern Indian Ocean) hosts one of the world's longest and most extensive fringing coral reef systems, along with globally significant abundances of large marine fauna such as whale sharks. These characteristics - which have contributed to its inscription on the World Heritage list - exist because of the unique climatic, geomorphologic and oceanographic conditions. The region is hot and arid, so runoff of water from land is low, facilitating clear water that allows corals to grow close to the shore. The poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current is an important influence, bringing warm water and generally suppressing coastal upwelling. During the austral summer, strong southerly winds generate the equatorward-flowing Ningaloo Current on the inner shelf - this current facilitates sporadic upwelling events that enhance concentrations of nutrients, which in turn enhance pelagic primary productivity that supports the reef's biota. The coast has experienced several marine heatwaves since 2011 that have caused mortality of corals and probably seagrass, albeit relatively less than elsewhere along the coast. Wind-generated surface waves break over the fringing reef crest, causing cooling currents that tend to dampen warming - although this mechanism seems not to have prevented some areas from experiencing damaging heat, and corals in places that do not receive the wave-generated currents have experienced substantial mortality. Herbivores, from fish to green turtles, are abundant, and in the lagoon, extensive stands of large brown algae provide an important habitat for newly recruited fish. There has been a decline in abundance of some fish. Predictions of future pressures include a weaker but more variable Leeuwin Current and increased human use. The ability of Ningaloo's ecosystems to withstand growing pressures will depend partly on the rate and magnitude of global warming but also on actions that manage local pressures from increasing human use. These actions will rely on continued science to provide the evidence needed to identify the pressures, the changes they create and the ways that we can mitigate them.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the application of submerged rubble mound breakwaters as coastal defence structures. As their defensive ability highly depends on the amount of wave energy remaining at their lee side, the accurate prediction of the energy in the lee of such structures is of utmost importance. Past experiments have shown that the behaviour of rough permeable rubble mound structures under oblique wave attack was found to be significantly different from that of smooth impermeable low crested structures. This behavioural difference has led to the research objective of this present study which is to investigate oblique wave transmission by rough impermeable rubble mound submerged breakwaters using 3D physical model tests. This study intentionally uncouples two parameters, being the permeability of the core and the roughness of the breakwater. Analysing the data of this study shows that the permeability of the core has no visible influence on the structure's behaviour with respect to the influence of oblique wave attack. The fully permeable rough rubble mound breakwater behaves analogous to the fully impermeable rough rubble mound breakwater.

AB  - Global environmental change, such as ocean warming and increased cyclone activity, is driving widespread and rapid declines in the abundance of key ecosystem engineers, reef-building corals, on the Great Barrier Reef. Our ability to understand how coral associated species, such as reef fishes, respond to coral loss can be impeded by uncertainty surrounding natural spatio-temporal variability of coral populations. To address this issue, we developed a semi-parametric hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate long-term trajectories of habitat-forming coral cover as a function of three spatial scales (sub-region, habitat and site) and environmental disturbances. The relationships between coral cover trajectories and fish community structure were examined using posterior predictive distributions of estimated coral cover from the statistical model. In the absence of direct observations of fish community structure, we used the probability of coral cover being above some ecological threshold values as a proxy for potential disruptions of fish community structure. Threshold values were derived from published field studies that estimated changes in the structure of coral-reef fish communities and coral cover after major disturbances. In these studies, fish community structure did not change where post-disturbance coral cover was >20%. Disruptions in the structure of these communities were observed when coral cover dropped to between 10-20% and declines in fish diversity were typical where coral cover ranged from between 5 and 10%. Based on these thresholds values, posterior probabilities of coral cover being above 20% and between 10 and 20% and between 5 and 10% were calculated across spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from 1995 to 2011. At the GBR scale, probabilities of coral cover being above these thresholds remained relatively stable through time. Across years, probabilities of coral cover being at least >20% remained null for the sub-regions of Cairns, Townsville, Whitsundays and Swain but highly variable between reef sites within these subregions, with the exception of Townsville. In the Townsville area, probabilities of coral cover being between 10-20% and 5-10% declined from 0.75 to 0 during the study period. This finding highlights potential sub-regional fish community structure disruptions which have not yet been observed at this spatial scale. As frequency and intensity of disturbance events continue to rise, and consequently, as coral cover declines further, the probabilistic Bayesian approach presented in this chapter could be used to help provide early warnings of major ecological shifts at management relevant scales in the absence of direct observations.

The coastal flood risk analysis aims at estimating the expected value of yearly consequences by coastal flooding for a given time horizon. To calculate the risk all sources of uncertainty are accounted for by using a pragmatic probabilistic method. To calculate the flood consequences for a given extreme storm surge, a chain of process models is used that describe the wave propagation towards the coast, the failure behaviour of the coastal defences, the flooding of the coastal plain and the resulting consequences (economic damage and human casualties).

AB  - If a coastal dike has a crest width of more than say a few meters, then wave overtopping will be significantly reduced due to the crest width, because kinetic energy can be dissipated on the crest and water on the crest can flow back towards the seaside. In coastal towns built on dune belts often a wide-crested coastal dike was constructed as both coastal protection and sea promenade. However, quantifying the effect of such a wide crest on wave overtopping is not straightforward because no empirical overtopping formulas are given in literature for this kind of configuration. Therefore physical scale model research was carried out. Also a simplified theoretical model concept was used based on an energy balance formulation of a single overtopping wave. Combining the scale model measurements with the theoretical model, a semi-empirical formula was developed and calibrated.

AB  - This paper discusses a new type of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) named Seawave Slot-Cone Generator (SSG). The SSG is a WEC of the overtopping type. The structure consists of a number of reservoirs one on the top of each others above the mean water level in which the water of incoming waves is stored temporary. Using this method practically all waves, regardless of size and speed are captured for energy production. In each reservoir, expressively designed low head hydro-turbines are converting the potential energy of the stored water into electrical power. A key to success for the SSG will be low cost of the structure. The wave forces on the main structure can be estimated using experiences from coastal protection structures, but the differences between the structures are so large that more reliable knowledge on the wave forces is desired. The purpose of the work is to derive information on wave loadings acting on sloping walls constituting the structure. The research is intended to be of direct use to engineers analyzing design and stability of this peculiar kind of coastal structure.

AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

AB  - Beachrocks are hard coastal sedimentary formations consisting of various beach sediments, lithified through the precipitation of carbonate cements. The objectives of this contribution are to (a) collate and review information on the reported occurrences, characteristics and formation mechanisms of beachrocks and (b) consider their impacts on the coastal zone. The analysis of the available information has shown that (a) beachrock formation is a global and diachronic phenomenon and (b) the great majority of beachrocks are found in tropical/subtropical and low temperature latitude, microtidal coasts. The cementing agents of beachrocks are composed predominantly of the metastable carbonate phases High Magnesian Calcite (HMC) and Aragonite (Ar), appearing in a diverse crystalline morphology. It has been suggested that cement precipitation in the coastal environment is controlled by: (i) the physiochemical conditions; (ii) the presence of organic compounds and microbes; (iii) the magnitude and distribution of the wave energy along the coast; and (iv) the textural characteristics of the constituent sediments. Various theories have been proposed to explain beachrock formation itself, linking the phenomenon to either physicochemical or biological processes. These theories, however, do not seem to be of universal validity and acceptance, as each is able to explain only some of the reported occurrences. The presence of beachrocks appears to affect beach morphodynamics by: (i) 'locking' the beach profile; (ii) modifying the nearshore hydrodynamics: (iii) changing the porous character of the beach and, thus, its response to wave forcing; and (iv) differential bed erosion at the margins of the beachrock outcrops that can alter significantly the long- and, particularly, the cross-shore sediment transport. Therefore, although relict submerged beachrock outcrops may provide some coastal protection by reducing the wave energy impinging onto the coastline, modern beachrocks may promote offshore loss of unconsolidated beach sediments and buried beachrock outcropping. Finally, the presence of beachrocks may have also significant ecological impacts, as the indigenous (mobile substrate) fauna and flora of the beach is replaced by hard substrate benthic assemblages, which are commonly arranged in hydrodynamically-controlled zones.

AB  - Hydrodynamic conditions in the Oosterschelde have changed as a result of the Delta Project. Engineering works were carried out between 1960 and 1970 in the northern branch of the Oosterschelde. The Grevelingen dam was built in 1964 and the Volkerak dam was completed in the spring of 1969. With the completion of these dams, the northern branch of the Oosterschelde was cut off from other estuaries, and river flow was then regulated by a sluice complex in the Volkerak dam. Between 1980 and 1987 a storm-surge barrier was constructed across the mouth of the Oosterschelde, and two compartmentalisation dams were built in the eastern part of the basin. The storm surge barrier decreased the effective cross-sectional area at the mouth from 80 000 M2 to 17900 M2 . The compartmentalisation dams reduce the surface area of the Oosterschelde basin from 452 km2 to 351 km2. The hydraulic impact of the works is demonstrated with data from field measurements and data from model calculations.

AB  - Estuary of the River Jagir is a gathering place of various pollutants from human activity in Surabaya. To reduce the various pollutants in the area, it can use phytoremediation technique with mangrove ecosystem. Nowadays, many mangroves can be utilized as phytoremediation agents; however its utilization is still limited on the tree-type which needs a long time to grow. In using mangroves for phytoremediation agents, Acanthus ilicifolius that thrives in the estuary of the River Jagir can be utilized. It is thrived in the Jagir River estuary and known as herbaceous plants which its growth process does not require a long time. This study aimed to analyze potency of A. ilicifolius plant as phytoremediation agents for Cu. Applications of AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometric) was used in this study. The results at the study site revealed Cu in water at station 1 of <0.004 mg L-1, meanwhile at station 2 and station 3 was 0.05 mg L-1. Cu in sediments has an average of 44.73 mg L-1; in roots has an average of 20.68 mg L1; in stem has an average of 8.51 mg L-1; and in leaves has an average of 5.75 mg L-1. Results showed that A. ilicifolius can be used as phytoremediation agent for Cu and it has the best potential at the root within a fitostabilization mechanism. As for the conservation of A. ilicifolius, can be used "in situ" and "ex-situ" cultivation.

AB  - Coastal salt-marshes represent an important coastal wetland system. The total area of coastal wetlands exceeds 5000 km super(2) in Jiangsu Province, China, but it is decreasing rapidly in response to the intense reclamation activities and coastal erosion along a part of the coastline. Hence, two types of plants, Spartina angelica and Spartina alterniflora, were introduced successively into the Jiangsu coastal areas, in order to protect the coastline from erosion and to increase the accumulation rate. Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses were carried out for sediment samples from the salt-marshes of Wanggang to determine the sedimentation rate, on the basis of an evaluation of the background activity values and the factors affecting the enrichment of Pb-210. Analysis of a typical sediment column of the tidal flat shows that there is weak absorption of Pb-210 in the silt-dominated sediment. Because of the influences of factors such as storm events, bioturbation, material sources and analytical error, some abnormal data points appear in the Pb-210 record. After ignoring these data the calculated sedimentation rate was 3.3 cm yr super(-1) on average. Based upon analysis of the Cs-137 dating, the rate since 1963 was 3.1 cm yr super(-1) on average, similar to the data by Pb-210 dating and the previous studies. The dating results show that there were three stages of sedimentation, with the most rapid accretion being taking place after Spartina angelica was introduced into the area. The study also shows that at the stage of Spartina alterniflora growth, the accretion rate was higher than on the flat surface with the same elevation without the cover of this plant.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as salt marshes and mangroves provide a promising solution to future sea level rise and increased storminess. The growing interests in understanding and modeling of wave-current interaction with coastal wetlands have increased recently for Natural-based costal protection. The SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) model has achieved good simulating results on vegetation-induced wave dissipation in the condition of pure waves, while the effects of the tidal currents are ignored. A revised formula based on Hu Suzuki, Zitman, Uittewaal and Stive (2014) formulation, in which the influences of currents and an empirical relationship of Re-CD are involved, is implemented into the full spectrum model SWAN. Results show the optimized numerical model has the ability to calculate wave damping due to plants in the condition of the pure waves or the combined of waves and currents. The numerical model can provide a better tool to assess the valuable protection services provided by coastal wetlands. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - Longshore sediment transport in the surf zone plays a considerable role in the long-term morphological behaviour of the Belgian coast. In order to be able to analyse coastal protection measures in the future, a 2D morphology model is developed within the Delft3D software suit using a curvilinear grid which follows the coastline closely. A schematised tide and wave climate is used as boundary conditions for the model. In addition, a constant morphological acceleration factor (MorFac) and the MorMerge online-parallel approach are employed to achieve modelling of the long-term morphology within reasonable computation time. Qualitatively, most major morphological changes are well captured by the model. The modelled sedimentation/erosion is further quantitatively compared with beach erosion/deposition trends of the last 25 years presented in Houthuys (2012). The model still shows a reasonable agreement and its quality is discussed.

AB  - We studied the impacts of anthropogenic changes in land use on the stoichiometric imbalance of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in Phragmites australis wetlands in the Minjiang River estuary. We compared five areas with different land uses: P. australis wetland (control), grassland, a mudskipper breeding flat, pond aquaculture and rice cropland. Human activity has affected the elemental and stoichiometric compositions of soils through changes in land use. In general, soil C and N concentrations were lower and total soil K concentrations were higher at the sites under human land uses relative to the control site, and total soil P concentrations were generally not significantly different. The close relationship between total soil C and N concentrations in all cases, including fertilization with N, suggested that N was the most limiting nutrient in these wetlands. Lower soil N concentrations and similar soil P concentrations and higher soil K concentrations under human land-use activities suggest that human activity has increased the role of N limitation in these wetlands. Only grassland use increases soil N contents (only in the 0-10 cm of soil). Despite N fertilization, lower soil N concentrations were also observed in the rice cropland, indicating the difficulty of avoiding N limitation in these wetlands. The observed lower soil N:P ratio, together with higher soil P and K availabilities in rice croplands, is consistent with the tendency of human activity to change the competitive relationships of plants, in this case favoring species adapted to high rates of growth (low N:P ratio) and/or favoring plants with high demands for P and K. Both, soil C storage and respiration were higher in grasslands, likely due to the introduction of grasses, which led to a high density of plants, increased grazing activity and soil compaction. Soil C storage and respiration were lower under human land uses, except in the rice cropland, with respect to natural wetland. Using overall data, soil C storage and respiration were correlated, indicating that soil respiration was correlated with plant productivity. In this wetland area the impacts of different human land-uses on soil stoichiometry and C-cycle can be very different depending on the activity. Further regeneration of natural communities can be determined by the previous type of land-use.

AB  - As an advanced engineering technology, root reinforcement has been practically applied in the coastal slope protection, but the theoretical study has lagged behind. Based on the geotechnical engineering slope theory and plant ecology, it is still needed to apply new root-soil interaction and mechanical models to provide approaches for the numerical analysis on slope stability. As the plant roots growth is complicated and changes with the coastal rock and soil, it is important to use accurate methods to assess root strengthen ability. According to the slope protection action mechanism of the vegetation and the stress-strain pattern analysis, the model of reinforcement mechanism is established to deduce the general mathematical equation of the root systematic resist-slipping stress to provide a theoretical basis for coastal slope protection design.

AB  - The export of sediments from coastal catchments can have detrimental impacts on estuaries and near shore reef ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef. Catchment management approaches aimed at reducing sediment loads require monitoring to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing loads over time. However, load estimation is not a trivial task due to the complex behaviour of constituents in natural streams, the variability of water flows and often a limited amount of data. Regression is commonly used for load estimation and provides a fundamental tool for trend estimation by standardising the other time specific covariates such as flow. This study investigates whether load estimates and resultant power to detect trends can be enhanced by (i) modelling the error structure so that temporal correlation can be better quantified, (ii) making use of predictive variables, and (iii) by identifying an efficient and feasible sampling strategy that may be used to reduce sampling error. To achieve this, we propose a new regression model that includes an innovative compounding errors model structure and uses two additional predictive variables (average discounted flow and turbidity). By combining this modelling approach with a new, regularly optimised, sampling strategy, which adds uniformity to the event sampling strategy, the predictive power was increased to 90%. Using the enhanced regression model proposed here, it was possible to detect a trend of 20% over 20 years. This result is in stark contrast to previous conclusions presented in the literature.

AB  - The Schwedeneck-See oil field is the first offshore exploration and production operation to be developed in German waters. Due to the close proximity to the shore of the two fixed and unmanned production platforms, there is a strong emphasis on protective and preventive measures against pollution damage to the heavily wed beaches and nearshore waters. This paper reviews the important features of a sensitivity study and shoreline-mapping project conducted as part of the contingency arrangements for coastal protection along 62 km of the Baltic Sea. "Sensitive areas" were identified according to coastal use, and areas of risk highlighted on the basis of oil spill trajectories. The main shore types were classified on a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of potential vulnerability to oil spill damage and anticipated difficulties for access and cleanup operations.

AB  - Wetlands and floodplains are unique landscape positions where the presence and actions of water creates unique landforms and soil properties. Land managers have a critical need for accurate maps of these landscapes for purposes such as land use planning, and restoration planning and design. In addition, there is a growing need for the development of wetland assessment models for wetland mitigation where hydrologic and biogeochemical functions are evaluated. Finally, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has embarked on a comprehensive effort to define ecological sites for the Ecological Site Description (ESD) project. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful tools for use in correlating multiple data sources to create boundaries that separate floodplains and wetlands from adjacent landscape positions. However, the challenge is to define wetlands and floodplains according to a robust system that uses the attributes available for GIS analysis. The use of the Hydrogeomoprhic (HGM) wetland classification system is presented as a superior classification system for wetland and floodplain mapping. The HGM system incorporates all wetlands and floodplains into a comprehensive system under 7 broad classes: Riverine, Depression, Mineral Flats, Organic Flats, Slope, Lacustrine Fringe, and Estuarine Fringe. These classes are defined by 3 parameters: Landscape Position, Dominant Water Source, and Hydrodynamics. This system is especially well suited for use with GIS tools because the 3 parameters can be correlated with attributes in soil, elevation, and land use and cover layers. In addition, HGM incorporates the extent of floodplains into the Riverine HGM wetland class, so there is no separation between the definition of “wetland” and “floodplain”. The following GIS mapping examples using soil attributes are presented: The use of Soil Survey Geogrpahic (SSURGO) database attributes including geomorphic description, taxonomy, water features, and physical properties. In addition, examples are presented illustrating the use of elevation data to extract: watershed boundary, and Strahler Stream Order. The use of soils data alone is limited to efforts where individual soil map units can be used to delineate wetland boundaries. However, spatial analyst tools can be used to delineate wetland boundaries within soil map units. Taken together, these processes can be combined to create reasonably accurate delineations of wetland landscape positions ready for ground truthing. Successful map projects are defined as those where mapped wetland HGM class boundaries match neatly with adjacent non-wetlands, and class boundaries match neatly with adjacent transitional wetland classes. Wetlands are mapped as landscapes including the non-wetland areas which are an integral part of the system . As such, the boundaries do not define jurisdictional wetlands. For instance, the Riverine class includes non-hydric soils found on natural levees and other depositional features. Depression wetlands are mapped in a complex which include the critical upland areas between individual depressions. Slope HGM classes nearly always transition into adjacent HGM classes.

AB  - Weisner, E. and Schernewski, G. 2013. Adaptation to climate change: A combined coastal protection and re-alignment measure in a southern Baltic tourism region. The German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has an outer Baltic coastline of 354 km of which 70 is subject to erosion with an average retreat of 0.34 m/yr. Altogether 135 km of coastline is protected by wooden groynes, beach and dune nourishment, protective dunes and forests, dykes, seawalls and breakwaters at an annual maintenance cost of about 15.5 mio . During the last decades the sea level rose at a rate of 1.2 mm/yr and an accelerated rate of rise is likely in future. A combined coastal protection and managed re-alignment scheme was implemented in an area of about 1000 ha, which aimed to adapt to the challenges associated with climate change, to reduce costs for coastal protection and to support environmentally sustainable development. The scheme covers 6 km of coastline comprising the seaside resort Markgrafenheide and the wetland and coastal moor Htelmoor. We provide here the historic background to the area, document the scheme planning and implementation process, and evaluate the approach and success of the scheme. From an implementation and coastal and environmental protection perspective, the project was successful. Despite early public information and participation in planning of the scheme, a strong local opposition and a negative public perception developed which enforced modifications of the scheme.

AB  - ABSTRACT Weisner, E. and Schernewski, G. 2013. Adaptation to climate change: A combined coastal protection and re-alignment measure in a southern Baltic tourism region. The German federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has an outer Baltic coastline of 354 km of which 70% is subject to erosion with an average retreat of 0.34 m/yr. Altogether 135 km of coastline is protected by wooden groynes, beach and dune nourishment, protective dunes and forests, dykes, seawalls and breakwaters at an annual maintenance cost of about 15.5 mio €. During the last decades the sea level rose at a rate of 1.2 mm/yr and an accelerated rate of rise is likely in future. A combined coastal protection and managed re-alignment scheme was implemented in an area of about 1000 ha, which aimed to adapt to the challenges associated with climate change, to reduce costs for coastal protection and to support environmentally sustainable development. The scheme covers 6 km of coastline comprising the seaside resort Markgrafenheide and the w...

AB  - Coastal protection of land reclamation areas is often composed of rock or otherwise permeable material. Wave-induced setup inside permeable structures can be a problem for land reclamation areas if the design land level is too low. Wave-induced setup has not been studied extensively. In this study we use COMFLOW, a numerical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations employing the Volume-Of-Fluid method to displace the free surface, to quantify wave-induced setup inside permeable structures. The results are summarized in a conceptual design formula to determine wave-induced setup as a function of wave height Hm0 and rock diameter Dn50.

AB  - This paper describes a demonstration effort to stabilize a reservoir shoreline, Rice Reservoir, with wetland plants by use of bioengineering methods. This effort, in turn, would stabilize a jeopardized archeological site being eroded by wave action and human disturbances. Methods used to stabilize the site incorporated both emergent aquatic plants and willow species behind such measures as branchbox breakwaters and in between encapsulated soil lifts (vegetated geogrids) and into or between coir geotextile rolls. Log breakwaters were also employed to deflect wave action and encourage sedimentation. Some methods worked better than others and some failed all together.

AB  - Sea level rise is causing shoreline erosion, increased coastal flooding, and marsh vulnerability to the impact of storms. Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans. Specific climate change adaptive actions and monitoring plans are described and include shoreline stabilization, restoring marsh drainage, increasing marsh elevation, and enabling upland marsh migration. The CCAS provides a framework and methodology for successfully managing coastal systems faced with deteriorating habitat, accelerated sea level rise, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns.

AB  - We studied six barrier beach wetlands in western Lake Superior, six drowned-river-mouth wetlands along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and six open shoreline wetlands in Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Plant, fish, and invertebrate communities were sampled in each wetland. The resulting data were assessed in various forms against gradients of human disturbance to identify potential metrics that could be used in IBI development. Our results suggested that the metrics proposed as potential components of an IBI for barrier beach wetlands of Lake Superior held promise. The metrics for Lake Michigan drowned-river-mouth wetlands were inconsistent in identifying gradients of disturbance; those for Lake Huron open embayment wetlands were yet more inconsistent. Despite the potential displayed by the Lake Superior results within the year sampled, we concluded that an IBI for use in Great Lakes wetlands would not be valid unless separate scoring ranges were derived for each of several sequences of water-level histories. Variability in lake levels from year to year can produce variability in data and affect the reproducibility of data collected, primarily due to extreme changes in plant communities and the faunal habitat they provide. Substantially different results could be obtained in the same wetland in different years as a result of the response to lake-level change, with no change in the level of human disturbance. Additional problems included limited numbers of comparable sites, potential lack of undisturbed reference sites, and variable effects of different disturbance types. We also evaluated our conclusions with respect to hydrologic variability and other major natural disturbances affecting wetlands in other regions. We concluded that after segregation of wetland types by geographic, geomorphic, and hydrologic features, a functional IBI may be possible for wetlands with relatively stable hydrology. However, an IBI for wetlands with unpredictable yet recurring influences of climate-induced, long-term high water periods, droughts, or drought-related fires or weather-related catastrophic floods or high winds (hurricanes) would also require differing scales of measurement for years that differ in the length of time since the last major natural disturbance. A site-specific, detailed ecological analysis of biological indicators may indeed be of value in determining the quality or status of wetlands, but we recommend that IBI scores not be used unless the scoring ranges are calibrated for the specific hydrologic history pre-dating any sampling year.

AB  - A storm that occurred close to the spring tidal maxima in March 2013 resulted in beach lowering and cliffrecession of c. 5 m along a 110 m frontage at Hopton-on-Sea, UK and threatened the static caravan park of Bourne Leisure Ltd. This paper reports a study using XBeach and MIKE21 models to assist with the design of new coastal defences to reduce cliffand beach erosion. Two schemes are examined here: three fishtail rock groynes (Scheme 1); and ten 'double-head' curved rock groynes (Scheme 2). The selected design must provide acceptable level of protection and, to be granted consent, no adverse environmental impact must be demonstrated. Current practice using a single numerical model can provide a cost-effective tool for coastal defence assessments. However, the work presented here show that when good agreement between complementary models can be demonstrated, greater confidence can be given to model results. Specifically, refinements to the present scheme design were made possible by the use of the XBeach model, which allowed identification of the cross-shore limits of sediment transport in storm conditions, and by the MIKE21 model which allowed quantification of alongshore scheme impacts. Together, the model results have assisted the development of an improved final scheme design which minimizes potential environmental impacts.

AB  - Bypassing and backpassing both involve significant dredging operations. In backpassing, beaches are replenished by offshore dredging, usually with conventional dredgers. Bypassing is typically employed to move sand supplied by littoral drift across an estuary or harbour entrance, thus preventing excessive erosion at the updrift side and erosion in the downdrift region. Fixed dredge plant and pipelines are often proposed for bypassing, Both bypassing and backpassing generally involve hydraulic suction dredging, often from considerable depths. At the.. dredging depths pumps must be set well below water surface level to avoid cavitation, and the required. depth increases with solids concentration. For fine sands and velocities well above the limit of deposition, pump settings can be calculated approximately by the equivalent fluid model. For other cases more sophisticated modeling is required. The example calculations given in the paper show that for sand-water flows, enlarged or sloping suction piping generally does not reduce the likelih~ of pump cavitation. However, submerged reeder pumps can be useful in this regard, for example centrifugal ladder pumps on dredgers used for backpassing. For bypassing plants, either a very deep single pump or multiple feeder pumps are possibilities. It is desirable to have these feeder pumps (probably jet pumps) discharge to an open sump before the main pump. This arrangement enhances stability and can increase sand concentration, leading to improved system efficiency.

AB  - This paper presents the influence of aeolian sediment transport on the initial morphological evolution of beach and dunes at the man-made dune system ‘Hondsbossche Dunes’ at the Dutch coast. In total 35 million m3 dredged material was used for the construction of a beach, dune and foreshore system. This study focused on differences in morphological response within the five different realized dune profile types. A conceptual framework was developed, based on the assessment of (1) environmental forcing, (2) sediment supply from aeolian and marine sources and (3) dune types. These three components were quantified from an analysis of measured profile evolution and the application of an aeolian sediment transport model for the first 19 months since the project delivery date in May 2015. Morphological changes were most pronounced in the first seven months after construction. Dune growth of a profile type at this location is determined by a temporal and alongshore variability in local processes that determines the aeolian sediment supply towards the dunes and the dune geometry that determines the capacity of the profile type to capture the sediments. The model simulations managed to qualitatively reproduce alongshore variations in dune growth as a result of spatial variations in sediment availability, grain size, profile shape and interaction with vegetation. Overall, this study shows the relevance of both marine and aeolian processes in such man-made dynamic systems that are comparable to natural systems. Continuing the monitoring and modelling of this system will improve the quantitative knowledge for design optimization of the Building with Nature philosophy. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

AB  - The Halligen in the Northfrisian part of the UNESCO - World Natural Heritage Wadden Sea are exposed to extreme storm surges due to climate change and sea level rise. Existing coastal protection measures in this area do not consider the future sea state and are mainly based on tradition and expert knowledge. The presented work is part of the project ZukunftHallig (supported by the German Coastal Engineering Research Council) and has the main objective to design and evaluate new coastal protection techniques and management strategies for the Halligen. With numerical simulations hydrological parameters are investigated. Furthermore sensitivity analyses expose possible variations in future storm surges and illustrate the difference in significant wave heights for varying wind climates. This risk based approach of the project is a suitable way to ensure life for future generations on these islands under sustainable ecological und economic conditions.

AB  - The Northfrisian Halligen are small undiked marsh islands and located in the German part of the UNESCO - World Natural Heritage Wadden Sea. The houses of the inhabitants are built on dwelling mounds and during storm events these mounds are the only places which are not inundated on the islands. With respect to climate change and related changes in mean and extreme water levels, new coastal protection measures and strategies have to be developed. At the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (IWW) of the RWTH Aachen University different tools are used to evaluate and to develop new coastal protection measures and strategies for these islands. Within this project several new coastal protection measures and strategies for the Hallig islands have been developed and existing protection measures have been technically and economically evaluated. In addition, social accompanying measures were set-up to rise flood awareness and acceptance.

AB  - Floods from land runoff, principally the Burdekin River, created buoyant freshwater plumes along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. From Cape Upstart near the Burdekin River mouth, to Innisfail 250 km north, no evidence was found of these plumes directly reaching the Great Barrier Reef. Small buoyant patches, detached from the river plumes, found further offshore might reach the Great Barrier Reef. Classical estuarine circulation in the lagoon, even in flood conditions, and tidal flushing by the ocean do not appear to be significant compared to advective processes.

AB  - Coastal geomorphology in the Nakdong River Delta, South Korea, has conspicuously changed partly by human activities and partly by natural processes. In this study, we discuss the characteristics of SAR data over the coastal region and an efficient approach to detect coastal geomorphologic change in the study area. Eight data sets were collected over the study area including four SAR images. Although SAR images are very useful to detect coastal change, speckle noise in SAR images is, however, a serious problem in this application. A weighted averaging process of multiple SAR data sets in the wavelet domain effectively reduces the speckle in the RADARSAT SAR fine beam mode image. The speckle reduced SAR image is then combined with optical data such as Landsat TM or MSS to evaluate the morphologic changes in the coastal region. The straight comparison of optical and SAR data is not efficient mainly because of differences in resolution. Instead of that, optical and SAR data fusion through the Brovey transform enhances the geomorphologic changes in the coastal area. Through the approach, we have successfully delineated the geomorphologic changes made by natural processes and human activities over the study area. In short, the SAR data acquired in different resolutions and incidence angles are very promising to monitor geomorphologic changes in coastal regions when they are combined with optical remote sensing data.

AB  - We used historical flood plume extent data (modelled) to quantify the typical spatial extent of the summer runoff-seawater mixing zone of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Spatially explicit analysis of the variability of in situ chlorophyll a concentrations (observed) across the runoff-seawater mixing zone, then allowed us to explore regional differences in the nutrient enrichment impact of runoff events from the various river systems that drain the GBR catchment. We demonstrate the existence of a discernable north-south gradient along the length of the GBR, such that for equivalent runoff:seawater dilutions ratios, lower levels of nutrient enrichment (as indicated by chlorophyll a observations) result from the river systems that drain the relatively undisturbed northern areas of the GBR catchment, compared to more human-impacted central and south areas. We identify a strong correlation between this north-south enrichment gradient and the flood concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) entrained by the various river systems. By substituting the nutrient enrichment characteristics of the human-impacted river discharges with those of the undisturbed northern rivers, we provide a means to compare the short-term enriching footprint for existing runoff intrusions with those that are likely to have occurred under pre-European catchment conditions. We demonstrate that under pre-European conditions, the nutrient enriching impact from river runoff was likely to have been largely constrained within 1-2 km of the coast, whereas existing conditions support the impact of reefs some 20-30 km off the coast. By using the developed spatial relations, we show that for the heavily human-impacted river systems, reductions in the end-of-river concentrations of DIN in the order 50-80% are needed in order to restore parity with pre-European conditions. We discuss these results in regard to developing end-of-catchment water quality targets for the region.

AB  - Short-term hydrodynamic predictions may not fully answer questions relating to the estuary wide consequences resulting from the implementation of a managed realignment scheme. Specifically questions such as sustainability and the loss of existing habitats are difficult to answer. A Regime application has been successfully applied to consider the long-term (decades to centuries) impacts of a potential managed realignment site within a UK estuary. As well as demonstrating the effectiveness of a Regime application to a managed realignment scheme, this work has demonstrated that the placement of such schemes can results in a significant alteration in water levels and estuary morphology which have a significant impact on existing intertidal habitats. The application of the Regime model with the various scheme placements demonstrates the need to fully understand the gains and losses attributed to the placement of managed realignments within the wider estuarine environment. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Raw sewage and industrial waste have been dumped into sensitive estuaries, bays, and sounds for centuries. The full extents of the resulting sludge deposits are largely unknown, because they move in response to tidal and long-shore currents, and because they are often buried by younger inert sediments. USGS field and laboratory measurements of toxic mine waste and organic effluent samples suggest that anthropogenic wastes typically contain finely-divided metal and metal-sulfide particles. The anoxic environment provided by anthropogenic wastes promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, creating a self-reducing environment. We suggest that the finely-divided metal and metal-sulfide particles are the products of bacterial reduction and precipitation. The fine-grained metallic precipitates are ideal targets for a surface-effect electrochemical detection methodology called Induced Polarization (IP). A USGS-patented (1998/2001) marine IP streamer technology has recently been commercialized and used to map “black smoker” sulfide deposits and their disseminated halos in the Bismarck Sea (2005), and titanium-sand deposits offshore of South Africa (2007). The marine induced polarization system can do this mapping in three dimensions, more rapidly (it is towed at 3 knots) , and with far higher resolution that land-based measurements or vibracoring. Laboratory-scale studies at the USGS suggest that anthropogenic wastes may display a specific multi-frequency IP spectral signature that may be applicable to waste-deposit mapping.

AB  - In order to facilitate engineering design and coastal flooding protection, the potential storm surge induced by a typhoon is studied. Using an unstructured mesh, a coupled model which combines the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and simulating waves nearshore (SWAN) model is applied to analyze the storm surge and waves on the coast of Jiangsu Province. The verifications of wind velocity, tidal levels and wave height show that this coupling model performs well to reflect the characteristics of the water levels and waves in the studied region. Results show that the effect of radiation stress on storm surge is significant, especially in shallow areas such as the coast of Jiangsu Province and the Yangtze estuary. By running the coupled model, the simulated potential flooding results can be employed in coastal engineering applications in the Jiangsu coastal area, such as storm surge warnings and extreme water level predictions. ©, 2014, Southeast University.

AB  - River engineering in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system and changing land use practices in the Upper Mississippi River Basin have reduced sediment loads and modified sediment distribution to the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Concurrently, the Louisiana Gulf coast has been subject to the highest rate of relative sea-level rise of any region in the United States. This study investigated suspended sediment transport and delivery from the Atchafalaya River, a 187-km-long river-swamp system that carries about 30% of the Mississippi River's water into the Gulf of Mexico. The study modelled long-term (1975―2004) riverine sediment fluxes, assessed land area changes in the Atchafalaya Bay, and analysed the relationship between riverine sediment supply and the delta fan process. The study showed a sediment inflow of 6.4 x 10 7 tonnes year -1 and a sediment outflow of 5.8 x 10 7 tonnes year -1 in the Atchafalaya. Seasonally, sediment loads were highest in the spring and lowest in the late summer, corresponding to the river's hydrologic conditions. For the past 30 years, the Atchafalaya retained 9% of the inflow sediment, which is considerably lower than the double-digit percentage rates of deposition reported for the period from the 1930s to the 1960s. Satellite image analyses found rapid land accretion in the Atchafalaya Bay during the past two decades. Much of the newly created land area was quickly vegetated, stabilizing the small delta lobes against sediment resuspension.

AB  - The effect of nine Tween surfactants (polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters) on methanogenesis and the microbial reductive dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was examined using three anaerobic, HCB- dechlorinating mixed cultures, one glucose fed and two lactate fed, that were derived from contaminated estuarine sediments. The two lactate-fed cultures differed significantly in their metabolic activity, especially with respect to the rate and extent of HCB reductive dechlorination. The objective of the study was to screen and select biologically compatible surfactants for use in subsequent research on surfactant-enhanced bioavailability of sorbed-phase chlorinated organic contaminants. Addition of the Tween surfactants resulted in lower rates of methanogenesis and HCB dechlorination compared with the control (i.e., surfactant-free culture) for both the glucose-fed culture and the lactate-fed culture, which exhibited a high metabolic activity. Tween-61 and -65 exhibited the lowest inhibition of HCB dechlorination at initial surfactant concentrations of 200 and 1,000 mg/L. Oil the other hand, the Tween surfactants, especially Tween-81 and -85, enhanced the rates of both methanogenesis and HCB dechlorination when the low metabolic activity lactate-fed culture was used. The observed rate enhancements may be attributed to bacterial cell membrane modification by the surfactants. Attempts to correlate methanogenesis rates to surfactant properties (such as the hydrophile-lipophile balance number, fatty acid carbon chain length, and the number of ethylene oxide groups) were not successful. In general, increased surfactant concentrations resulted in lower rate and extent of HCB dechlorination. Although HCB dechlorination was completely inhibited at a surfactant concentration of 1,000 mg/L, the extent of methanogenesis was not affected. Results from this study demonstrate that despite compositional similarities among the Tween surfactants, their effects on biological activities, such as methanogenesis and reductive dechlorination, can differ significantly.

AB  - Dynamic characteristics and wave attenuation mechanism of flexible vegetation is fundamental to ocean engineering and nature-based coastal defense solutions. Based on simulation results by the flexible vegetation dynamic model, relative water depth, wave height, wave period and vegetation elastic modulus have noteworthy influences on submerged flexible vegetation dynamics. Meanwhile, simulation results by the coupled XBeach + FVDM model indicate that increasing vegetation distribution density and length can result in larger wave attenuation under the present investigation conditions. The findings of this research provide insights for flexible vegetation dynamic characteristics and resulting wave attenuation mechanism. © 2022 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - A two-stage saltmarsh restoration approach is proposed. The eroded steep coast will be protected by lifting the seabed level in two steps, firstly slowing down the flow velocity and initially increasing the bottom elevation, and secondly establishing a tidal flat for saltmarsh development. The approach is implemented in a typical eroded coast in Hangzhou Bay and the effects of the engineering design are simulated by numerical model TELEMAC. It is shown that after the project is completed, the previous erosion state in the local area is radically altered and a tidal flat of 90m width can be restored. The effectiveness of the project is discussed. © 2022 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - The process of sediment transport has a very complex mechanism due to waves, currents and bottom topography changes. Usually, beach erosion occurs from various causes such as non-equilibrium sediment transport condition, construction of seawall and rip currents. Therefore, the main mode and direction of sediment transport that causes beach erosion should determined to reduce and develop countermeasures for beach erosion. In this study, the process of sediment transport on Jeoncheon-Najeong Beach and main causes of beach erosion have been studied. In addition, countermeasures are planned for reducing the beach erosion. Field investigation data, aerial photos, and the results of numerical and movable hydraulic model tests were used in the analysis. As a result, it was realized that the main causes of beach erosion at Jeoncheon-Najeong Beach were due to the construction of fishery harbors and a seawall. The construction of artificial reef, net process, and hydrophilic shore protection were suggested in order to solve the problems of beach erosion. Also, the effectiveness of the countermeasures has been thoroughly examined by using numerical and hydraulic model tests. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - The glaciomarine sedimentary record of the fjord head (Collins Harbor) in Maxwell Bay, South Shetland Islands (West Antarctica), a large marine calving embayment, contains repeating couplets of organic-rich massive diamicton and organic-poor stratified diamicton. The massive diamicton is characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) content and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios and was deposited in a cold climate regime by iceberg-rafted sedimentation from coastal fast ice in which algal plants, as well as gravels, were entrained. The stratified diamicton is characterized by low TOC content and C/N ratios and was formed in a warmer climate regime when the flux of icebergs was suppressed, but turbid meltwater discharge continued to produce lamination. When the meltwater discharge decreased in cold climatic conditions, and resultant phytoplankton productivity was reduced due to the increased sea-ice coverage, ice rafting from shorefast sea ice might have played a major role in entraining benthic algae, as well as loads of sand and gravel, along the coastal area, resulting in an increased C/N ratio and gravel content in the massive diamicton. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analyses conducted on well-preserved calcite shells were used to construct a chronology for the past 3000 years. Fluctuations in TOC are recorded (approximately four cycles over this time period), with the average duration of a cooling cycle being !500 years. These cycles may be correlative with the high-frequency (550 yr) variability in reduced Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) on the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf, because a decrease in CDW may be related to reduced deep water production in the North Atlantic during colder periods, as demonstrated for glacial intervals throughout the Pleistocene.

AB  - Coastal erosion caused by sea level rise is a serious problem over the world. Future sea level rise will almost certainly accelerate through the 21st century. Although its extent remains uncertain, some predictions expect the increase to be between up to 30 and 180 cm by 2100 (Nicholls and Cazenave, 2010). Several studies show that sea level rise is responsible for long-term beach erosion. Moreover, change of wave height and non-climate-related processes such as ground subsidence amplify coastal vulnerability associated with climate change. It is a pressing issue to predict shoreline change considering the fact that 10% of the global population lives in the coastal regions within 10 m elevation. This study estimates the potential impact of climate change in terms of the effects of: sea level rise; wave height variation; and land subsidence by comparing the past coastline evolutions at five beaches in Japan. The past long-term shoreline change was found to be related to coastal protection measures according to Japan's national policy (Coast Act). Notable erosion was resulted from the construction of coastal facilities that blocked coastal sand drift and the decrease of sediment supply from rivers caused by dam building from 1950 to 1990. Since 1990, shoreline has relatively unchanged because some measures, such as beach nourishment, groins and detached breakwaters, have worked to conserve sand beaches. The estimation results showed that shoreline would retreat over 15 m due to sea level rise and up to 5 m due to wave height variation at the five beaches by 2100. Projection of ground subsidence is uncertain because its rate varies depending on natural forces and human activities. This study suggests that sea level rise would have much greater impact on beach erosion compared with wave height variation and ground subsidence. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Conference Title: 2014 3rd International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA) Conference Start Date: 2014, June 11 Conference End Date: 2014, June 14 Conference Location: Changsha, China In recent 15 years, the biodiversity of Chongming Dongtan national nature reserve has been dramatically reduced by invasive plants, especially by spartina alterniflora. How to obtain and monitor spatio-temporal change of spartina alterniflora has great practical significance in managing and protecting Chongming Dongtan. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper was to build up a method to recognize different species of salt marsh vegetation and analyze the spatio-temporal change by interpreting remote sensed data of different period. Considering the complexity of different plant' spectral feature, the feature space was consisted of Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kanth-Thomas transformation (K-T transformation) and an optimal band combination. In order to enhance classification accuracy, a dual-weight support vector machine (SVM) classification model by weighting on different features and classes was proposed. The kernel function of this model was selected as wavelet which satisfied the practical situation better. During the experiment, training and validation data were ground survey points located by GPS. The results from this study indicated that the invasion of spartina alterniflora was serious and it kept expanding to the southern. Furthermore, the method proposed in this paper could get higher detection accuracy than the traditional methods and was suitable for the small-sample experiment. Consequently, using this approach could provide timely analytical data for the time and space distribution change of the Salt Marsh Vegetation in intertidal zones, meanwhile the results will provide sound scientific basis for carrying out some proper management and control of Spartina alterniflora.

AB  - The Manasi River wetland represents the culmination of efforts over 50 years by local people to maintain a stable natural resource. Measures taken are a model of ecological engineering construction along inland-rivers of and areas. The main achievements are twelve reservoirs that form a large-scale cluster of wetland reservoirs. These link with the Manasi River to create a dynamic wetland that represents several headwaters. The wetland combats excessive exploitation of groundwater yet allows continuing use of wetland springs. It can help control floods, fight drought, maintaining an ecological balance of natural wetland processes and habitat alongside human activities. The wetland stores and conserves water, with the capacity to moderate both floods and drought. The cluster of wetland reservoirs has a storage capacity of 4.94 x 10(8) m(3). Local conditions are conducive to the cluster acting as head- waters of downstream rivers. The hydro-geological conditions and freedom pollution are important. The wetland helps maintain sustainable development through balancing human needs and beneficial environmental conditions.

AB  - Riparian areas are unique ecosystems and ecotones that provide many ecosystem services. Their importance is even larger in dryland areas because of the water scarcity conditions. This is especially true in the Mediterranean region where their value has been recognized and utilized for thousands of years. This utilization has led to severe their degradation, and in many cases, elimination. The Mediterranean Basin is also considered one of the most sensitive regions to climate change impacts. In this review, review, firstly the characteristics of the riparian areas of the region were identified, based on its climatic and geographic conditions but also anthropogenic impacts. Secondly, the potential impacts of climate change on riparian areas were assessed by understanding the associated effects on the hydrologic regimes of rivers. Flow patterns are expected to become flashier with greater periods of drought and peak flows with higher magnitudes. This should impact the ecological processes of riparian areas and their vegetation assemblages and exacerbate the existing pressures they already face due to the numerous and diverse anthropogenic activities in the region. Based on the current and future conditions, it is imperative that measures should be taken to protect and reestablish riparian corridors in the Mediterranean. Although many areas are protected by initiatives such as the Natura 2000 Network or the the Ramsar Convention, additional and innovative practices need to be implemented. Specifically, the adoption of ecosystem-based approaches such as nature-based solutions and soil and water bioengineering are recommended because they take into consideration the ecosystem services of riparian areas. Even when practices are implemented at a local scale, they need to adopt a watershed scale approach to understand the drivers of riparian areas and the impacts from anthropogenic activities. The key for the successful restoration of riparian areas is restoring the natural hydrologic and geomorphologic regimes. Finally, the methods utilized need to have a transdisciplinary approach that involves academics, policy makers, local experts and stakeholders. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)

AB  - Species profiles are literature summaries of the taxonomy, morphology, distribution, life history, habitats, and environmental requirements of coastal species of fishes and aquatic invertebrates. They are designed to assist in environmental impact assessment. The reef-building tube worm (Sabellariidae) is an ecologically and geologically significant invertebrate inhabiting the coastal zone of southeastern Florida. The reefs constructed by the worms retain beach sediments, protect shorelines from storm damage, and are the basis for an elaborate marine community of fishes and invertebrates. The reefs provide substrate, shelter, and food in the relatively inhospitable surf zone. Reef-building tube worms require stable settlement substrates within sandy beach habitats and intense turbulence to maintain suspension of sand grains and other particles for tube building.

AB  - Five oil refineries discharge into a narrow section of the San Francisco Bay, known as the Carquinez Strait. Previous studies have shown that these discharges increase the concentration of Se in both the water and sediments of this area, potentially threatening local bird populations. As a result of a partnership involving Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Dept. of Energy, and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, selenium cycling in wetlands is being investigated. Two sites, each downstream of a major oil refinery, were characterized with respect to selenium concentration and speciation in surface water, suspended sediment, pore water, marsh sediment, plants, and clams. Sedimentation dynamics were found to be an important factor in Se distribution, because of the high affinity of selenium on suspended sediments and the landward-decreasing energy of the depositional environment. Although more than 99% of sediment selenium is in insoluble forms, concentrations of aqueous selenium in sediment pore water were found to be an order of magnitude higher than in overlying Bay water, suggesting selenium diffusion out of the sediment. Chemical reduction of selenium in both sediments and the water column under experimentally ponded conditions was found to occur on time scales exceeding the duration of tidal flooding of these environments. The implications of these findings bear strongly on the future approach to selenium monitoring, prompting a focus on the sediment-water interface and further research into selenium association with suspended sediment.

AB  - San Andres Island (SW Caribbean, Colombia), an uplifted oceanic atoll of Miocene origin, consists of a well-developed coral and carbonate bank-barrier reef complex. From a former cotton and coconut economy in 1953, it became a major trade and tourist center currently having a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants in a land area of just 25 km super(2). Human activities directly affecting the marine environment have included dredge and fill operations, shipwrecks and groundings, disposal of urban waste, thermal pollution, over-fishing, construction along the shoreline, and diving, boating and beach-going activities. From qualitative observations carried out from 1968 to 1979, and quali- and quantitative resurveys made in 1992 to 1996, major biotic changes became evident in the upper insular platform (0-25 m in depth). These were: a detectable decline in live coral cover (to an overall mean of 30% of hard substrata in 1992), extensive recent coral mortality (overall mean in 1992 of 52% of total live + dead coral cover), almost total disappearance of the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum and the sea-fan Gorgonia ventalina, proliferation of algae (to about 60-70% cover of the overall reef hard substrata in 1992), and an almost total absence of commercial reef organisms, including both carnivores and herbivores.

AB  - The role of salt marsh algal mats in the productivity of a southern California tidal wetland is discussed. The productivity of the mats, which are composed of filamentous blue-green and green algae and diatoms, varies both temporally and spatially in relation to tidal inundation and overstory vegetation. The estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) were highest under the canopy of Jaumea carnosa at low elevation. Elsewhere, NPP appeared to be limited by low light and desiccation. Algal NPP was from 0.8 to 1.4 times that of the vascular plant overstory NPP. It is hypothesized that the arid environment of southern California and resulting hypersaline soils reduce vascular plant cover, which leads to high algal productivity.

AB  - Salt marshes (also spelled saltmarshes) occur where fine sediments accumulate along sheltered shorelines of marine bays, saline lakes, and alkali sinks. Those in intertidal settings are well studied for two reasons (1) salinity reduces plant diversity and inundation/exposure regimes structure composition, facilitating manipulative studies of vegetation-elevation patterns and (2) large expanses of monotypic vegetation are amenable to analysis of ecosystem functions (productivity, nutrient dynamics, food web support, and landscape connectivity). Salt marshes continue to advance science in these areas. Several functions of salt marsh ecosystems are considered services of high value to society, for example, primary productivity, denitrification, and biodiversity support. In urban and agricultural areas, especially bays with major ports, up to 100% of salt marsh area has been destroyed or converted to human uses (e.g., salt ponds, fish ponds, diked and desalted lands for agriculture). Pollution, canals, subsidence, and increasing rates of sea-level rise (with global warming) continue to threaten salt marsh quantity and quality. Restoration efforts are underway in part to manage the retreat anticipated with rising sea level and to replace lost wetlands. Several innovative experiments in salt marshes are advancing both restoration practice and science. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of altered tidal circulation on southern California salt marshes are investigated by comparing a well-flushed wetland and two modified wetlands which have reduced tidal flow. The Tijuana Estuary had continuous exchange of seawater but relatively low net aerial primary productivity (0.4-1.0 kg/mSUP-2 /yr) of vascular plants. Low productivity (0.6 kg/mSUP-2 /yr) was also found in the Flood Control Channel of the San Diego River, where tidal exchange was restricted to flow through a riprap dike. High productivity (1.2-2.9 kg/mSUP-2 /yr) in Los Penasquitos Lagoon was attributed to the influences of freshwater impounded behind a sand bar which blocked the mouth of the lagoon during much of the study period. It is hypothesized that elimination of tidal flow during the growing season increased primary productivity of vascular plants because freshwater runoff decreased soil salinity and because nutrients were retained within the marsh. However, the authors predict that sand bar obstruction can decrease productivity if below-average rainfall leads to hypersalinity of closed lagoons. Comprehensive evaluation of the effects of altered tidal circulation requires long-term study and examination of the total ecosystem.

AB  - In September 1998, during Hurricane Georges, 5,000-10,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil were released from a refinery, oiling freshwater marshes along Lajas Creek near Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Aggressive cleanup actions were taken to protect downstream areas including placement of fill material to access the marsh, limited mechanical scraping and excavation of vegetation and sediments, cutting of oiled vegetation, and dragging of sorbents across the marsh by hand. It was thought at the time that oil would not penetrate the marsh sediments and that the vegetation would recover within 3 months. During irregular site visits from October 1998 through July 2000, the authors checked for the presence/absence of subsurface oiling and made simple field observations of vegetation establishment. Fresh black oil was found in creek levee sediments down to the water table, as deep as 60 cm. The oil penetrated the sediments through root channels, animal burrows, and perhaps desiccation cracks in the clay soils. In wetter, nonlevee sediments, oil was mixed into the substrate, possibly by foot depressions, to 15 cm below the surface. A buried layer of fresh oil also was found under fill material. Penetration of oil into marsh sediments likely was related to the type of marsh and geomorphic features present at the site. In January 1999, revegetation from seed was underway in some areas, although the visual appearance of plant cover and height was less than that observed in nonoiled areas and several large areas lacked vegetation. By July 2000, the vegetation appeared recovered in terms of visual appearance. Though plant recovery probably took more than twice as long as predicted, vegetation recovery time was relatively normal, perhaps even rapid, compared to temperate zone marshes.

AB  - Systematic mass spectrometric 230Th ages are reported for a Porites coral reef terrace from Dengloujiao, Leizhou Peninsula, South China Sea. Seven episodes of coral growth were recognized in this terrace: 7125±96, 6764±29, 5826±37, 5006±54, 2543±24, 1915±15, and 1513±22 calendar years before present (cal. aBP). 50% of the coral age population fall between 7200 and 6600 cal. aBP, marking post-glacial stabilization of global sea level. Considering the facts that (i) Dengloujiao reef flat was measured at 1.6-2.5 m above modern tidal datum plane; (ii) modern Porites corals in the South China Sea are living at least ∼1 m below the modern tidal datum plane; (iii) the top 20-30 cm of the reef was eroded; and (iv) crustal subsidence in the region since mid-Holocene was negligible, we conclude that the above age groups record at least two major periods (7200- 5000 and 2500-1500 cal. aBP) of high sea-level at least 2.9-3.8 m above the present-day level.

AB  - Artificial reefs are common human-made structures placed purposefully on the seabed for fishery enhancement and coastal protection. The local flow patterns could be further created and designed by perforated artificial reefs to become more inhabitable for different fish species, which attracts more attentions from researchers. Thus, based on the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technology, the primary focus of this research is to investigate the flow field of perforated artificial reefs arranged longitudinally with two perforated blocks, and to compare with the flow field of the single reef with the same structure. The results show that, the turbulent flow regime inside and outside the twin-block perforated reef consists of vortices interaction patterns and the main flow becomes weaker along the current direction. Several vortices with different scales are formed inside and behind the reef, and the vortex structure displays certain symmetry in the transverse direction because of symmetrical reef structure. Comparing with the flow field of a single perforated reef, the increase in reef number has little effect on the vertically vortical structure within the reef compartments. However, the influence range and sheltering effect induced by the twin-block reef becomes greater than that in the single reef. This research reveals the geometrical relationship between perforated reef structure and internal flow pattern, and provides a scientific guidance for optimizing the structure and deployment of perforated artificial reefs. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - For centuries flood embankments were constructed to protect the lowlands, properties and the people living within. They are constructed along the coasts and rivers mainly as an earth structures using the fill material that is available on site. Flood embankments are built as "open" structures and have to withstand extreme internal and external processes, such as desiccation or flooding. As the body of the embankment is usually located above the ground, the fill material undergoes series of seasonal variations in climatic conditions which crucially affect the water retention in soils; as a result they swell and shrink. The shrinkage of soils is commonly associated with the formation of cracks, which affect the permeability of the soil. It is usually very difficult to visually assess the extent of cracking covered by vegetation. In this paper, both 2-D and 3-D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) were used to detect desiccation cracking in the soil mass. Two laboratory models, small and macro-scaled, were examined using miniature resistivity array. In addition to that, field investigation was carried out in order to validate laboratory results and in particular to assess the integrity of flood embankment. The results obtained in this research confirm that ERT is capable of detecting desiccation cracking in the subsurface without interfering into the embankment body and can be used for the proper assessment of an embankment body.

It is used to obtain information about the enemy - the collection of intelligence, the search for targets and target indication, observation of the situation, etc. The use of a small intelligence robot is assumed in various natural and climatic conditions: in temperate terrain, on soils with low bearing capacity, at low temperatures, in the desert, on sandy and marshy soils, on rocky soils, in elevated temperature and dustiness of air, and also in conditions highlands In the article an overview of modern developments of remotely controlled robotic military complexes, principles of their construction and perspective directions of development in the armed forces are reviewed. The issues of robotization of existing weapons and military equipment are considered. Every sample of a SSR used in combat action must possess all combat characteristics at once in an optimal ratio between them, ensuring its maximum effectiveness. Ignoring any of the properties or enhancing one property at the expense of others will not enable the full realization of the small surveillance robot. It is reasonable to select the relevant properties at the design stage, using the possibilities of mathematical modeling. The set of tactical and technical characteristics of the SSR allowed forming this. Its characteristics determine the scope and possibilities of application. The mathematical model of the SSR motion is written in the Matlab Simulink environment. Recorded mathematical model of SSR motion, formed single test cycle and input data allowed to conduct computer simulation of motion in possible conditions of operation of small surveillance robot.The single trial cycle presented contains a set of individual sites and reproduces the testing test cycle of a real polygon. On the basis of the developed tactical and technical characteristics of the SSR, the experimental sample was made. An example of the use of SSR for the intelligence of the settlement and at keeping the node of barriers has been provided. The efficiency of performing intelligence units’ tasks and reducing the risk of human losses are shown.</jats:p>

AB  - To determine the importance of microorganisms in regulating the retention of anthropogenic NO3-, we followed the belowground fate and flow of (NO3-)-N-15 in a mature northern hardwood forest. dominated by Acer saccharum Marsh. Total recovery of added N-15 (29.5 mg N-15/m(2) as NaNO3) in inorganic N, microbial immobilization in forest floor and soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and root biomass pools (0-10 cm depth) was 93% two hours following application of the (NO3-)-N-15 but rapidly dropped to similar to 29% within one month, presumably due to movement of the isotope into other plant tissues or deeper into soil. Microbial immobilization was initially (i.e., at 2 h) the largest sink for (NO3-)-N-15 (21% in forest floor; 16% in soil microbial biomass). After one month, total N-15 recovery varied little (24-18%) throughout the remainder of the growing season, suggesting that the major N transfers among pools occurred relatively rapidly. At the end of the four-month experiment, the main fates of the N-15 label were in soil organic matter (7%), root biomass (6%), and N immobilized in forest floor and soil microbial biomass (6%). Temporal changes in the N-15 enrichment (atom % excess N-15) Of plant and soil pools during the first month of the experiment indicated the dynamic nature of NO3 cycling in this Forest. The N-15 enrichment of soil microbial biomass and the forest floor significantly increased two hours after isotope additions, suggesting rapid microbial immobilization of NO3-. In contrast, the N-15 enrichment of soil organic matter did not peak until day 1, presumably because much of the added N-15 cycled through microorganisms before becoming stabilized in soil organic matter, or it directly entered soil organic matter via physical processes. Furthermore, the N-15 enrichment of root biomass (<0.5-mm diameter and 0.5-2.0 mm diameter) was greatest between day 7 and day 28, following significant increases in the N-15 enrichment of soil organic matter (day 1) and, more importantly, NH4+ (day 2). From these data we conclude that microorganisms are immediate. short-term sinks for anthropogenic NO3-. Although the long-term fate of NO3- additions to this forest is likely in soil organic matter and plants, the cycling of N through microorganisms appears to be the major short-term factor influencing patterns of NO3- retention in this ecosystem.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to summarize the environmental design applied in terms of the resilience of the coastal front of the cities. The various alternative protective methods and projects are presented, and their applicability and degree of acceptance today are examined. In the context of the integrated environmental planning on the coastal front of the cities, it is considered necessary to adopt the protect - accommodate - retreat target. Regarding the protection measures, beyond the traditional methods of technical works and mechanical shielding of the coastal front, the exploitation of natural infrastructures and ecosystems is presented as relevant alternatives. The current scientific consensus characterizes the use of natural infrastructure towards coastal protection as an innovative and flexible method, easily adaptable to the local circumstances, and with additional environmental benefits to the city. In the case of the coastal cities, these methods are called upon to address challenges that go beyond their nature and relate to the impact of urban physiognomy on them. In terms of such hybrid applications (combination of natural and technical infrastructure) in coastal cities, most of them are recorded in Southeast Asia and USA. New York seems to be the first city in the world that chose to develop and implement hybrid methods of coastal protection. Our research concludes that although natural infrastructure looks initially as the desired and more sustainable solution for the protection of the cities’ coastal front, nevertheless the adoption of hybrid systems, i.e. the combination of technical projects and physical infrastructure, is considered more feasible. In this frame, already located technical projects are utilized and benefits of both methods are exploited, while in parallel the existence of a “double line” of defense increases the levels of protection of the coastal front and integrates smoothly the water element within the city.
